[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.000]   Ralph's. Fresh for Everyone.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.400]   "The hungrier one becomes, the clearer one's mind works.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.000]   Also, the more sensitive one becomes to the odors of food."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Tarkad, the son of Azur, certainly thought so.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.600]   "For two whole days he had tasted no food, except two small figs purloined from over the wall of a garden.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800]   Not another could he grab before the angry woman rushed forth and chased him down the street.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   Her shrill cries were still ringing in his ears as he walked through the marketplace.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   They helped him to restrain his restless fingers from snatching the tempting fruits from the baskets of the market women.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.400]   Never before had he realized how much food was brought to the markets of Babylon, and how good it smelled.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Leaving the market, he walked across to the inn and paced back and forth in front of the eating house.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   Perhaps here he might meet someone he knew, someone from whom he could borrow a copper
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   that would gain him a smile from the unfriendly keeper of the inn, and with it a liberal helping.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   Without the copper, he knew all too well how unwelcome he would be.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   In his abstraction, he unexpectedly found himself face to face with the one man he wished most to avoid,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   the tall, bony figure of Dabasir, the camel trader.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   Of all the friends and others from whom he had borrowed small sums, Dabasir made him feel the most uncomfortable
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   because of his failure to keep his promises to repay promptly.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   Dabasir's face lighted up at the sight of him.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   "Ha! 'Tis Tarkhad, just the one I have been seeking, that he might repay the two pieces of copper which I lent him a moon ago.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   Also, the piece of silver which I lent to him before that. We are well met. I could make good use of the coins this very day. What say, boy, what say?"
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Tarkhad stuttered, and his face flushed.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   He had not in his empty stomach to nerve him to argue with the outspoken Dabasir.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   "I'm sorry, very sorry," he mumbled weakly, "but this day I have neither the copper nor the silver with which I could repay."
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   "Then get it," Dabasir insisted. "Surely thou canst get hold of a few coppers and a piece of silver to repay the generosity of an old friend of thy father who aided thee whence thou wast in need?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   'Tis because ill fortune does pursue me that I cannot pay."
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   "Ill fortune? What'st blame the gods for thine own weakness? Ill fortune pursues every man who thinks more of borrowing than of repaying.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   Come with me, boy, while I eat. I am hungry, and I would tell thee a tale."
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Tarkhad flinched from the brutal frankness of Dabasir, but here at least was an invitation to enter the coveted doorway of the eating-house.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   Dabasir pushed him to a far corner of the room where they seated themselves upon small rugs.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   When Khaoskor, the proprietor, appeared smiling, Dabasir addressed him with his usual freedom.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   "Fat lizard of the desert, bring to me a leg of the goat, very brown, with much juice and bread and all of the vegetables, for I am hungry and want much food.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   Do not forget my friend here. Bring to him a jug of water. Have it cooled, for the day is hot."
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   Tarkhad's heart sank. Must he sit here and drink water while he watched this man devour an entire goat leg?
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   He said nothing. He thought of nothing he could say.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Dabasir, however, knew no such thing as silence.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   Smiling and waving his hand good-naturedly to the other customers, all of whom knew him, he continued,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   "I did hear from a traveler just returned from Urfa of a certain rich man who has a piece of stone cut so thin that one can look through it.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   He put it in the window of his house to keep out the rains.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   It is yellow, so this traveler does relate, and he was permitted to look through it and all the outside world looked strange and not like it really is.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   What say you to that, Tarkhad? Thinkest all the world could look to a man a different color from what it is?"
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   "I dare say," responded the youth, much more interested in the fat leg of goat placed before Dabasir.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   "Well, I know it to be true, for I myself have seen the world all of a different color from what it really is,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   and the tale I am about to tell relates how I came to see it in its right color once more."
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   "Dabasir will tell a tale," whispered a neighboring diner to his neighbor and dragged his rug close.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Other diners brought their food and crowded in a semicircle.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   They crunched noisily in the ears of Tarkhad and brushed him with their meaty bones.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   He alone was without food.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   Dabasir did not offer to share with him, nor even motion him to a small corner of the hard bread that was broken off and had fallen from the platter to the floor.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   "The tale that I am about to tell," began Dabasir, pausing to bite a goodly chunk from the goat leg,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   "relates to my early life and how I came to be a camel trader.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Didst anyone know that I once was a slave in Syria?" A murmur of surprise ran through the audience, to which Dabasir listened with satisfaction.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   "When I was a young man," continued Dabasir, after another vicious onslaught on the goat leg,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   "I learned the trade of my father, the making of saddles.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   I worked with him in his shop and took to myself a wife.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   Being young and not greatly skilled, I could earn but little, just enough to support my excellent wife in a modest way.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   I craved good things which I could not afford.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   Soon I found that the shopkeepers would trust me to pay later, even though I could not pay at the time.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   Being young and without experience, I did not know that he who spends more than he earns
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   is sowing the winds of needless self-indulgence, from which he is sure to reap the whirlwinds of trouble and humiliation.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   So I indulged my whims for fine raiment and bought luxuries for my good wife and our home beyond our means.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   I paid as I could, and for a while all went well.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   But in time I discovered I could not use my earnings both to live upon and to pay my debts.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   Creditors began to pursue me to pay for my extravagant purchases, and my life became miserable.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   I borrowed from my friends but could not repay them either.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   Things went from bad to worse.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   My wife returned to her father, and I decided to leave Babylon and seek another city, where a young man might have better chances.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   For two years I had a restless and unsuccessful life, working for caravan traders.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   To this I fell in with a set of likable robbers, who scoured the desert for unarmed caravans.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   Such deeds were unworthy of the son of my father, but I was seeing the world through a colored stone,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   and did not realize to what degradation I had fallen.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   We met with success on our first trip, capturing a rich haul of gold and silks and valuable merchandise.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   This loot we took to Ginear and squandered.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   The second time we were not so fortunate.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   Just after we had made our capture, we were attacked by the spearsmen of a native chief to whom the caravans paid for protection.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   Our two leaders were killed, and the rest of us were taken to Damascus, where we were stripped of our clothing and sold as slaves.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   I was purchased for two pieces of silver by a Syrian desert chief.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   With my hair shorn and but a loincloth to wear, I was not so different from the other slaves.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   Being a reckless youth, I thought it merely an adventure,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   until my master took me before his four wives and told them they could have me for a eunuch.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   Then indeed did I realize the hopelessness of my situation.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   These men of the desert were fierce and warlike.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   I was subject to their will without weapons or means of escape.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   Fearful I stood as those four women looked me over.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   I wondered if I could expect pity from them.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   Syrah, the first wife, was older than the others.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   Her face was impassive as she looked upon me.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   I turned from her with little consolation.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   The next was a contemptuous beauty who gazed at me as indifferently as if I had been a worm of the earth.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   The two younger ones tittered as though it were all an exciting joke.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   It seemed an age that I stood waiting sentence.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   Each woman appeared willing for the others to decide.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Finally, Syrah spoke up in a cold voice.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   "Of eunuchs we have plenty, but of camel-tenders we have few, and they are a worthless lot.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   Even this day I would visit my mother who is sick with the fever,
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   and there is no slave I would trust to lead my camel.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   Ask this slave if he can lead a camel."
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   My master thereupon questioned me.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   "What know you of camels?"
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   Striving to conceal my eagerness, I replied,
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   "I can make them kneel, I can load them, I can lead them on long trips without tiring.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   If need be, I can repair their trappings."
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   "The slave speaks forward enough," observed my master.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   "If thou so desire, Syrah, take this man for thy camel-tender."
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   So I was turned over to Syrah, and that day I led her camel upon a long journey to her sick mother.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   I took the occasion to thank her for her intercession,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   and also to tell her that I was not a slave by birth,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   but the son of a free man, an honorable saddle-maker of Babylon.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   I also told her much of my story.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   Her comments were disconcerting to me as I pondered much afterwards on what she said.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   "How can you call yourself a free man when your weakness has brought you to this?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   If a man has in himself the soul of a slave,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   will he not become one no matter what his birth, even as water seeks its level?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   If a man has within him the soul of a free man,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   will he not become respected and honored in his own city in spite of his misfortune?"
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   For over a year I was a slave and lived with the slaves,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   but I could not become as one of them.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   One day Syrah asked me, "In the even time when the other slaves can mingle and enjoy the society of each other,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   why dost thou sit in thy tent alone?"
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   To which I responded, "I am pondering what you have said to me.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   I wonder if I have the soul of a slave.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   I cannot join them, so I must sit apart."
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   "I too must sit apart," she confided.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   "My dowry was large and my lord married me because of it.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Yet he does not desire me.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   What every woman longs for is to be desired.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   Because of this and because I am barren and have neither son nor daughter, must I sit apart?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   Were I a man, I would rather die than be such a slave,
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   but the conventions of our tribe make slaves of women."
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   "What think thou of me by this time?" I asked her suddenly.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   "Have I the soul of a man or have I the soul of a slave?
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   Have you a desire to repay the just debts you owe in Babylon?"
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   She parried.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   "Yes, I have the desire, but I see no way."
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   "If thou contentedly let the years slip by and make no effort to repay,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   then thou hast but the contemptible soul of a slave.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   No man is otherwise who cannot respect himself,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   and no man can respect himself who does not repay honest debts."
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   "But what can I do, who am a slave in Syria?"
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   "Stay a slave in Syria, thou weakling."
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   "I am not a weakling," I denied hotly.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   "Then prove it."
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   "How?"
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   "Does not thy great king fight his enemies in every way he can and with every force he has?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   Thy debts are thy enemies.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   They ran thee out of Babylon.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   You left them alone and they grew too strong for thee.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   Hadst thou fought them as a man, thou couldst have conquered them
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   and been one honored among the townspeople.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   But thou had not the soul to fight them,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   and behold thy pride has gone down until thou art a slave in Syria."
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Much I thought over her unkind accusations
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   and many defensive phrases I worded to prove myself not a slave at heart,
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   but I was not to have the chance to use them.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   Three days later the maid of Syrah took me to her mistress.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   "My mother is again very sick," she said.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   "Saddle the two best camels in my husband's herd.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   Tie on water skins and saddlebags for a long journey.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   The maid will give thee food at the kitchen tent."
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   I packed the camels, wondering much at the quantity of provisions the maid provided,
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   for the mother dwelt less than a day's journey away.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   The maid rode the rear camel which followed, and I led the camel of my mistress.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   When we reached her mother's house it was just dark.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   Syrah dismissed the maid and said to me,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   "Davasir, hast thou the soul of a free man, or the soul of a slave?"
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   "The soul of a free man," I insisted.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   "Now is thy chance to prove it.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   Thy master hath imbibed deeply, and his chiefs are in a stupor.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   Take then these camels and make thy escape.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   Here in this bag is raiment of thy master's to disguise thee.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   I will say thou stole the camels and ran away while I visited my sick mother."
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   "Thou hast the soul of a queen," I told her.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   "Much do I wish that I might lead thee to happiness."
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   "Happiness," she responded,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   "awaits not the runaway wife who seeks it in far lands among strange people.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   Go thy own way, and may the gods of the desert protect thee,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   for the way is far and barren of food or water."
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   I needed no further urging, but thanked her warmly and was away into the night.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   I knew not this strange country,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   and had only a dim idea of the direction in which lay Babylon,
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   but struck out bravely across the desert toward the hills.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   One camel I rode, and the other I led.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   All that night I traveled, and all the next day,
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   urged on by the knowledge of the terrible fate that was meted out to slaves
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   who stole their master's property and tried to escape.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   Late that afternoon I reached a rough country as uninhabitable as the desert.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   The sharp rocks bruised the feet of my faithful camels,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   and soon they were picking their way slowly and painfully along.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   I met neither man nor beast,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   and could well understand why they shunned this inhospitable land.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It was such a journey from then on as few men live to tell of.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   Day after day we plotted along.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   Food and water gave out.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   The heat of the sun was merciless.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   At the end of the ninth day I slid from the back of my mount
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   with the feeling that I was too weak to ever remount,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   and I would surely die, lost in this abandoned country.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   I stretched out upon the ground and slept,
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   not waking until the first gleam of daylight.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   I sat up and looked about me.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   There was a coolness in the morning air.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   My camels lay dejected not far away.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   About me was a vast waste of broken country,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   covered with rock and sand and thorny things,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   no sign of water, not to eat for man or camels.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   Could it be that in this peaceful quiet I faced my end?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   My mind was clearer than it had ever been before.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   My body now seemed of little importance.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   My parched and bleeding lips, my dry and swollen tongue,
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   my empty stomach, all had lost their supreme agonies of the day before.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   I looked across into the uninviting distance
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   and once again came to me the question,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   "Have I the soul of a slave or the soul of a free man?"
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   Then, with clearness, I realized that if I had the soul of a slave,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   I should give up, lie down in the desert, and die,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   a fitting end for a runaway slave.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   But if I had the soul of a free man, what then?
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   Surely I would force my way back to Babylon,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   repay the people who had trusted me,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   bring happiness to my wife who truly loved me,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   and bring peace and contentment to my parents.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   "Thy debts are thine enemies who have run thee out of Babylon,"
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Syrah had said. Yes, it was so.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Why had I refused to stand my ground like a man?
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Why had I permitted my wife to go back to her father?
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Then a strange thing happened.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   All the world seemed to be of a different color,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   as though I had been looking at it through a colored stone
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   which had suddenly been removed.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   At last, I saw the true values in life.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   Die in the desert? Not I.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   With a new vision, I saw the things I must do.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   First, I would go back to Babylon and face every man
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   to whom I owed an unpaid debt.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   I should tell them that after years of wandering and misfortune,
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   I had come back to pay my debts as fast as the gods would permit.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   Next, I should make a home for my wife
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   and become a citizen of whom my parents should be proud.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   My debts were my enemies, but the men I owed were my friends,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   for they had trusted me and believed in me.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   I staggered weakly to my feet.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   What mattered, hunger? What mattered, thirst?
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   They were but incidents on the road to Babylon.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   Within me surged the soul of a free man
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   going back to conquer his enemies and reward his friends.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   I thrilled with a great resolve.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   The glazed eyes of my camels brightened at the new note in my husky voice.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   With great effort, after many attempts, they gained their feet.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   With pitiful perseverance, they pushed on toward the north,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   where something within me said we would find Babylon.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   We found water.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   We passed into a more fertile country, where were grass and fruit.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   We found the trail to Babylon, because the soul of a free man
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   while the soul of a slave whines, "What can I do, who am but a slave?"
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   How about thee, Tarkhad?
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   Dost thy empty stomach make thy head exceedingly clear?
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   Art ready to take the road that leads back to self-respect?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   Canst thou see the world in its true color?
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   Hast thou the desire to pay thy honest debts, however many they may be,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   and once again be a man respected in Babylon?
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Moisture came to the eyes of the youth.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   He rose eagerly to his knees.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   Thou hast shown me a vision already.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   I feel the soul of a free man surge within me.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   "But how fared you upon your return?" questioned an interested listener.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   "Where the determination is, the way can be found," Dabasir replied.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   I now had the determination, so I set out to find a way.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   First, I visited every man to whom I was indebted,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   and begged his indulgence until I could earn that with which to repay.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   Most of them met me gladly.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   Several reviled me, but others offered to help me.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   One indeed did give me the very help I needed.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   It was Maithon, the goldlender.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   Learning that I had been a camel tender in Syria,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   he sent me to old Nebatur, the camel trader,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   just commissioned by our good king to purchase many herds of sound camels for the great expedition.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   With him, my knowledge of camels I put to good use.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   Gradually, I was able to repay every copper and every piece of silver.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   Then at last I could hold up my head and feel that I was an honorable man among men.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   Again, Dabasir turned to his food.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   "Cowsgore, thou snail!" he called loudly to be heard in the kitchen.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   "The food is cold! Bring me more meat, fresh from the roasting.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   Bring thou also a very large portion for Tarkhad,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   the son of my old friend who is hungry, and shall eat with me."
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   So ended the tale of Dabasir, the camel trader of old Babylon.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   He found his own soul when he realized a great truth,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   a truth that had been known and used by wise men long before his time.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   It has led men of all ages out of difficulties and into success,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   and it will continue to do so for those who have the wisdom to understand its magic power.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   It is for any man to use who reads these lines.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   Where the determination is, the way can be found.
