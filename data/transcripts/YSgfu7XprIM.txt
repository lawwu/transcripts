[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   - And your building is out of your garage, correct?
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.360]   So the blockchain application, I'm actually like,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.120]   you know, which excites me personally the most
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.080]   is re-imagining enterprise software.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.440]   You're gonna be like Kardash, whatever scale civilization,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   where you're using like immense amounts of energy.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.680]   Like that's gonna have, you know, side effects
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.360]   and you're gonna have to figure out
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.080]   how to manage that one way or the other.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.920]   I mean, one of those is eventually
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.720]   Earth may just be like a nature preserve
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.040]   and we all live in space or something, but.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.880]   - Okay, today I have the pleasure
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.560]   of interviewing Austin Vernon,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.560]   who writes about engineering, software, economics,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.620]   investing on the internet,
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.520]   but not that much else is known about him.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.840]   So Austin, do you wanna give us a bit about your background?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   I know that the only thing the internet knows about you
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.000]   is this one little JPEG
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640]   that you had to upload with your recent paper,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   but what about an identity reveal,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.040]   or I guess a little bit of a background reveal
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.760]   to the extent that you're willing to,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.800]   comfortable sharing.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   - My degree is in chemical engineering
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600]   and I'm kind of like a lifelong love of engineering
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.280]   and also things like Toyota production system
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.400]   and stuff like that.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   And I've worked as a chemical engineer,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.640]   like in a large processing facility.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.240]   I've done a lot of petroleum engineering.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.600]   Let's see, and then now, you know,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.640]   I taught myself how to write software
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.920]   and now I'm working on kind of like more research,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.880]   early commercialization of CO2 electrolysis.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.720]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.120]   So I'm really interested in talking about all those things.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   But so I guess the first question I have is Alex Berger,
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.560]   who is the co-CEO of Open Philanthropy.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.480]   He asked this question when I asked on Twitter
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   what I should ask you and he suggested I should ask you
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   why so shady?
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.960]   So you have, I mean, famously,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.000]   you have kind of like a anonymous personality,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.840]   pseudonymous thing you have on the internet.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   What's up with that?
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.280]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   When, you know, I think he posted a tweet that said,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   you know, like, I don't know who this guy is
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.120]   or like if he's credible at all,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.000]   but you know, his stuff sure is interesting.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   That really made me laugh.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.200]   I thought it was hilarious.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.400]   It just doesn't seem necessary.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.240]   I think I'm fine with my ideas being well known
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   and communicating, but I have less desire
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.780]   to be like personally famous, so.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.040]   - I gotcha, I gotcha.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.400]   I wanted to start off with a sexy topic.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.360]   So let's talk about using Starship as a kinetic weapon.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480]   I thought that was like one of the more amusing posts
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.320]   you wrote.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.380]   Do you want to talk more about how this would be possible?
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.520]   - Well, I think the main thing with Starship
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.840]   is like it's, you know, you're taking a technology
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   and you're making it about a hundred times cheaper
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.400]   for cargo and a thousand times cheaper for people.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   So when things like that happen that drastically,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   you're just like looking at huge changes
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.520]   and it's really hard to anticipate what some of those can be
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.760]   when the change is that drastic.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.520]   So I think there's like a lot of moon-based,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.640]   Mars-based stuff that, you know,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.160]   doesn't really catch the regular public's eye.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   And I think they also have trouble imagining
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   some of the like point-to-point travel
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.320]   that could be possible.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.480]   But as far as like, you know, you start talking about it
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.640]   like as a weapon, and I think that's, you know,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.720]   it lets people know they should be paying attention
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   to this technology.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.000]   And we'd certainly do not want to be second or third
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.840]   getting it.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.160]   And we should make sure that we're going to be first.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.000]   - Yeah, I think you mentioned this in the post,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.760]   but so as recently as the nineties,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.240]   the cost of sending one kilogram to space
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.600]   was around 20,000.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   More recently, SpaceX has brought it to 2000.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   And then there's like a lot of interesting questions
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.240]   you can ask when you ask what will be possible
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.880]   once we get it down to $200 per kilogram
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280]   to send into orbit.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.560]   Yeah, so one of them might be to manufacture these weapons
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   that are not conventional ballistics.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.360]   But do you want to talk about like why this might be
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.440]   an advancement over conventional ballistic weapons?
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.280]   - Well, regular conventional ballistic weapons
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.400]   are extremely expensive.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.600]   You know, this is more like a bomb truck, you know,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.960]   but it's even like, usually we think of like B-52
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   as the bomb truck and this could be even, you know,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   cheaper than the B-52 delivering just like mass on target.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.120]   When you think about like how expensive it is to fly B-52
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.760]   from like Barksdale, Louisiana, all the way across the world,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.080]   you can do it from South Texas or Florida with the Starship
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.720]   and get, you know, more missions per day.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   And the fuel ends up being like, when you go orbital,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.960]   it takes a lot to get to orbit,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.240]   but then once you're in orbit,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.800]   your fuel consumption's pretty good.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.680]   So over long distances, it has a lot of advantage.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.080]   That's why the point to point works
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.560]   for like the longer distances.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.120]   There's really like a sweet spot with these weapons
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.580]   where you want it to be like pretty accurate,
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.720]   but you also want it to be cheap.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.240]   Like you're seeing that problem with like Russia right now
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.280]   is they have some like, you know, fancy parade style weapons
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280]   that are really expensive,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.600]   like multi-billion dollar cruise missiles,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.800]   but they're missing like that, you know,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.240]   $5,000 guided artillery shell or like that, you know,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.800]   like $20,000 JDM that you can just like put massive
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   or the, you know, the multiple launch rocket system,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.440]   guided rockets.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.880]   They're really like short on all those.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.720]   'Cause I think they had just had like a limited amount
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200]   of chips they could get from the U.S. and to Russia
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   to make these advanced weapons.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.000]   But yeah, so the, it kind of the Starship gives you
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.840]   just like a platform to deliver, like you could, you know,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.920]   put JDMs in a shroud or you could just like, you know,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.480]   have the iron unguided kinetic projectiles.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.880]   And it just becomes impossible for, you know,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.040]   a ship to launch missiles to intercept yours
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.000]   if your cost is so low, you can just overwhelm them.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.320]   - Okay, there are a few terms there that neither I
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.360]   nor the audience might know.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   So what is JDM, what is shroud
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.400]   and why are chips a bottleneck here?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.960]   Like, why can't it just be any microcontroller?
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.560]   - So JDM is joint direct attack munition.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   So what we did is we took all like our Vietnam surplus bombs
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.840]   and we put this like a little like fin kit on it
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.960]   and it costs like 20,000 bucks, which is cheap for a weapon.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   'Cause it, you know, the actual bomb costs,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.480]   like, I don't know, 3000 bucks.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   And then you, it turns, you know,
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.200]   it into a guided weapon that before you're,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.000]   you were probably lucky to get within 500 meters of target.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.520]   Now you can get it in with like two meters.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.000]   So the number of missions you have to do with your planes
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.800]   and all that goes down by like orders of magnitude.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.960]   So it's absolutely like huge advantage in logistics
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.080]   and just how much firepower you can put on a target.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.480]   And the, and you know, like,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.760]   we didn't even have to make new bombs.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.960]   We just put these kits on all our old bombs.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.480]   Let's see, then the chips are a problem.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.520]   There's like this organization called RUSI.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.240]   I think they're in the UK,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.680]   but they've been tearing down like all these Russian weapons
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.120]   they found in Ukraine
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.320]   and they all have American chips in them.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   So, you know, technically we were supposed to like,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   they're not supposed to be able to get these chips.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.000]   And you know, Russia can't make a lot of its own chips
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.760]   and especially not the specialized kinds
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.480]   you might want for guided weapons.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.800]   So they've been somehow smuggling in chips from Americans
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.480]   to make their advanced weapons.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.680]   - What is special about these?
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.160]   I would assume that like, they haven't like,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.480]   as far as I'm aware,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.920]   trade with China is still going on, right?
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.800]   And we get a lot of our chips manufactured
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.040]   from Taiwan or China.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.400]   So why can't they do the same?
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.720]   - It's the whole like integration.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   Like, you know, it's not just like a specific chip,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   but like the board, it's like,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.080]   they're more like PLCs where you're like,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.400]   why almost have like wired in programming
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   and stuff like that.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   And they come with like this,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.920]   like to be able to do the guidance and all that stuff.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.560]   It all kind of has to work together.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.760]   I think that's the way I understand it.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.400]   Maybe I don't have a really good answer for that one,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.080]   but they're hard to replicate is what matters.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.440]   - Okay, that's interesting.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.680]   Yeah, and I guess that has a lot of interesting
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.840]   downstream effects because for example,
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.320]   India buys a lot of its weaponry from Russia, right?
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   So if Russia doesn't have access to these,
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.720]   then other countries that buy from Russia
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.560]   won't have access to these either.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.880]   You had an interesting speculation in the post
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.320]   where you suggested that you could just keep
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   these kinetic weapons in orbit,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.880]   like a sort of Damocles really, almost literally.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   That sounds like a really scary and risky scenario
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.560]   where, I don't know, you can have orbital decay
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.400]   and you can have these kinetic weapons
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.320]   falling from the sky and destroying cities.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   Do you think this is what it will look like
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.360]   and could look like in 10 to 20 years?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.600]   - Well, yeah, so the advantage of having on orbit
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.240]   is you can hit targets faster.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   So if you're launching the rocket from Florida,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.720]   you're looking at like maybe 30 minutes to get there.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.880]   So target moves in that time.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.960]   Whereas if you're on orbit,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   you can have them spaced out to where you're hitting
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.360]   within like a few minutes.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.480]   So that's the advantage there.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.160]   When you actually look at like the...
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.200]   You really have to have like a two-stage system,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.720]   I think, for most because if you have
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.400]   like a really aerodynamic rod,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.920]   that's gonna give you good performance
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.320]   in the low atmosphere.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.400]   It'll get going too fast and just like burn up
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.480]   before you get there.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.800]   Tungsten's maybe the only thing that you could have
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.040]   that could go all the way through.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.600]   That's why I like the original concept,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.280]   use these big tungsten like rods
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.000]   the size of like a telephone pole.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   But tungsten's pretty expensive
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   and like just the rod concept,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.440]   it kind of limits what you can do
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.920]   if you just do the rods.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.840]   So a lot of these weapons will have like,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.560]   that's why I was talking about like with the shroud,
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.800]   like something that actually slows you down
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.640]   in the upper atmosphere.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.320]   And then once you're to the velocity
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.880]   where you're not just gonna melt,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.840]   then you open it up and let it go.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.040]   So if you actually had it fall from the sky,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.560]   some may make it to the ground,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.440]   but a lot would burn up.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.200]   So a lot of the stuff that makes it to the ground
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.520]   is actually pretty light.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.880]   It's like stuff that can kind of like float
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.640]   and has a large surface area.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.160]   Yeah, so that's like the whole thing with Starship,
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.440]   like they're not Starship, but Starlink,
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.640]   all those satellites are meant to completely,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.800]   you know, fall apart on the orbit.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.840]   - I see.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.120]   Like one of the implications of that
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.480]   is that these may be less powerful than we might fear
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.000]   because if kinetic energy is mass times,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.320]   you know, velocity squared,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.840]   then you have to,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.440]   if there's an upper bound on the velocity
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.120]   and then the velocity is the component
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.480]   that grows the kinetic energy faster,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.040]   then it suggests that you can upper bound
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.760]   the power these things will have.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   - Yeah, so even the tungsten rods,
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.240]   sometimes people like, you know,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.520]   they're not good at physics or something,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.960]   so they don't like do the math.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.400]   They think it's gonna be like a nuclear weapon,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.560]   but it's really, I think even the tungsten rod,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.480]   I might've put it in there.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.920]   I think if I'm remembering correctly,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.880]   like 10 tons of TNT or something,
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.640]   it's like a big bomb,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.200]   but it's not, you know, it's not like a super weapon.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.160]   So that's what I think I said in the post.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.120]   It really has like, it's like advanced missiles
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.560]   where they're almost more defensive weapons.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.880]   So I can keep you from putting your ship somewhere,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.720]   you know, and like, yeah,
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.400]   I could like try to bombard your cities,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   but I can't take ground with it.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.560]   You know, I can't even like police sea lanes with it really.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.840]   I'd still have to have regular ships,
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   you know, if I had this air cover essentially
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.600]   to, you know, go like enforce the rules of the sea
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.160]   and board freighters and stuff like that.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.240]   - Yeah. So you speculated in the post,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.640]   I think that you could have like potentially these,
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.520]   you could like load this up with shrapnel
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.040]   and then it could like explode next to an incoming missile
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.800]   or an incoming aircraft.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.880]   Yeah. Could these get that accurate?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.120]   'Cause that was surprising speculation to me.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.720]   - Yeah. I think like for ships, I think it's pretty,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.640]   you know, like I was like watching videos of, you know,
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.480]   how fast a ship can turn and stuff.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   'Cause you'd want to like release your shrapnel,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.560]   you know, if you were going to like do an initial target
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.560]   on a ship to like try to kill their radars and stuff,
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.200]   you'd want to do it above the ceiling of their missiles.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.880]   So it's like, how much are they going to move
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.600]   between your release where you stop steering and that?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.000]   And it's really, you know, it's like maybe like a thousand feet.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.400]   So that's pretty simple.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.000]   You just like shrapnel the area.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   The aircraft you would be steering all the way in.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So it's maybe actually, I'd say it's doable,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.560]   but it'd be pretty hard. Yeah.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.760]   And you'd actually maybe want to even go slower
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.040]   than you would with the ship attack.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.960]   You know, you need like a specialized package
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.920]   to do the aircraft, but you can see these aircraft on,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.840]   like if you have enough synthetic aperture radar
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   and stuff like that, you can see them with satellites
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.360]   and then guide it in the whole way.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.400]   You could even like, say, load like heat-seeking missiles
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.280]   into a package that, you know, stop, you know,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.400]   unfurls right next to them
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.320]   and launch conventional missiles too, probably.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.600]   And that'd be pretty hard to do, some of this stuff,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.760]   but it's just like kind of, you know,
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.800]   the things you might be able to do
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.640]   if you put some effort into it.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.400]   - Yeah, the reason I find this kind of speculation
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.880]   really interesting is because when you look
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.560]   at the modern weaponry that's used in conflicts,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.640]   it often seems like, it just seems like directly descended
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.720]   from something you would have seen
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   in World War II or something.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.920]   It doesn't seem like, if you think about like
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.000]   how much warfare changed between like 1900 and 1940,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.360]   it's like, yeah, they're not even the same class
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.920]   of weapons anymore.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.240]   So it's interesting to think about possibilities like these
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   where the entire category of weapons has changed.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.600]   - All right, and that's because, you know, the same thing,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.040]   like, you know, our physical technology
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.000]   hasn't changed that much.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.520]   So it really has just made more sense
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.680]   to like put better electronics in the same tanks we have
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.560]   than to build it, like, you're just not gonna get,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.920]   we haven't learned enough about tanks
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.720]   to build like a new physical tank that's way better.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.640]   So we just keep upgrading our existing tanks
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.000]   with better electronics.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.960]   So they're much more powerful.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.760]   They're more accurate.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   You know, a lot of times they have longer range weapons.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.240]   They have better sensors.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.520]   So the tank looks the same, but, you know,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   it may be as like several times more like killing power,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.160]   what have you.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.440]   But, you know, the Ukraine war right now kind of,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.000]   you know, they're using a lot of like 40, 50 year old
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.240]   weapons, so that especially looks like that.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   - Yeah, yeah, which kind of worries you
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.800]   if you think about the stockpiles our own military has.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.960]   I'm not well-educated on the topic,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   but I imagine that we don't have the newest
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.800]   of the new thing, right?
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.000]   Like we'll probably have maintained versions
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.240]   of decades old technology.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.160]   - You know, I mean, we spend so much we've got relatively,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.760]   let's say this kind of gets into like,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.120]   there's a lot of debate about like how ready our military is
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.040]   and for certain situations it's more ready than others.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.000]   I'd say in general, most people talking about
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   have the incentive to downplay our capabilities
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.120]   'cause they want more defense spending
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.160]   or just there's lots of reasons.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.600]   So I think we're probably more capable
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.680]   than what you might see from like, you know,
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.760]   some editorial in the Hill or whatever.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   And I think just like us just sending a few weapons
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.880]   over to Ukraine and how successful they've been using them
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.640]   I think shows a little bit of that.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   But there's so much uncertainty when it comes to fighting,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.680]   you know, especially when you're talking
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.880]   about like a naval engagement,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.680]   whether we just don't have that many ships in general,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.960]   you can have some bad luck.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.880]   So I think, you know, you always wanna be a little bit wary,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.920]   you know, don't wanna get overconfident.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.880]   - Yeah, and if the offensive tech we sent to Ukraine
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.320]   is potentially better than the defensive tech,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.440]   like it's very possible that even a ballistic missile
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.840]   that China or Russia could launch could sink
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.080]   like a battleship and then kill 2000, you know,
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.320]   a thousand or whatever soldiers that are on board.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.120]   Or I guess, I don't know, you think this opens up avenues
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.680]   for defensive tech as well or?
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.480]   - Yeah, I mean, generally the consensus is that
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.880]   defensive technology has improved much more recently
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.760]   than offensive technology.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.920]   And there's a China, this whole like strategy China has,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.560]   they call, it's like area denial,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.920]   anti-access area denial, A2/AD.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.760]   And so that's basically just like missiles
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.400]   have gotten better 'cause the sensors on missiles
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.080]   have gotten better so they can keep our ships
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.680]   from getting close to them.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.600]   But you know, they can't really challenge us
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.000]   like in Hawaii or something.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.360]   And it really goes both ways.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   I think people forget that.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.640]   So yeah, it's like hard for us to get close to China,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.160]   but you know, Taiwan has a lot of missiles
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.560]   with these new sensors as well.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.440]   So I think it's probably tougher for China
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.320]   to get close to Taiwan than most people would say.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.120]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.520]   Yeah, can you talk more about that?
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.560]   Because every time I read about this,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.000]   people are saying that if China wanted to,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.920]   they could knock out Taiwan's defenses
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.240]   in a short amount of time and take it over.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.360]   But yeah, so can you talk about why that's not possible?
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   - Well, it might be,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   but I think it's just sort of the uncertainty thing.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.440]   But Taiwan, you know, has actually
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   one of the largest defense budgets in the world.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.520]   And they've recently been upping it.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.200]   I think they spend like, I don't know,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.480]   25 billion a year and they added like an extra 5 billion.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.640]   They've been buying a lot of anti-ship missiles,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.800]   a lot of air defense missiles,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.080]   stuff that like, you know, Ukraine could only dream of.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.720]   I think Ukraine's military budget was like 2 billion.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.880]   And they have, you know, professional army.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.520]   They're gearing, and then the other thing is,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.360]   they're an island.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.240]   So, you know, like Russia could just like
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   roll over the land border into Ukraine.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.960]   But, you know, I mean, almost,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.800]   there's just very few successful
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.320]   amphibious landings in history.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.040]   Like some of the most recent ones were all, you know,
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.400]   the Americans in World War II in Korea.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.160]   So like the challenge there is just, you know,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.680]   it's kind of on China to like execute perfectly and do that.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.280]   And so if they like had perfect execution, then possibly.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.040]   But, you know, if like maybe their air defenses
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   on their ships aren't quite as good
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.720]   as we think they could possibly be,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.840]   then they could also end up with half their fleet
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.520]   underwater within, you know, 10 hours.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.640]   - Hmm, interesting.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.280]   And how has your view of Taiwan's defensive capabilities,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.800]   like how has the Ukraine conflict updated
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.160]   your opinion of what might happen?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   - I didn't really know how much about it.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.720]   And then, you know, I like started looking at
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.960]   like Wikipedia and stuff
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.360]   and like all this stuff they're doing.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.720]   And so, you know, Taiwan just has like
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.160]   a lot of modern platforms,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.600]   like F-16s with our anti-ship missiles.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.400]   They actually have a lot of their own,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.000]   they have indigenous fighter bombers,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.640]   indigenous anti-ship missiles,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.240]   because, you know, they're worried
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.840]   we might not always sell them to them.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.920]   They've even recently gotten these long range cruise missiles
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.240]   that could possibly target leadership in Beijing.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.200]   So I think that makes it uncomfortable
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.920]   for, you know, the Chinese leadership.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.760]   Like if you attack them,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.600]   you're gonna have to go live in a bunker.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.840]   So there's lots of like, you know,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.560]   but again, there's, I'm not like
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.440]   the full-time military analyst or something.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   So there's a lot of uncertainty around what I'm saying.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.080]   It's not a given that China's just gonna roll over them.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.920]   - Yeah, that's comforting to hear.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.560]   Let's talk about an area where
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.360]   I have a little bit of a point of contact.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.880]   I thought your blog post about software
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.760]   and the inability of it to increase productivity numbers.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.040]   I thought that was super fascinating.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.320]   So before I ask you questions about it,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.000]   do you wanna lay out the thesis there?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.200]   - Yeah, so the, yeah, if there's one post
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.280]   I kinda like felt like I caught lightning in a bottle on
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.120]   is that one.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.880]   It really like everything I wanted to put in it
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.960]   just like fit together perfectly,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.760]   which is usually not the case.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.880]   But yeah, I think the idea is the world's so complex
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.520]   and we really underestimate that complexity.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.320]   And if you're going to like digitize processes
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.360]   and automate them and stuff,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.360]   you have to capture all that complexity
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.480]   basically at the bit level.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.360]   And that's extremely difficult.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.480]   And then you also have like diminishing returns
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.520]   where like the easily, you know,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   automatable stuff goes first.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.280]   And then it's like increasing corner cases
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.400]   to get to the end.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.000]   So you just have to write like more and more code basically.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.600]   And so that's why we don't see like runaway productivity
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.280]   growth from software is because we're fighting,
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.520]   you know, all this increasing complexity.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   - Yeah, have you heard of the water bed theory
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.640]   of complexity, by the way?
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.200]   - I don't think so.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.080]   - Okay, it's something that comes up in compiler design,
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.400]   but the idea is that there's like a fixed amount
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.600]   of complexity in a system.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.200]   And if you try to reduce it,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.440]   what you'll end up doing is just,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.560]   you'll end up migrating the complexity elsewhere, right?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.880]   So I think an example that's used of this
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.360]   is when they try to program languages
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.960]   that are not type safe, something like Python,
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.880]   you can say, oh, like it's a less complex language,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.480]   but really you've added complexity when, I don't know,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.200]   two different types of numbers are interacting
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.600]   like a float and an int, right?
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.280]   You've added complexity there that, I mean,
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.680]   as your program grows, that complexity exponentially grows
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.360]   of all the things that could go wrong
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.880]   when you're making two things interact
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.120]   that are in a way that you were expecting not to.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.880]   So yeah, the idea is you can just choose
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.160]   where to have your complexity,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.600]   but you can't get rid of that complexity.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.760]   I think there's like this,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.240]   there's kind of like an interesting thing
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.920]   when you start pairing it with management theory
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.640]   and like how it kind of starts tying into some
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.880]   of my other posts is that for a long time,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.440]   when you add up like all the factors,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.640]   the most complex thing when you're doing is,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.560]   is high volume car manufacturing.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.080]   And so we got a lot of innovations
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.200]   and organization from car manufacturers,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.080]   like the assembly line.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.360]   Then you had Sloan at GM, basically,
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.560]   creating the way the modern corporation is run.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.640]   Then you have Toyota production system,
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.920]   but arguably now creating software
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.360]   is actually the most complex thing we do.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.560]   So there's like all these kind of like squishy concepts
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.520]   that underlie like Toyota production system
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.960]   that software has had to learn and like reimagine and adopt.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.680]   You know, you see that with like Agile
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.240]   where we can't have long release times.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.720]   We need to be like releasing every day,
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.840]   which is like, you know, we're limiting inventory there
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.240]   or yeah, there's just, there's like a whole thing,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.400]   especially that's showing up in software
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.240]   that existed in car manufacturing,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.960]   where you're talking about, you know,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.400]   reducing communication.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.680]   So like Jeff Bezos kind of like now famously said,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.320]   you know, I want to reduce communication,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.920]   which is counterintuitive to a lot of people.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.160]   This is like age old and car manufacturing,
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   where you have like Toyota has these cards
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   that go between workstations
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   and they tell you what to do.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.560]   So people normally think of them as limiting inventory,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.000]   but it also tells the worker
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.480]   exactly what they're supposed to be doing
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.720]   at what pace, at what time.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.240]   And the assembly line is like that too.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   You just like know what to do
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.040]   because you're standing there and there's a part here
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.400]   and it needs to go on there
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   and it comes by at like the pace you're supposed to work at.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.080]   And there's, it's like so extreme that there's this,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.360]   I think it's a famous paper,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   but it's by like List, Syverson and Levitt.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.040]   And they went to a car factory and like, you know,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.120]   studied how like the defects propagated in cars and stuff.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.320]   And once like a car factory gets up and running,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.840]   like it doesn't matter what workers you put in there.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.000]   Like if workers are sick or you get new workers,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.960]   like the defect rate is the same.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.080]   So like everything is just like all the knowledge
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.520]   is built into the manufacturing line.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.680]   And there's like these concepts around like idiot proofing
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   and everything like that,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.720]   that are very similar to like what you'll see
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.520]   you had Uncle Bob on there.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.720]   So Uncle Bob, you know, says like only put one input
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.080]   into a function and stuff like that
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.320]   because you'll mix them up otherwise.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.660]   So it's kind of like this,
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.560]   the Japanese call it like Pokeyoke.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.400]   And it's like, you make it where you can't mess it up.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   And that's another way to like reduce communication.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.000]   And then software, of course you have APIs.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.840]   So I'm really interested in this overall concept
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.560]   of like reducing communication
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.880]   and reducing how much cooperation
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.500]   and like in everything we need to run the economy.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.480]   - Right, right.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.520]   Speaking of the Toyota production system,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.560]   like one thing they do to reduce that defect rate
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.340]   is if there's a problem,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.120]   all the workers in that chain
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.340]   are forced to go to the place where the defect or problem is
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.880]   and fix it before doing anything else.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.840]   And I guess the idea there is
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.240]   this will give them context to understand
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.080]   what the problem was,
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.020]   how to make sure it doesn't happen again,
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.740]   and also prevent a buildup of inventory
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.560]   in a way that like keeps making these defects happen,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.200]   or just keeps accumulating inventory
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.680]   before the place that can fix the defects
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   is able to take care of them.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.080]   - Right, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.200]   - Yeah.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   But you know, I think one interesting thing
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   about software and complexity is,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.400]   I think you said a little bit earlier
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.760]   that software is a place where complexity
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.480]   is the highest in the world right now.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.720]   And one of the interesting things is,
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   yes, that's true,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   but I guess software gives you the choice
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.680]   to interface with the complexity you want to interface with.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.520]   And I guess that's just part of specialization in general.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.320]   But you could say like, for example,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.120]   a machine learning model is like really complex,
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.060]   but ideally you get to a place
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.760]   where that's the only kind of complexity
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.580]   you have to deal with.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.960]   You're not having to deal with the complexity
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.520]   of like, how is this program compiled?
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.400]   Like, how are the libraries that I'm using?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.440]   How are they built?
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.360]   You can like fine tune and work on the complexity
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.440]   you need to work on.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.360]   It's similar with like app development, right?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.520]   Bernd Hobart has this blog post about Stripe as solid state.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.080]   I forget the exact title of the blog post,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.480]   but the basic idea is that Stripe hides all the complexity
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.680]   of the financial system.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.800]   It charges a higher fee,
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.400]   but you can just kind of treat it as an abstraction
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.280]   of a tithe you have to pay.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   And it'll just take care of that entire process
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   and you can focus on your comparative advantage.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.560]   - Yeah, and it's really actually very similar
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.800]   in like car manufacturing and Toyota production system
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.760]   if you really get into it.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.920]   It's very much the same conceptual framework.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.480]   Also, there's like this whole idea,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.000]   like in Toyota projection system,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.840]   everyone works at the same pace,
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.480]   which you kind of talked about.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.720]   But also like your content, your work content is the same.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   Like there's no room for not standardizing
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.440]   like a way you're gonna do things.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.080]   So everyone like gets together and they're like,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.800]   "All right, we're going to this certain part,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.360]   "we're gonna put it together this certain way
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.880]   "at this little micro station.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.240]   "And it's gonna be the same way every time."
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.160]   And that's part of like how they're,
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   you know, reducing the defect rates.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.000]   And then if you, you know,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.240]   like if your assembly process is too long,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.200]   like it's longer than what your like time allotment is
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   to stay in touch with the rest of the process,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.840]   then you just keep breaking it down into smaller pieces.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.320]   And so, you know, each person only has to know
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.960]   like a very small part of it.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.200]   And even like the overall engineering team,
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.880]   you know, has all sorts of strategies like this too.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.440]   There's all, they have all sorts of like tools
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.720]   to like help them break up all these processes
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.320]   into very like small parts and to make it all
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   like hold together.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.760]   It's still very, very hard,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.560]   but it's kind of like a lot of the same ideas
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.040]   is you're taking away like the complexity
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.160]   of making like a $30,000 car or 30,000 part car
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.120]   where everyone's just focusing on their one little part
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.960]   and they don't care how, what someone else is doing.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.520]   - Yeah, but the interesting thing also there is
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.360]   it seemed like there, you need one person
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.960]   who knows how everything fits together
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.080]   because one of the, from what I remember,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.440]   one of the tenets of the Toyota production system
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.640]   was you need to have a global view.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.080]   So I mean, in that book, was it the machine
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.960]   or the other one, the Toyota production system book?
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.680]   But anyways, they were talking about examples
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.640]   where people would try to optimize for local efficiencies.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.880]   I think they especially pointed to like Ford and GM
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.720]   for trying to do this, right?
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.080]   They would try to make machines run all the time.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.280]   And locally you could say that, oh, this machine
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.920]   or oh, this process is super efficient.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.720]   You know, it's always outputting stuff.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.000]   But it ignores how that added inventory
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.320]   or that process had a bad consequence for the whole system.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.880]   And so it's interesting if you look at a company like Tesla
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.720]   that is able to do this really well,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.120]   the interesting thing is that Tesla is run like a monarchy.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.800]   And this one guy has this like total global view
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.840]   of how the entire process is supposed to run,
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.420]   where do you have these inefficiencies.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.840]   You have some great examples of this in the blog post.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.680]   But yeah, I think one of the examples that,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.600]   I think, was it the Toyota production system book?
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.520]   But anyways, this guy goes to this factory and the author,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.920]   and he asks, is this like an efficient factory?
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.400]   And the guy's like, yeah, this is totally efficient.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.400]   There's nothing we can do adopting the Toyota way
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.660]   to make this more efficient.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.320]   And so then he's like, okay, let me look.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.040]   And he finds that in one of the,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.620]   they're like treating steel in some way,
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.680]   but it should only take a couple of seconds.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.080]   And the main process does only take a couple of seconds,
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.960]   but some local manager decided
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.160]   that it would be more efficient to ship their parts out
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.040]   to get the next stage of the process done somewhere else.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.120]   And so this is like locally cheaper,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.480]   but the result is that it takes weeks
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.080]   to get these parts shipped out and get them back.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.560]   And so that means that the actual time
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   that the parts spend getting processed
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.760]   is like 0.1% of the time,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.640]   which makes the whole process as a whole super inefficient.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.520]   So I don't know, it seems like the implication
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.280]   is you need a very like monarchical structure
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.960]   with like one person who has a total view
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.200]   in order to run such a system,
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.560]   or am I getting that wrong?
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.340]   - Not necessarily.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.080]   I mean, you do have to like make sure
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.960]   you're not optimizing locally,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.440]   but I think it's the same.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.280]   You know, you have that same constraint in software,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120]   but I think a lot of times
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.480]   people are just like running over it
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.000]   because processing has been getting so much cheaper.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.300]   You know, like people are expensive.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.280]   So like if you could save development time,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.200]   you know, it just ends up,
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.160]   you know, the trade-offs are different
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.480]   when you're talking about like the tyranny
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.640]   of like physical items and stuff like that.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.400]   You know, the constraints get a little more severe.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   But I think you have like the same overall,
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.200]   you know, you still have to fight local optimization,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.920]   but the level you have to
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.080]   is probably different with physical goods.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.240]   I was thinking about like the smart grid situation
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.500]   from like a software perspective.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.640]   And like, there's this problem where like,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.960]   okay, I'm putting my solar farm here
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.720]   and it's impacting somewhere far away.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.480]   And that's in like creating these
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.360]   like really high upgrade costs, you know,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.480]   that costs two or three times more than my solar farm.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.100]   Well, you know, the obvious thing would be
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.280]   if you're doing software is like,
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.760]   you're like gonna break all these up into smaller sections
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.880]   and then you wouldn't be impacting each other and all that.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.280]   And you could work and focus on your own little thing.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.360]   But the problem with that is if you're gonna like
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   disconnect these areas of the grid,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.880]   so the equipment to do that is extremely expensive.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.960]   You know, like, it's not like I'm just like
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.840]   gonna hit a new tab and open a new file
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.880]   and start writing a new function.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.360]   And not only that, but you still have to like
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.760]   actually coordinate how this equipment is gonna operate.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.080]   So if you just like let the grid flow as it does,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.600]   everyone knows what's gonna happen
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.960]   because they could just calculate the physics.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.720]   So if you start adding in all these checkpoints
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.680]   where humans are doing stuff,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.800]   then you have to like actually interface with the humans
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.640]   and the amount of things that can happen
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.320]   really starts going up.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.840]   And so it's actually a really bad idea
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.520]   to try to cart all this stuff off
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.880]   just because of like the reality of the physical laws
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.560]   and the equipment you need and everything like that.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.400]   - All right, interesting.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.280]   And then I think you have a similar
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.800]   sort of like Coasean argument in your software post
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.160]   about why vertically integrating software is beneficial.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.000]   Do you wanna explain that thesis?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.960]   - Yeah, and I think it's just like, you know,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   it actually gets to what we're talking about here
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.440]   where it allows you to avoid like the local optimization
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.800]   because, you know, a lot of times, right,
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.560]   you're trying to build like a software MVP
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.760]   and you're like tying together like a few services.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.080]   They don't do quite what you need.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.040]   So if you like try to scale that, like it would just break.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.880]   But if you're like gonna take a really complex process
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.320]   like car manufacturing or retail distribution,
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.100]   or, you know, like the home buying process or something,
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.680]   you really have to vertically integrate it
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.800]   to be able to create like a decent end-to-end experience
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.380]   and avoid that, you know, local optimization.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.760]   And, you know, it's just very hard otherwise
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.440]   'cause there's no, you just can't coordinate effectively
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.400]   if you have like 10 different vendors
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.080]   trying to do all the same thing.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.520]   You end up in like just constant like vendor meetings
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.720]   where you're like trying to decide
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.880]   what the specs are or something
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.320]   instead of giving someone the authority
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.560]   or giving a team the authority
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.600]   to just go start building stuff.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.640]   And then, you know, if you look at these companies,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.000]   like they have to implement these decentralized,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.560]   somewhat decentralized processes
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.840]   when they get too complex,
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.460]   but at least they have like control
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.560]   over how they're interfacing with each other.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.200]   You know, like Walmart has the vendors
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.500]   control their own stock, you know,
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.720]   they don't like tell the vendor, we need X parts.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.640]   It's just like, it's on you
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.400]   to make sure your shelf is stocked.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.200]   - Yeah, yeah, so what was really interesting to me
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.520]   about this part of the post was,
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.880]   I don't know, I guess I had this vision of,
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.360]   or I had heard of this vision of where software is heading,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.480]   where everybody will have a software as a service company
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.760]   and they'll all be interfacing with each other
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.280]   in some sort of cycle
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.720]   where they're all just calling each other's APIs.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.240]   And like, yeah, but basically everybody and their mother
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.120]   would have a SaaS company.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.560]   And the implication here was, from your argument was,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.280]   given the necessity of integrating all this complexity
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.360]   vertically in a coherent way,
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.200]   then the winners in software
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.840]   should end up being a few big companies, right?
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.360]   That compete with each other, but still.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.040]   - I think that's especially true
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.200]   when you're like talking about
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.160]   like you're combining bits and atoms.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.280]   Maybe less true for like pure software.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.120]   No, like the physical world is just so much more complex
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.000]   and so the constraints it creates are pretty extreme,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.520]   you know, compared to like,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   you could maybe get away with more of like everyone,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.280]   their mom having an API in like a pure software world.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.360]   - Right, yeah.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.680]   Yeah, I guess you might think that
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.280]   in the other kind of world, even in the physical world,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.960]   given that people really need to focus
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.320]   on their comparative advantage,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.400]   they would just try to outsource
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.520]   the software parts to these APIs.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.320]   But is there any scenario where the learning curve
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.920]   for people who are not in the firm can be fast enough
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.840]   that they can keep up with the complexity?
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.040]   Because, you know, there's huge gains
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.840]   from specialization and competition
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.040]   that go away if this is the world we're forced to live in.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.560]   And then I guess we have a lot of counterexamples.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.640]   I guess we have a lot of examples
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.480]   of what you're talking about.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.440]   Like Apple is, you know, the biggest market cap
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   in the world, right?
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.680]   And famously, they're super vertically integrated.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.560]   And yeah, obviously their thing
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.800]   is combining hardware and software.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   But yeah, is there any world in which you can keep
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.200]   that kind of benefit, but have it be within multiple firms?
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.080]   - This is like a post I've got on my list I wanna write.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.640]   The blockchain application, I'm actually like,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.440]   you know, which excites me personally the most
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.640]   is re-imagining enterprise software.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.800]   Because like the things you're talking about,
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.640]   like hard typing and like APIs,
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.480]   it's just like basically built in
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.640]   to some of these protocols.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:09.240]   So I think it just really has a lot of exciting implications
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.760]   for how much you can decentralize software development.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.560]   And you can, but you know, the thing is,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.000]   you can still do that within the firm.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.640]   So I think I mentioned this as like, you know,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.040]   if the government's going to place like all these like rules
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.800]   on the edge of the firm, like it makes transactions
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.320]   with other firms expensive.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.440]   So if you, internal transactions can be cheaper
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.520]   'cause they're avoiding like the government, you know,
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.600]   reporting and taxes and all that kind of stuff.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.240]   So I think you'd have to think about how these technologies
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.040]   can reduce transaction costs overall
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.280]   and decentralize that.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.520]   But also what are the costs in between firms?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.840]   - Yeah, it's really interesting if there are,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.400]   if the costs are logistic or if they're based
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.720]   on the knowledge that is housed as you were talking about,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.000]   you know, within a factory or something.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   'Cause if it is just, you know, logistical and stuff,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.440]   it's just like you had to report any outside transactions,
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.800]   then yeah, that does imply that a technology
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.280]   like HLA, like blockchain could help.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.160]   But if it's just that, yeah,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.320]   you need to be in the same office.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.160]   And if you're not, then you're going to have a hard time
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.880]   keeping up with what the new requirements for the API are.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.600]   Then maybe it's that, yeah, maybe the inevitability
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.480]   is that you will have these big firms
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.520]   that are able to vertically integrate.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.320]   - Yeah, like for these big firms to survive,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.560]   they have to be like somewhat decentralized within them.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.440]   So I think you have, you're going to the same place
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.240]   as just like, what does it look like?
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.680]   You know, what's our, like, how are we viewing it?
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.440]   What's our perception, you know?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.240]   So even if it's like a giant corporation,
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.960]   it's going to have like very independent business units
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.440]   as opposed to, you know, something like,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.240]   you know, a 1950s corporation.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   - Yeah, Berne Hobart, by the way,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   has this really interesting post that you might enjoy reading
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.800]   while you're writing that post.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.280]   It's like type safe communications.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   And it's about that Bezos thing about how, yeah,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.400]   his strict style for how to communicate
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   and how little to communicate.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.840]   There's many examples in Amazon protocols
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.760]   where you have to, the only way you can like
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.280]   put in this report is in this place,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.200]   you had to give a number.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   You can't just say, this is very likely to say like,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.120]   we project X percent increase or whatever.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.360]   So it has to be percent.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.440]   Or, and you know, there's many other cases
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.560]   where they're strict about like what type definition
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.520]   you can have something have in written reports or something.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.440]   And it has kind of the same consequence
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   that type strict languages have,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.520]   which is that you can keep track of what the value is
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.120]   through the entire chain of the flow of control.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.080]   So.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.600]   - You've got to keep work content standardized.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.760]   - So we've been hinting at the Coasean analysis for this.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.400]   I think we just talked about it indirectly,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.600]   but yeah, for the people who might not know the,
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.120]   yeah, so the Coase has this paper
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   called the theory of firms,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.560]   and he's trying to explain why is the case
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.640]   that we have firms at all?
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.440]   Like, why not just have everybody compete
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.480]   in the open market for employment, for anything?
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.280]   Like, why do we have jobs?
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.080]   Why not just have, you can just like hire a secretary
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.360]   by the day or something.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.720]   And the conclusion he comes to is that if you,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.520]   by having a firm, you're reducing the transaction costs.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.240]   So, you know, people will have the same knowledge
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.480]   about like what needs to get done.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.680]   You're obviously reducing the transaction cost
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.600]   of like the contracting, finding labor, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.160]   And so the conclusion he comes to is
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.360]   the more the transaction costs are reduced
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.880]   within people in a firm as compared to the transaction cost
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.600]   between different firms, the bigger firms will get.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.320]   And yeah, so I guess you're,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.880]   that's why the implication of your argument
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.120]   was that there should be bigger tech firms, right?
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.440]   - Yes, yes, definitely.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.640]   'Cause they can basically decrease the transaction costs
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.200]   faster within, and then even at the limit,
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.840]   you know, if you have large transaction costs
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.080]   outside the firm, between other firms
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.240]   that are artificially imposed,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.800]   then it will make firms bigger.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.280]   - And then, so what does the world look like
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.120]   in that scenario?
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.800]   So will we just be like these Japanese companies,
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.720]   these huge conglomerates who are just,
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.600]   you rise through the ranks from the age of 20 until you die?
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.120]   Or is that what software will turn into?
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.560]   - You know, it could be.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.360]   I mean, I think it will be lots of very large companies
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.480]   unless, you know, there's some kind of change
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.520]   in our firm transaction costs.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.920]   And again, that could possibly come from
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.240]   blockchain-like technology,
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.120]   but you probably also need, you know,
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   better regulation to make that cheaper.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.800]   And then you would have smaller firms.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.320]   But again, I'm not, you know, in the end,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.160]   it doesn't really matter.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.480]   Like, you'd be like working in like your little unit
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.840]   of the big bank of corporate or whatever.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.360]   So it may not, I don't know what that would look like,
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.120]   you know, like as like a personal level, but.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.960]   Okay, so speaking of these Japanese companies,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   let's talk about car manufacturing
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.120]   and everything involved there.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.600]   Yeah, so we kind of hinted at a few elements
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.160]   of the Toyota Way and Lean production earlier,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   but do you kind of want to give a brief overview
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.600]   of what that is so we can compare it
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.040]   to potentially other systems?
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.560]   - You know, I think like all these kind of like
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.160]   lean Toyota process-like systems,
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.640]   they do have a lot of similarities and, you know,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.400]   mostly you want to even out your production.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.640]   So you're producing very consistently
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.000]   and you want to, you know, break it into small steps.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.360]   You want to limit the amount of inventory
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.360]   you have in your system so that there's...
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.600]   And when you do this, it makes it easy to
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.920]   see like how the process is running and limit defects.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.200]   And, you know, the ultimate is, you know,
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.600]   you're really trying to reduce defects
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.120]   'cause they're very expensive.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.240]   That's maybe, it's a little bit hard to summarize.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.800]   I think that's my best shot out of there,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.080]   quickly off the top of my head.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.720]   - Yeah, the interesting thing about the Toyota system,
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.680]   so at least when the machine was released,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.600]   they talk about, that book was released, I think, in the '90s
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.640]   and they went to like the history of Toyota
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.680]   and one of the interesting things they talked about was,
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.320]   there was a brief time where the company ran,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.240]   I think it was, was this after World War II?
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.520]   But anyways, you know, the company ran into some troubles,
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.120]   they needed to reduce, they needed to lay off people
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.600]   to not go bankrupt.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.760]   They had much more debt on books than they had assets.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.640]   And so yeah, they wanted to lay off people,
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   but obviously the people were not happy about this
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.200]   so there were like violent protests about this.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:06.040]   And in fact, I think the U.S. written constitution
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.080]   gave strong protections to labor that they hadn't had before
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.720]   so which made it, which gave labor a stronger hand here.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.560]   And so anyway, so the Toyota comes to this agreement
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.640]   with the unions that they'd be allowed
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.400]   to do this like one-time layoff
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.120]   to get the company on the right track,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.760]   but afterwards, they could never lay somebody off.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.000]   And then so the, which would mean
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.480]   that like a person works at Toyota,
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.600]   works there from the time they graduate college
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.840]   or high school till they die, right?
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.960]   And I don't know, like that's super intense in a culture,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.920]   I mean, in software where you have average tenure
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.040]   at a company is like one year, the difference is so much.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.640]   And there's like so many potential benefits here,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.040]   I guess a lot of drawbacks too.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.000]   But one is, obviously if you're talking
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.520]   in a time scale of 50 years rather than one year,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.240]   the incentives are way more aligned
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.640]   between the company and the person
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.320]   'cause like anything you could do in like one year
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.240]   is not gonna have a huge impact on your stock options
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.400]   in that amount of time.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.600]   But if you're planning on,
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.680]   if this company is your retirement plan,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.000]   then you have a much stronger incentive
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.920]   to make sure that things at this company run well,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.160]   which means, yeah, you're probably optimizing
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.560]   for the company's long-term cashflow yourself.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.880]   And also, yeah, there's obviously benefits
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.560]   to having that knowledge build up in the firm
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.480]   from people who have been there for a long time.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.880]   But yeah, that was an interesting difference,
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.040]   one of the interesting differences, at least.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.840]   - I mean, I think there's like a diminishing returns
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.240]   to how long your tenure is gonna be.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.560]   Like, maybe one year is too short,
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.080]   but there's a certain extent to where if like you grow faster
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.840]   than your role at the company, then it's time to switch.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.280]   And maybe that's like, it's gonna depend on the person,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.160]   but maybe like five years is a good number.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.400]   And so if you're not getting promoted within the firm,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.880]   then your human capital is being wasted,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.000]   'cause you could go somewhere else
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.440]   and have more responsibility and perform better for them.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.600]   And another interesting thing about like that story
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.200]   is almost all lean turnarounds,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.080]   you know, like where we're gonna implement
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.680]   something like Toyota Production System,
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.760]   they come with no layoff promises.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.400]   Because, you know, if you're gonna increase productivity,
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.520]   that's why everyone's like, oh, gosh,
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.360]   I'm gonna get laid off.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.720]   But instead you just, you have to increase output
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   and take more market share, what you do.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:34.120]   - It's like, it's kind of like burning your bridges, right?
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.920]   So you, this is the only way.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.400]   - You really, like the process really requires
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.320]   like complete buy-in, 'cause a lot of your ideas
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.000]   for how you're gonna standardize work content
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.240]   come from your line workers,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.920]   'cause that's what they're doing every day.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.800]   So you can't, if you don't have their buy-in,
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.840]   then it's gonna fail.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.640]   So that's why it's really necessary
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.280]   to have those kind of clauses.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.640]   - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.280]   Was it in your post or in the book
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.160]   where they talked about, no, I think it was in your post
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.600]   where you said if somebody makes their process
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.280]   more efficient and therefore they are getting
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.040]   like more work allotted to them,
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   then obviously they're gonna stop doing that, right?
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.840]   So, which means that, I don't know,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.560]   do you have to give more downtime
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.760]   to your best workers or something?
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.960]   Or the people who are most creative in your company?
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.920]   - I was just gonna say, like, you know,
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.440]   if you're like a worker at a plant,
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.840]   then usually they have like small,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.480]   a lot of times like for that level employee,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.360]   like actually small rewards work pretty well.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.240]   Like a lot of people used to like on drilling rigs
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.200]   used to like, if you met certain targets,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.120]   like give the guys like $100 Walmart gift cards.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.800]   So sometimes like small to reward, you know,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.200]   new ideas, stuff like that works.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.160]   But because the whole system has to row together,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.400]   like if you just improve like one part of the process,
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.960]   it doesn't, it may not help you.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.320]   You know, you have to be like improving
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.480]   all the right process and stuff.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.760]   So normally it's much more collaborative.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.360]   Like there's some engineer that's looking at it
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.560]   and like, all right, this is where we're struggling
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.280]   or we have our defects here.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.440]   Then you go get together with like, you know,
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.600]   that supervisor and the workers in that area.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.560]   Then, you know, you all figure out like
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.000]   what improvements could be together.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.280]   'Cause usually the people already know.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.240]   Like this is like, you know, you see a problem at the top
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.480]   and you're just now realizing it.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.920]   And then you go talk to the people doing the work.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.600]   And they're like, oh yeah, I tried to tell you about that
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.800]   like two weeks ago, man.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.360]   And then you figure out, you know,
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.520]   a better process from there.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.880]   - Based on your recommendation
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.240]   and Stephen Molina's recommendation,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.640]   I recently read "The Goal" and after reading the book,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.400]   I'm much more understanding of the value
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.720]   that consultants bring to companies potentially.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.280]   Because before you could think,
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.200]   what is a 21 year old who just graduated college?
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.360]   What do they know about manufacturing?
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.040]   Like, what are they gonna tell this plant
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.720]   that they didn't already know?
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.680]   How could they possibly be adding value?
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.800]   And afterwards, it occurred to me that
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.720]   there's so many abstract concepts that are necessary
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.760]   to understand in order to, you know,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.360]   like to be able to increase your throughput.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.120]   And so now I guess I can see how like
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.120]   somebody who's generically smart,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.480]   but doesn't have that much industry knowledge
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.680]   might be able to contribute to a plan.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.080]   Like, what value consultants could be bringing?
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   - I think there's like, you know,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.880]   this applies to consultants or like young engineers.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   Like a lot of times you put young engineers,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.600]   like just right in the thick of it.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   Like, you know, like working in production or process,
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.360]   like right on the line where you're talking to the,
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.280]   you know, workers the most.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.960]   And there's really two advantages.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   There's several advantages to that.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.480]   One, the engineer learns faster
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.040]   'cause they're like actually seeing the real process.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.360]   And the other is there's like easy opportunities
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.360]   for them to still have a positive impact on the business
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.120]   because there's just like $100 bills laying on the ground
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.760]   just from going up and talking to your workers
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.280]   and learning about stuff and figuring out problems
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.880]   they might be having and things like that,
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.600]   that could help you lower costs.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.360]   I think there's a lot of consultants that, you know,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.760]   I don't know how the industry goes,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.720]   but I would guess there's like, you know,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.360]   I know Accenture has like 600,000 employees
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.480]   or something like, or maybe, I don't know if that many,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.880]   but it's just a large number
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.920]   and a lot are doing more basic tasks.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.800]   And then, you know, there are some people
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.200]   that are doing like the high, more high level stuff.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.160]   There's probably a lot less.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.560]   - Yeah, yeah, there was a quote from one of those books
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.000]   that said, "At Toyota, we don't consider you an engineer
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.360]   "unless you need to wash your hands
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.000]   "before you can have lunch."
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.000]   Okay, so in your book about, oh, sorry, not your book,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.760]   in your blog post about the car manufacturing,
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.560]   you talk about the Tesla.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.000]   And then, you know what was really interesting
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.640]   is that in a footnote, I think you mentioned
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.960]   that you bought Tesla stocks in 2014,
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.200]   which also might be interesting to talk about again
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.680]   when we go to the market and alpha part.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.600]   But anyways, yeah, so, okay, so,
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   and then you talk about Tesla
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.480]   using something called metal manufacturing.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.320]   So if you wanna, first of all,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.520]   like how did you know in 2014 that Tesla was headed here?
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.360]   And then, yeah, what is metal manufacturing
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:14.200]   and how does it differ from the Toyota production system?
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.600]   - Yeah, so, yeah, I just like was goofing around
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.440]   and made that up.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.240]   Someone actually emailed me and they were like,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.000]   "Hey, like, what is this metal manufacturing?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.160]   "I wanna learn more about this."
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.160]   And it's like, well, sorry, I just kinda like made that up.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.720]   They thought it sounded funny.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.520]   But yeah, I think it's really the idea
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   that there's this guy, Deming, yeah, W Edwards Deming.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.320]   And he like had a lot of, found a lot of the same ideas
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.080]   that Toyota ended up implementing.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.520]   And like they, you know, Toyota, you know,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.040]   respected his ideas a lot.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.560]   And America never really,
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.040]   except for the software industry recently,
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.720]   never really like got fully on board with us
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.800]   in manufacturing.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.520]   And so this new, and of course it's like software people
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   that are, you know, coming and implementing this
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.360]   and manufacturing.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.200]   And it's like the real American way of doing things.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.480]   'Cause when you look at like these manufacturing processes,
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.920]   like the best place to save money and optimize
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.840]   is like before you ever build the process or the plant.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.320]   It's very early on.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.440]   And so I think if there's like a criticism of Toyota
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.280]   is that they're optimizing too late
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.440]   and they're not like creative enough
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.840]   in their production technology and stuff.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.240]   They're very conservative.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.640]   And like, you know, that's why they have, you know,
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.320]   hydrogen cars and not battery cars,
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.160]   even though they came out with the Prius,
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.400]   which was like the first, you know, large sales hybrid.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.080]   So, yeah, I think this whole,
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.480]   like what Tesla's doing with
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.720]   really just making Deming's ideas our own
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.080]   and really just like Americanizing it with like this,
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.040]   you know, like, oh, well we want to cast this
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:56.920]   because that'd be easier.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.360]   Well, we can't because we don't have an alloy.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.080]   Well, we'll invent the alloy.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.040]   You know, I love it.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.880]   It's great.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.240]   I just like Tesla because they do such,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.720]   like I agree with their like engineering principles
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.160]   and stuff like that.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   And so I didn't know that their company
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.480]   would come to be so valuable.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.840]   It's just like, I was just always reading their
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   stock reports and stuff.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.360]   I'm like, well, I at least need to buy some stock
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.160]   so that I, you know, have a justification
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.720]   for spending all this time reading their 10 Ks and stuff.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.840]   - I want to get a little bit more in detail
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.480]   in the exact difference here.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.640]   So, so lean production, I guess is, yeah,
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.360]   they're able to produce their cars without defects
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.880]   and without, you know, matching demand or whatever.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.320]   And then, so, but what is it about their system
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.520]   that prevents them from making the kinds of innovations
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.280]   that Tesla is able to make?
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.320]   - It's just, it's just too, too incremental.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.280]   It's like, it's so hard to get these processes working.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.000]   So the faster you change things, like it's,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.640]   it becomes very, very difficult
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.160]   to like change the whole system.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.320]   So one of the, one of the advantages Tesla has is,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.640]   well, if you're making electric cars,
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.320]   like you have just a lot less parts.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.840]   So that makes it easier.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.880]   And then also they're like, you know,
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.120]   once you start like doing the really hard work
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.000]   of basically like digitizing, you know,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.240]   like it's not like, you know,
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.160]   they don't have speed limit dials.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.520]   You start just removing parts from this, from the thing.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.160]   And you can actually then start increasing
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.640]   your rate of change even faster.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.680]   And it makes it hard to get behind, you know,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.320]   if you have these like old dinosaur processes.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.680]   But some, I think there's someone,
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.840]   there's like a YouTube channel called The Limiting Factor.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.040]   And he actually went into like the,
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.280]   the detailed like numbers on what it costs
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.520]   for Tesla to do their giga casting,
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.880]   which saves like tons of parts and deletes like,
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.680]   you know, zillions of thousands of robots
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   from their process.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.120]   And if you already have like an existing stamping line
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.800]   and all that, where you're just changing the dyes
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.080]   based on your model, then like,
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.840]   it doesn't make sense to switch to the casting.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.800]   But if you're building new factories like Tesla is,
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.160]   well, then it makes sense to do the casting
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.400]   and you can build new factories very cheaply
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.080]   and comparatively and much easier.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.240]   So there's a little bit of like, you know,
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.560]   they have lots of, they just have lots of like
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.520]   technical data, I guess you could say in a software sense.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.920]   - Yeah, that's super interesting.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.680]   The analogy is actually quite,
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.560]   it's like what Microsoft has probably
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.680]   tens of thousands of software engineers
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.840]   who are just basically servicing it's technical debt
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.240]   and making sure that the old system is run properly.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.680]   Whereas a new company like Tesla
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.760]   doesn't have to deal with that.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.240]   The thing that's super interesting about Tesla is like,
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.880]   it's, what is, Tesla's market cap
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.320]   is like way over a trillion, right?
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.280]   And then Toyota's is like 300 billion.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.080]   And Tesla is such a new company.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.920]   It's like the fact that you have this Toyota,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.400]   which is like legendary for its production capacity.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.600]   And it's a production system rather.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.720]   And you'd like this, this is like company
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.040]   that's like less than two decades old.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.600]   This like worth many times more is, it's kind of funny.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.640]   - Yeah, I would say that in that measure,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.640]   I don't like market cap.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.080]   You need to use enterprise value.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.920]   And when you start, these old car companies
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.240]   have so much debt that if you look at enterprise value,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.080]   it's not so jarring.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.800]   Like literally, you know, like, I don't know.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.360]   I can't remember what like GM's worth,
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.160]   like 40 billion or something.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.640]   And then they have like $120 billion in debt.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.320]   It's like, so their enterprise value
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:33.320]   is like five times more than their market cap.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.080]   - What is enterprise value?
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.680]   - Enterprise value is basically like,
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.480]   what is the value of the actual company
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.240]   before like you have any claims on it?
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.440]   It's the market cap plus your debt.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.840]   Simple, the most simple.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.440]   But basically, you know, if you're the equity holder,
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.760]   like in the company gets sold,
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.080]   like you have to pay the debt first.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   So you only get the value of what's left over after the debt.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.040]   So that's why market cap is,
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.520]   when Tesla has very little debt and a lot of market cap,
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.240]   and then these other guys have a lot of debt
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.640]   with less market cap, it skews the comparison.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.880]   - Yeah, and then, I mean, one of the interesting things,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.760]   it's similar to your post on software,
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.640]   is that, yeah, it seems like one of the interesting themes
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.920]   across your work is automating processes
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.520]   often leads to decreased eventual throughput
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.200]   because you're probably adding capacity in a place
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.240]   that you're just adding excess capacity
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.120]   and you're also making the money-making part
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.520]   of your operation less efficient
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.520]   by having to interface with this automated part.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.000]   And it sounds like there's a similar story there
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.080]   with car manufacturing, right?
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.680]   - Yeah, I think if we tie it back
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.120]   into like what we were talking about earlier,
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.280]   automation promotes local optimization
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.360]   and premature optimization.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.200]   So a lot of times it's better to figure out,
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.840]   instead of automating a process
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.560]   to make a really hard-to-make part,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.120]   you should just figure out how to make that part easy to make
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.040]   and then after you do that,
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.240]   then it may not even make sense to automate it anymore
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.560]   or get rid of it altogether,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.480]   then you just delete all those robots, so.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.240]   - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.600]   Okay, so let's talk about your,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   let's talk about the project that you're working on right now
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.960]   the CO2 electrolysis.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.680]   Do you wanna explain what this is
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.040]   and like what your current approach is,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.200]   how, what is going on here?
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.680]   - Yeah, so I think just overall,
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.440]   like electro fuels right now are like super underrated
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.480]   because you're about to get hopefully
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.960]   some very cheap electricity from like solar
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.680]   or it could be maybe some wind,
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.280]   possibly even if we get really lucky,
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.360]   some nuclear geothermal
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.320]   and it will make sense to make like liquid fuels
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.400]   or natural gas or something
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.280]   just from electricity and air essentially.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.120]   So there's many,
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.520]   there's like a whole spectrum of ways to do this.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.520]   So CO2 electrolysis is one of those
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.680]   and what, you know, it's basically you take water,
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:14.040]   electricity and CO2 and a catalyst
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.360]   and then you make more complex molecules
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   like carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or formic acid
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.840]   or ethylene or ethanol or methane or methane.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.080]   Those are all options.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.760]   But it's important to point out that right now,
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.800]   I think if you added up all the CO2 electrolyters
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.840]   in the world that you'd be measuring their output
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.080]   in kilograms per day.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.840]   And of course, like the products I just mentioned,
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.480]   we make millions of tons per day.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.840]   So there's like a massive scale up
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.520]   if it's gonna have a wider impact.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.320]   And so there's some debate.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.320]   I think the debate for the whole electrofuels sector
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.040]   is how much are you gonna do in the electrolyzer?
[00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.160]   So one company that I really like their approach
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.120]   that is different than mine is Terraform Industries
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.520]   and they wanna make methane,
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.720]   which is the main constituent of natural gas,
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.120]   but they're just making hydrogen in their electrolyzer
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.200]   and then they capture the CO2
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   and then put it into a methanation reaction.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.160]   So everything they're doing
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.280]   is like already world-scale basically.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.000]   Like we've had hydrogen electrolyzers,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.560]   power fertilizer plants provide them
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   with the hydrogen they need.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.200]   Methanation happens in like all ammonia plants
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.160]   and several other examples.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.840]   It's well-known, very old.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.960]   And methanation is like hydrogen and CO2
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.360]   combined to make water and methane.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.880]   Yeah, so their approach is like the more conservative,
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.680]   but if you add, if you do more in the electrolyzer,
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.960]   like I'm gonna make the methane actually in the electrolyzer
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.800]   instead of adding this other process,
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.680]   you could potentially have a much simpler process
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.240]   that has less capex and scales downward better.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.440]   Like you don't need traditional chemical engineering,
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.520]   like heavily favor scaling.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.360]   So with the more like terraform processes,
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   they're playing as like absolutely ginormous factories.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.240]   And these can take a long time to build.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.640]   So like one of the things they're doing
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.960]   is they're having to fight like the complexity
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.720]   that creeps into chemical engineering
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.680]   every step of the way.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.160]   Because if they don't,
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.360]   they'll end up with a plant that takes 10 years to build
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.680]   and that's not their goal.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.240]   Like it takes 10 years to build a new refinery
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.800]   because they're so complex.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.520]   So yeah, so that's like kind of where I am.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.440]   I'm like more on the speculative edge
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.880]   and it's not clear yet which products will be favorable
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.560]   for which approaches.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.400]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.120]   And your building is out of your garage, correct?
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:51.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.640]   So that's where like the electrolyzers,
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.920]   everything with electric chemistry
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.200]   is like a flat plate instead of a vessel.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.040]   So it scales down.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.760]   So like I could have a pretty good idea
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.520]   of what my like 100 square centimeter electrolyzer
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.920]   is gonna do if I make it quite a bit bigger.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.440]   I just have to worry about like how my flow
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.960]   might interact in the larger one
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.240]   and you'll make sure the mixing is good.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.800]   But it's pretty straightforward
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.960]   'cause you're just like making your flat plate a larger area.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:25.720]   Whereas the scale is different than scaling
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.960]   a traditional chemical process.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.840]   - I'm curious how cheap energy has to get
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.440]   before this is efficient.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.080]   And if you're turning it into methane
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.520]   or something like that, presumably for fuel,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.160]   is the entire process energy positive
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.880]   or like how cheap would electricity need to get
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.800]   before that's the case?
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.320]   - So yeah, so there's different products
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.120]   and different methods of different crossovers.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.360]   So like Terraform Ministries,
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.640]   they're shooting for like $10 a kilowatt,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.200]   a megawatt hour for electricity.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.680]   But again, their process, it's simpler,
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.280]   a little less efficient than a lot of the other
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.160]   like products are a little like,
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.000]   also have like better premiums,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.120]   like just worth more per time than methane.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.960]   So your crossover happens somewhere
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.200]   in between 10 and $20 a megawatt hour,
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.960]   which is, I mean, that's pretty, right now solar,
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.760]   it's maybe like 25, maybe it's a little higher
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.440]   'cause panel prices have gone up in the last year,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.600]   but I think the expectation is they'll come back down.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.200]   And so getting down to like 15,
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.480]   where you start having crossovers
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.240]   for some of these products like ethanol
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   or ethylene or methanol, it's not science fiction.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.040]   - Yeah, I think in Texas where I live,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.200]   the, that's where it's at, right?
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.680]   The cost of energy is like 20 or something
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.880]   dollars per megawatt hour.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.920]   - Well, not this summer, but recently,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.440]   a lot of times in Texas the wholesale prices
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.360]   are around like 25 to 30.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.480]   - Gotcha.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.760]   Okay, so a lot of the actual details you said
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.640]   about how this works went over my head.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.000]   So what is a flat plate?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.240]   I guess, before you answer that question,
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.760]   can you just generally describe the approach?
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.120]   Like what is it what you're doing
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.920]   to convert CO2 into these other compounds?
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.520]   - Well, yeah, like, so just, I mean,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.480]   it literally just like looks like an electrolyzer.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.720]   You're like, you have two sides, an anode and a cathode,
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.040]   and they're just smushed together like this
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.960]   because the electrical resistance,
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   if you put them far apart, it makes it,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.760]   uses up a lot of energy.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.120]   So you smush them together as close as you can.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   And then you're basically just like trading electrons
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.280]   back and forth.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.960]   On one side, you're turning CO2
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.800]   into a more complex molecule.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.000]   And on the other side, you're taking apart water.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.320]   And so when you take apart the water,
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.920]   you, you know, kind of like balances out the equation,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.360]   balances out your electrons and everything like that.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.400]   I need, I probably need to work on that,
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.800]   on that elevator pitch there, huh?
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.320]   - (laughs) I guess, but the basic idea
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.600]   is you need to put, you need to put like power
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.720]   and to convert CO2 into these other compounds.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.560]   - The inputs are electricity, water, and CO2.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.520]   And the output is usually oxygen
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.640]   and like whatever chemical you're trying to create is,
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   along with some side reactions.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.280]   - And then these, these chemicals you mentioned,
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.320]   I think, ethanol, methane, formic acid,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.960]   are these all just fuels or are they,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.120]   what are the other uses for them?
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120]   - So the idea, a lot of people are taking
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.920]   like a hybrid approach with carbon monoxide.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   So this would be like 12Co would be,
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.240]   they'd raise a lot of money to do this,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.400]   have like a hundred employees or something.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.400]   You can take that carbon monoxide and make hydrogen
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.480]   and then you have syngas to make liquid fuels.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.840]   So like they want to make all sorts of chemicals,
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.600]   but one of the main volume ones would be like jet fuel.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.920]   Let's see, formic acid is like a,
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.680]   it's like the small, it's the little,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.360]   the small fry of all these.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.720]   It is like a additive in a lot of things,
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.440]   like preserving hay for animals, stuff like that.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.840]   Then ethanol, you know, there's people that want to like,
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.200]   there's like this company that makes ethylene,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.680]   which goes into plastics.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.560]   It makes like polyethylene,
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.320]   which is the most produced plastic.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.560]   Or you can burn it like in your car,
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.160]   although I think ethanol is a terrible vehicle fuel.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.120]   But then you can also just make ethylene straight
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.520]   in the electrolyzer also.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.240]   So there's kind of like a, there's many paths.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.280]   So, you know, which path wins
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.320]   is kind of like an interesting race to see.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.920]   - Yeah, the ability to produce jet fuel
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.120]   is really interesting because
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.800]   in your energy superabundance paper,
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   you talk about, you know, like you would think
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.000]   that even if we can electrify everything in solar
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.880]   and when it becomes super cheap,
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.480]   that's not gonna have an impact on the prices
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.640]   to go to space, for example.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.240]   But I don't know, if a process like this is possible,
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.800]   then it's like some way to,
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.240]   I guess in financial terms, a good thing,
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.920]   like add liquidity and then like turn basically
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   this cheap solar and wind into jet fuel
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.400]   through this indirect process
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.000]   so that like the price to send stuff to space
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.400]   or to, I guess, just, you know,
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.440]   have like cheap plane flights and whatever,
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.480]   all of that goes down as well.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.320]   - It basically sets like a price ceiling
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.000]   on the price of oil, you know,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.840]   and whatever you can produce this for
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.120]   is like the ceiling now,
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.320]   which is like maybe the way I think about it.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.160]   - Yeah, so do you wanna talk a little bit
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.000]   of like how your background led into this project?
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.200]   This is your full-time thing, right?
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.360]   So I don't know if I read about that,
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.520]   but where did you get this idea
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.040]   and like how long have you been pursuing it
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.800]   and, you know, what's the progress and so on?
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.360]   - You know, I've always loved chemical engineering
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.640]   and I love working at the big processing plant
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.360]   'cause it's like kid in a candy store.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.880]   I would just like, you know, if I had extra time,
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.540]   I'd just like walk around and look at the plant.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.280]   So that is so cool.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.800]   But the, like the plant where I worked at,
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.280]   like their uptime was like 99.7%.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.200]   Like it just, so like if you wanted to change anything
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.960]   or do anything new, like it terrified everyone
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.160]   'cause they're like, and you know,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.600]   that's how they like earn their bonuses
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.080]   was like run the plant, you know, 100% uptime all the time.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.480]   So that just wasn't a good fit for me.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.160]   And also like, you know, so I thought a lot,
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.980]   always wanted like my own chemical plant,
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.840]   but you know, it's like billions of dollars to build plants.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.440]   So that is like a pretty big step.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.720]   So I think this new technology, like, you know,
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.840]   there's like a window where you might be able to build
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.880]   like smaller plants, you know,
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   until it optimizes to be, you know, hard to enter again.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.520]   - Oh, and then while it will become hard to enter again,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.360]   what will happen?
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.800]   - Well, you know, if someone figures out
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.600]   how to build a really cheap electrolyzer
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.480]   and they, you know, just keep it as intellectual property,
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.120]   then, you know, it'd be hard to rediscover that,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.640]   you know, and compete with them.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.240]   - Yeah, and so how long have you been working on this?
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.320]   - About, oh, not quite a year.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.960]   But yeah, I actually got this idea to work on it
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.100]   from writing my blog.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.520]   So when I wrote the heating fuel post,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.240]   I didn't really know much about,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.920]   there's another company in this space, Prometheus Fuels.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.480]   I'm like, oh, this is an interesting idea.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.640]   And then I got talking to a guy named Brian Helgman,
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.360]   and he's like, you should do this,
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.200]   but not like what Prometheus is doing.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.080]   And so then I started looking into it and I liked it.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.160]   So I've been working on it since.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.200]   - Yeah, it's interesting because if energy does become
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.080]   as cheap as you suspect it might,
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.360]   and if this process works,
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.680]   then yeah, this is like a trillion dollar company probably,
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   right, if you're gonna get the patents and everything.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.120]   - Yeah, I mean, maybe.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.800]   There's like, with chemical plants,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.240]   there's like a certain limitation
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.240]   where like your physical limitations,
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.820]   like, you know, like there's only so many places
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.160]   that can have a good,
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.260]   like are good places for chemical plants.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.360]   You start getting hit by like transportation and all that.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.720]   So like, you know, you can't just like produce
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.960]   all the chemical for the entire world in Texas
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.040]   and like transport it all around, it wouldn't work.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.560]   So then you're talking about like a full
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.640]   globe-spanning thing.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.680]   And then at that point, you know,
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.920]   if you're like building factories all over the world,
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.800]   someone's going to, you know,
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.960]   like figure out what your intellectual property is
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.780]   and all that.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.860]   So you would have to like keep innovating, you know,
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:38.400]   to stay ahead of the competitors.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.360]   And I think that would limit your,
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.880]   you know, ultimately it's a commodity.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.000]   So you're making commodities.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.360]   So you don't have the same kind of defensibility
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.240]   that, you know, other sectors do.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.840]   - I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.360]   There's not like network effects, I guess.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.400]   - Yeah, so, yeah.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.120]   So not only like if you try to, you know,
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.600]   so like what, you know, what I was talking about,
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.760]   this is not quite consistent,
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.880]   maybe with what I just said about like harder to enter.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.440]   So you, but I think like what happens
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.880]   is like the scale starts increasing as you go on.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.800]   So there's certain,
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.600]   even though like this is easier to scale down,
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.360]   there's certain elements that are very much hard to scale.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.000]   And then the organization as well.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.360]   So, but you only need a few competitors to,
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.220]   basically you'll end up with like early on,
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.600]   a few competitors that continue to grow
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.800]   against each other and limit the margins.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.000]   And it'd be hard to be like the fifth,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   you know, 30 years down the line.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.360]   - What is the state of this project right now?
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.760]   So are you guys planning on starting a company?
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.600]   And yeah, like what are the milestones
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.720]   you guys are shooting for?
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.120]   - Right now it is just me,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.480]   but, you know, I have like a family of engineers,
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.320]   we're all engineers.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.640]   So it's kind of like, you know, loosely supported
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:01.280]   by right now, but by other people in my family as well,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.680]   they're participating some.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.120]   But yeah, basically I just have to like get,
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.080]   you know, I've already done a lot of the
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.640]   theoretical design work at just like a very cursory level
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.480]   to make sure it makes sense.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.260]   And like, you know, the cost will be reasonable
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.100]   and stuff like that.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.120]   So then I, now it's like working on the electrolyzer
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   to basically meet the targets you need for like reliability
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.720]   and product concentration and energy costs.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.040]   And also then just like, is it manufacturable?
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.680]   Because right now, a lot of electrolyzers,
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.120]   like they're used in the labs,
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.080]   like they're literally smaller than a postage stamp
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.880]   and they're very difficult to make, so.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880]   - Okay, I see.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.760]   And had you started working on this before
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.860]   or after you had quit your job?
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.640]   - Oh yeah, after.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.360]   I quit my job like five years ago or something.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.320]   I was doing like software stuff in between.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.160]   - Oh yeah?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:54.980]   What did you work on?
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.620]   - I worked on several products.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:01.480]   I have one that's like a data service that is,
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.940]   so like oil and gas data service that's somewhat successful.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.400]   Has kept paying customers, but it's still relatively small.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.480]   - Okay, I see.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.800]   And then, yeah, so it seems like your blog
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.640]   is pretty recent, right?
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.480]   Like you started that about a year ago.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.640]   What encouraged you to do that?
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.960]   - Well, let's see.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   I was curious about like cryptography in general,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.320]   but specifically for blockchains.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   And so I wanted to be able to read the Bitcoin white paper
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.360]   and understand some of this like IPFS.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.280]   So I figured the best way to do it was,
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.920]   and I thought, people talk about like,
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.600]   oh yeah, you should write blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.860]   So I did like, oh, I'll create an IPFS blog.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:50.080]   I did that and learned a lot.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.680]   And it was not the most reliable blog
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.300]   when I was like running it on my own droplet and everything.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.240]   So thankfully I like migrated to a service
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.280]   that has much more uptime than my own server.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.000]   Yeah, so then like, you know, I wrote several,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.040]   like I wrote, you know, posts.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.160]   Basically to learn about it,
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.160]   I wrote posts about like hash functions
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.720]   and private key cryptography.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.160]   So then I could understand like the white papers
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.800]   and like actually, you know, what they're doing
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.960]   with the math and everything and the cryptography.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.500]   And eventually like, you know, I had this blog.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.540]   So it's kind of like how spacesuit will travel,
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.500]   how blog will write.
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:33.500]   So my first non-crypto topic was on like building it,
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.900]   how to build a cheaper house or, you know,
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.060]   like it's difficult to reduce like home construction costs.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.340]   And that kind of like, you know,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.620]   like made it on Hacker News and all that.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.020]   It's like, oh, maybe actually people wanna read this stuff.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.460]   So I just kind of been writing since then in my spare time.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.720]   I don't know if, I actually interned for Protocol Labs,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.420]   which is a place that built IPFS.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.520]   - Oh yeah?
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.360]   - And yeah, so I got a chance to learn a lot about it.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.960]   And then yeah, like trying to learn
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.280]   about how Filecoin exactly works.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.120]   That part was the, that threw me into a world for a while.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.240]   But yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.800]   I actually had a blog on IPFS.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.080]   I mean, it was like kind of just a toy thing,
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.160]   not the one that I actually ended up writing on,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.400]   but yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.460]   The thing is, so obviously like at the moment being,
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.100]   it's like nobody else is gonna seed it for you.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.380]   So you have to, you gotta use like a centralized service
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.740]   anyways, like Pinata, but it is a fun exercise.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.940]   - Yeah, I was just like running it off a droplet
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.340]   and on DigitalOcean and that, you know,
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:40.180]   if you use the like direct content hash,
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.580]   it works pretty well,
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:45.100]   even if you're like linking through your ENS name.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.620]   But the problem is of course, like when I was first doing
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.680]   this, like the fees on Ethereum were so high
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.280]   that I didn't wanna change that link all the time.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.320]   So I tried to use the pinning feature with like IPNS
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.040]   and like going through, 'cause you know,
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.360]   Cloudflare does the eth.link and then they look up your,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.040]   you know, whatever your IPNS name is,
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.240]   and then they try to go find it.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.520]   So the part that was breaking for me was like Cloudflare
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   couldn't always find my server using IPNS.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.880]   But if you switch to, so I still have an IP,
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.660]   it's still on IPFS, but if you,
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   like the service I'm using called Fleek,
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:27.020]   they basically go directly to the content hash,
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.460]   but on DNS it's cheap to change,
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.140]   you know, you can change it in one minute.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:35.300]   So if like Ethereum fees got lower,
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.740]   I might switch back to that, but you know,
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.380]   I don't wanna, like eventually, and I think it will be,
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.340]   but you know, if it's like one cent transactions,
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:47.760]   then it'd be no big deal to just change the content hash
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.560]   every time you update your website.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.020]   - What is the reason for having it on Ethereum?
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.920]   - Just for fun?
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:55.960]   - It is inconvenient, I guess,
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.320]   if your content hash is changing
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.360]   every time you update the website,
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.220]   so you gotta keep re-updating the actual,
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.360]   where people can find the site,
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.880]   or use something, some other service to take care of it.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.720]   - I mean, yeah, if transactions are cheap,
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.040]   then you just have like, you know,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.640]   it'd be all, you can automate it all
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.400]   and it just costs you a little bit of money each time
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.020]   and it'd be fine, but you know, it was like $50,
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.780]   so not gonna like pay $50 to post a blog post.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.140]   And then you find that typo, it's like, oh, gosh.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.980]   Can't fix that.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.700]   Okay, yeah, so let's talk about your,
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.180]   you have a paper that you recently released
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.580]   with Eli Dorado on energy superpundence,
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.020]   and you have lots and lots of interesting speculation
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.500]   in there for what might be possible
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.180]   if energy gets a lot cheaper.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.540]   I think we should just jump into it.
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.940]   So, okay, like on the big picture,
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.580]   as I'm sure you're aware,
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.980]   per capita energy use since the 1970s has not gone up.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.740]   Before that, there's this thing called the Henry Adams Curve
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.140]   where per capita energy use would increase 2% a year,
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.860]   and then after 1970, that was no longer the case.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.500]   Ironically enough,
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.980]   right after the Department of Energy was created.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:05.160]   But nonetheless, we've still had economic growth
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.000]   since the 1970s.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.840]   I mean, it's been slower,
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.440]   but even though per capita energy hasn't increased,
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.000]   per capita GDP has increased.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.160]   So is, I think in the paper's abstract
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.480]   or the introduction, you talk about like
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.480]   why increasing energy use is necessary
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.020]   for increasing economic growth.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.680]   But doesn't that pattern suggest
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.120]   that you can still have a decent economic growth
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.680]   without having to use energy,
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.320]   or have you just not come across the constraints yet?
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.520]   - I mean, you just have diminishing returns, you know?
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.760]   Like you can only, there's like physical limits
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.920]   to how efficient things could be,
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.720]   and as you get closer to that efficiency limit,
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.960]   it's harder and harder and takes more and more effort.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.160]   So there's some diminishing returns there,
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.760]   where if you can just like,
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   like so a perfect example of what we were just talking about
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.000]   is oil's quite expensive, and natural gas is expensive too.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.400]   While oil's easy to transport, you know,
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.000]   you can produce it anywhere in the world
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.440]   and get it anywhere else pretty cheaply.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.840]   Natural gas is extremely expensive to transport,
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.640]   but it's very useful fuel.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.800]   And for also like, you know,
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.640]   making fertilizer or anything else.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.080]   So if you just have like, you know, independent energy,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.480]   'cause not everyone has natural gas
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.940]   or the economic capability to extract natural gas
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.880]   using like traditional processes.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.460]   So if you have, can just like build
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.720]   these natural gas factories,
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.560]   where you're just using sunshine and water and air,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.600]   then all of a sudden everyone has access to natural gas,
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.400]   even if you don't have any, you know,
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.840]   you weren't blessed with easily obtainable
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.560]   natural gas reserves.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.520]   And I think that there's really this whole story
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.480]   about like the tyranny of geography here
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.000]   when it comes to energy,
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.080]   is there are some countries
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.980]   that have like extreme electricity use per capita,
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.480]   but it's like Iceland and Norway,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.760]   where they have like crazy amounts of hydropower,
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.440]   and then people build aluminum plants there
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.960]   and stuff like that.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.960]   But, you know, then you have places like in Africa,
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.760]   where they have no coal, very little gas,
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.960]   you know, they're just like energy starved,
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.520]   you know, their transportation system sucks,
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.700]   so you can't transport coal in.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.920]   The hydropower is, there's only so much of it,
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.160]   may not be close to where their cities are.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.960]   So if you start like adding solar to the mix for them,
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.440]   like in some of these other technologies,
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.600]   it could really be an incredible increase
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.560]   in energy availability for them.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.600]   And, you know, they aren't even like meeting the,
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.760]   I think we talked about that in the paper,
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.160]   we're like looking at doubling rich world use,
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.520]   but it would be like more like 10x for,
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.120]   you know, if you live in Africa.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.280]   And then, so I wonder if that's the case,
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.680]   then if energy becomes that abundant,
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.880]   then does the bottleneck in terms
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.080]   of what our civilization needs,
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.920]   will just be the resources that are used to,
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.120]   that are the backbone of the things the energy is doing.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.000]   So I don't know, like the actual resources
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.480]   that are necessary to build the factories
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.120]   and the raw materials,
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.920]   or to what extent can even that be?
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.000]   - I would argue the ultimate limit is like,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.920]   oh, it's really human capital.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.360]   And what a more abundant energy does
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.840]   is it allows you to redeploy human capital away
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.040]   from trying to figure out how to use scarce energy sources
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.840]   into just like, you know,
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.560]   what, you know, you can waste some of it now,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.560]   or like, here's like an example I love about trucking.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:37.840]   So I love trucks, not as big a fan of freight trains,
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.600]   but freight trains are like extremely efficient.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.160]   Like literally they get like,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.880]   you know, they're like, I can't remember,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.120]   it's like 10 times more efficient than a truck or something.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.920]   Like they use just very little fuel,
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.240]   but if you're gonna like, you know,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.160]   the train doesn't come by all the time
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.920]   and like, they may not hold to the schedule.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.680]   You have to aggregate your product
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.520]   with the other stuff or your raw materials.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.160]   And it adds a lot of costs to your production.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.680]   Like, you know, Toyota production system
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.360]   runs on trucks, not trains.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.280]   And for the reason is the truck
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.920]   is just like extremely flexible.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.120]   Like it comes when you need it, it goes when you need it.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:15.960]   And even then, you know,
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.360]   people still complain about truck drivers,
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.160]   but like not showing up when you want them.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.080]   So when you have cheaper energy,
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.880]   you know, like this electrification automation of trucking,
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:32.040]   you are gonna shift a huge amount of goods
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.560]   from trains to trucks.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.480]   And it's going to just have like huge knock-on effects
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.480]   all across the economy.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.440]   It's more specialization.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.280]   You know, you can go, there's a lot of products
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.560]   that, you know, you're just limited on your suppliers
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.720]   because the transportation's expensive.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.400]   It reduces working capital,
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.640]   'cause a lot of times it takes longer on trains.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.880]   Similar stuff like smaller ships, more air freight.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.320]   Like one thing that shocked me is Eli was telling me
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.960]   about like how the elasticity of demand for air freight
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   is just like insane.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.720]   When you even decrease the cost a little bit,
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.480]   demand goes to the roof.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.920]   So I'm pretty sure that there'll be some kind of,
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.800]   like, there's like, you know,
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.280]   you always think like, oh, we can't do this with batteries.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.560]   And then someone comes up with like a more clever idea.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:26.040]   So even if you have like a 500 mile range limit
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.680]   for your freight plane, you know,
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.080]   the freight doesn't care if you have to stop
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.480]   like every 500 miles to refuel or recharge.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.720]   And you can go over land on almost all these routes.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.440]   Like, you know, you could go up through like Japan
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.480]   and the Aleutian Islands,
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.360]   or you could go over land from China to Europe,
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.080]   charge just wherever's convenient.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.560]   And, you know, if that electric plane
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.360]   has half the operating cost of the jet plane,
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.880]   like the amount of freight you're moving on airplanes
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.080]   will go way up and it'll go down, you know, on ships.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.040]   And then everyone will be better off
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.160]   because like right now, if you're a shipping company,
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.640]   you have like real working capital problems
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.800]   'cause your stuff sits on boat for like a month
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.160]   and you've got to finance that and do all this stuff.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.600]   And then, you know, what if things change in the meantime?
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.760]   You know, like, oh, I don't really want that product anymore.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.400]   So the air freight is just like an absolute economic,
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.200]   just like booster.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.000]   So if you could make that cheaper, it's really exciting.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.840]   But it uses way more energy, so.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.280]   - An analogy that had just occurred to me is like,
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.680]   you could imagine that if computational power,
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.640]   if Moore's law had stopped in 2005,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.880]   we would still have a lot of interesting applications
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.240]   using compute and the effects of the computer
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.880]   would still have permeated society.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:53.760]   But obviously a lot of things that are like possible today
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.440]   with computers would just like,
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.480]   they just wouldn't have been tried
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.720]   or been possible in that kind of world.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.240]   - Okay, I mean, all your engineers would be, you know,
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.880]   working on optimization instead of building new products.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.200]   - Yeah, I think in J. Stuart Hall's new book on,
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.400]   we're not putting you at this point,
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.720]   but his book on where's my flying car,
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.120]   one of the points he makes is that GDP growth
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.520]   has been probably overstated
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.320]   because a lot of what constitutes GDP growth
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.840]   has just been increasing the efficiency of existing machines
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.560]   to make them use less energy,
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.240]   which still doesn't result in like more total resources
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.720]   or goods or services being produced.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.720]   But yeah, instead of like making the laundry machine
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.560]   more efficient, you can just like create
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.400]   a new kind of machine that may need to use more energy.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.280]   Yeah, okay, that's interesting.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   Okay, and then so for this vision to come to pass,
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.800]   do you need energy to, is it just enough
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.160]   that energy becomes super cheap or do you need advances
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.280]   in the ability to store that energy as well, right?
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.240]   So if like, if I don't know,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.840]   lithium batteries are the bottleneck,
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.280]   it doesn't matter if you can get energy super cheap,
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.080]   if you can't like put them in, you know,
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.680]   appliances or cars or planes or whatever.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.920]   - I think the important thing to think about here
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.520]   is that our energy is so expensive, especially electricity.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.880]   It's quite with like our energy resources,
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   which are basically thermal, it's quite difficult
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.320]   to make electricity comparatively.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.320]   And so what we use electricity for is like stuff
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.160]   we really wanna use electricity for.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.080]   So like, it's hard to imagine that, you know,
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.840]   we're not gonna turn our air conditioner off,
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.760]   like we're gonna run it.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.120]   And so we're willing to pay a lot of money
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.320]   for that electricity to run our air conditioner.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.240]   Whereas like, if you look at really closely
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.760]   at a lot of the use cases that use like tons
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.520]   of extra energy, they're much more flexible
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.040]   in how they use the energy.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.920]   And there's not a whole lot of storage involved.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:54.640]   Like if you're looking at, you know, growing crops
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   or making methane for rocket fuel or making chemicals,
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:02.680]   like you can design these processes
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.400]   to run when the energy is available.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.760]   And so the batteries are really going to be,
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.800]   for keeping air conditioner on,
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.320]   where you're willing to pay a lot of money.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.520]   So I don't really see the batteries
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.440]   and storage as a limit.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.160]   - Okay, so I guess I didn't, I guess I didn't,
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.280]   like if you have something like air freight, right?
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.280]   If that's the thing we're concerned about,
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.760]   like wouldn't you need some way to store
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.160]   that electricity for air freight?
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.200]   Or maybe you can just convert it to jet fuel.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.720]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.560]   - Yeah, I was thinking more like grid storage,
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.360]   but yeah, like in the transportation,
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.560]   I mean, transportation is gonna dominate battery demand.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.440]   It's gonna be like, like grid storage
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.920]   is like tiny in comparison.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.800]   I think there's like, you're basically getting
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.080]   to the point where we're making batteries out of dirt.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.120]   'Cause that's how you scale it.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.040]   So, you know, if you're making batteries
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.280]   out of like carbon and iron and phosphate,
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.400]   you know, you're just, there's like,
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.360]   it's just how many battery factories you wanna build,
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.960]   you know, and there's plenty of lithium.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.080]   It's just, you have to build the lithium mines.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.120]   I don't really see any hard limits there.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.400]   Eventually, once you build all the factories,
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.960]   then you're pretty much ready to go.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.040]   - And then, so is the point you're making
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.960]   with the alternative batteries that even if they're less,
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.640]   even if they're like worse than lithium batteries,
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.600]   they'll, we'll have just so much energy
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.440]   that it doesn't matter.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.160]   Like, even if we lose a lot of it, that's fine.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.280]   We'll just use whatever we can take.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.400]   Or are you saying that they can,
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.560]   we'll produce batteries with other chemistries
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.800]   that are as good as lithium batteries or better?
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.120]   - You know, right now the shortage is really nickel.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.560]   So like in the very short term,
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.160]   lithium's kind of starting to become a shortage,
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.280]   but it just, there's plenty of lithium and it won't be.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.800]   So like the lithium iron phosphate or like whatever,
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.420]   what there's like a huge amount of substitution
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.000]   into right now because it's avoiding nickel.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.480]   And it's not quite as good as some of the nickel chemistries
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.120]   but for a lot of applications, like it just doesn't matter.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.400]   A lot of cars and everything like that.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.800]   And you're gonna have, you know,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.520]   like the aircraft and stuff playing,
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.720]   paying the premium for the high energy density batteries.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.760]   And eventually there are technologies that,
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.960]   you know, they just use less and less materials
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   because they're just better batteries.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.920]   Like some of these concepts around solid state.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:24.000]   I'm not sure, you know, if those will come to fruition
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.320]   and if they'll be really that much better
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.120]   when they do come.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.320]   But I think, you know, there's lots of opportunities
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.360]   for substitution down the line.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.360]   - What is solid state, by the way?
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.400]   - Right now, all our batteries,
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.280]   the lithium ion, like they charge and discharge
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.200]   through the lithium ion going back and forth
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.680]   between the cathode and the anode
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.600]   and it travels through a liquid.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.720]   And the liquid is electrolyte,
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.160]   which means ions can travel through it.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.280]   So solid electrolytes are a little more challenging,
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.920]   kind of hard.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.560]   So that's why we don't have them.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   So you get rid of the liquid and it's just like
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.880]   the ion has to travel through a solid instead.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.400]   And the promise is like,
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.920]   it could be like a much higher energy density
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.120]   and theoretically cheaper too,
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.960]   just because it's like way less and stuff.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.760]   But there's like all sorts of problems around like,
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.800]   they degrade faster or, you know,
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.880]   batteries have like six different areas
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.240]   that you have to hit the requirements.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.000]   And if you miss one, then it's no good.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.480]   So they're kind of hard to improve in that sense.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.160]   - Yeah, so I guess if the energy superabundance
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.840]   is gonna come from solar and wind,
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.760]   obviously these are intermittent sources of energy.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.640]   In that case, you would need there to be like progress
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.160]   in the battery storage, right?
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.000]   That's contingent on that, right?
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.160]   - Yeah, I think that's what I mean.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.920]   Like a lot of the extra energy uses that we talk about
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.880]   don't really require many batteries, if any batteries at all.
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.480]   I mean, like the transportation, yes,
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.120]   you have like batteries in there.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.400]   But if you're going to like have abundant,
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.800]   like nuclear electricity or abundant geothermal electricity,
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.680]   like you still have to build all those electric vehicles.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.320]   You still need the batteries for that.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:14.040]   So like the extra batteries that solar and wind require
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.840]   over like geothermal,
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.960]   I think it ended up being pretty minimal.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.640]   The way that maybe the way I think about it is,
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.440]   is, you know, if you can have solar farm
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:26.600]   that's gonna give you $10 a megawatt hour electricity,
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.520]   you know, you just have to figure out how to utilize that.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.120]   And if you do, then you'll be very rich, you know,
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.520]   and you'll beat the guy who's paying $40 a megawatt hour
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:42.680]   from the more expensive traditional generators.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.840]   Before we get into which sources of energy
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.760]   are most promising,
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.440]   let's just talk about some of the other applications
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.920]   of an energy superabundance.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.640]   So yes, we talked a little bit about travel,
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:59.720]   but one thing that might be concerning with like air travel,
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.320]   at least for passengers is,
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.320]   if the bottleneck step there is like TSA
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.560]   and other regulations,
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.200]   to what extent will reducing the travel time,
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.760]   or, you know, like, yeah, increasing flight speed
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.040]   or number of flights,
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.400]   to what extent would that have an impact
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.360]   on how much time you had to spend in an airport
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.520]   or in transit?
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.600]   - Well, so right now, if you think about, you know,
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.200]   like Airbus, they have this like super jumbo thing.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.120]   I can't remember what that plane, this number was,
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:32.720]   but like none of the airlines really like loved it
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.120]   because it's too big.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.880]   It's too hard to get like everyone loaded and unloaded,
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.360]   and you really just like hit dis-economies of scale.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.440]   So the electric planes are likely to be just like tiny
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.080]   in comparison, like 10 passengers.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.160]   So that's, it's easier to load and unload
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.840]   and you're gonna fly out of smaller airports.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.400]   So, you know, you won't be going to like
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.720]   this giant regional airport
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.840]   that's just has all the parking problems
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.000]   and all the security.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.640]   You'll be driving to like your neighborhood,
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.600]   a general aviation airport,
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.280]   where there's like a small line to get through.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.040]   And a lot of these small aircraft under certain situations
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.520]   even avoid some of the screening requirements
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.640]   'cause they're just not as dangerous.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.880]   You know, if you only have, if you have a small plane,
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.920]   there's only so much damage you can do with it.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.760]   - I did not know that.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.080]   That's, I gotta start booking planes
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:20.360]   from the small airports or something to avoid the TSA.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.960]   - It's very nascent, but there's like some business models
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:27.880]   that are like coming down from like the NetJet style
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.560]   to like a little more commercial.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.840]   So it's like, kind of like,
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.440]   I think that they're trying to like hit a price point
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.520]   that's similar to first class,
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.680]   but you get to avoid all the airport craziness.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.800]   So I think, and I think I like, I'm just kind of a believer
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.220]   in like, if that existed, people would get angry enough
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.960]   that they would loosen up a lot of the rules.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.160]   It seems like impossible to change those rules now,
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.880]   but I think like the average person,
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.120]   it just costs them like no time
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.760]   'cause most people don't even fly very much, so.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.760]   Yeah, do you wanna talk about what your vision
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.080]   for what a city could look like
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.280]   if energy got a lot cheaper?
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.240]   I mean, in the paper, you have all kinds
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.040]   of interesting projections about drones
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.280]   and electric deliveries and just the entire congestion
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.720]   of the 3D space and I guess with tunnels as well.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.120]   Well, what does a city look like
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.360]   with energy superabundance?
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.200]   - Basically like disaggregate the car to a certain extent
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.960]   where you're using, you know,
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.880]   not like inner city car trips or less
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.560]   because cheap flying is gonna be cheaper
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.840]   and it's gonna be more convenient
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:34.560]   to like have the bots deliver your stuff.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.080]   And, you know, the tunnels, I love the tunnels
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.680]   because, you know, I don't like taking people's land.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.880]   So with tunnels, you can run, you know,
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.280]   new roads and everything without imminent domaining
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.800]   and taking people's land away from them
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.760]   when they don't want to lose their land.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:56.400]   And I think like it's, and that process is so people,
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.640]   it makes people so angry when you take their land
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.200]   that it's very expensive to in that domain people
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.640]   'cause they will fight you, you know,
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.080]   until like literally the sheriff has to show up
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.840]   and haul them away.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.040]   So if you can go around that with tunnels
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.840]   using existing right away, it just makes that
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.480]   like societal cost of doing some of this stuff
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.480]   significantly less expensive.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.920]   And it's, you know, then just the engineering challenge
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.600]   and I think there's really an opportunity now there.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.800]   Like boring company is the famous, but, you know,
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.160]   recently I think there's a Hacker News,
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.160]   another company that wants to do tunnels for electricity
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.760]   and they have like this plasma boring machine concept.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.400]   I mean, it's pretty, it seems pretty crazy right now,
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.200]   but it's just one of those solutions
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.240]   that you're gonna reduce the coordination costs
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.240]   across the whole economy and improve property rights.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.520]   And so people should really try to build it.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.600]   - You mentioned one of these machines
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.640]   in your blog post on tunneling and it was the SpaceX one.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.320]   I forgot the name of it, but yeah,
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.440]   it's like this insane thing.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.200]   It's- - Proofrock?
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:08.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.840]   It's, you know, it's like pretty big,
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.160]   but it's apparently it's all electric,
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.000]   which is kind of insane.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.200]   And yeah, it can just like do it in one.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.840]   How is it getting the material out?
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.200]   Like if you're just doing the tunneling in one step?
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.800]   - The problem that like most of the tunneling
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.160]   is in soft soil and it just,
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.240]   it's really kind of like,
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.000]   it's kind of like difficult to drill through soft soil
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.180]   because of the materials handling.
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.440]   So like when you first start drilling in oil well
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.280]   through this stuff,
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.880]   like you actually have to limit your drilling speed
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.640]   and you don't even have to put any weight on the bit,
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.880]   like just the pumping fluid around
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.720]   basically like jets out the fluid.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.520]   So that's kind of what you're doing
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.200]   with the boring machine and the soft soil stuff.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.520]   So managing the spoils, which is like, you know,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.440]   like they have like muck carts a lot of times.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.680]   I think maybe it's basically trying to do a conveyor belt,
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.160]   but you could also just make it a full liquid
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.000]   and pump it out.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.680]   Like in the oil field, you know,
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:06.680]   we carry our cuttings in mud and we pump it.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.720]   But yeah, and then they have the other big challenge
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.840]   is they have to keep the walls from caving in on them.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:17.120]   So that's like, there's like current boring machines
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.800]   and soft soil spend enormous amount of time
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.400]   erecting these tunnel supports
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.280]   that keep it from collapsing in themselves.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.880]   So it's kind of counterintuitive.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.140]   It's actually dramatically faster to bore in hard rock
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.320]   than it is soft soil.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.160]   'Cause the soft soil, you spend so much time
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.740]   like non-productive time.
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.440]   Where in the hard rock, you're just like blowing and going.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.280]   - Interesting.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.120]   Yeah, okay.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.040]   And then, so to get back to the cities,
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.800]   you mentioned something in the paper.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.720]   Yeah, Mercedes constant,
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.760]   which is the amount of like people's,
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.160]   but wasn't it that the amount of time
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.880]   people spend in transport per day is the same.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.240]   So if you just increase the amount of,
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.000]   increase the speed in which they can move
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.120]   with VTOLs or other kinds of things,
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.680]   then they have a wider surface area
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.560]   in which they can explore, right?
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.400]   - Yeah.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.400]   So yeah, I don't know if like physically
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.900]   the cities will look that much different,
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:18.640]   but like their effective economic size will be much larger
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   because you could live in like Cedar Rapids
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:29.720]   and commute to Minneapolis with some of these technologies.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.360]   So your city in Cedar Rapids still looks the same,
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.280]   but you don't have to work there.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.720]   If you have a better job in Minneapolis,
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.560]   you could commute there three times a week
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.520]   or whatever it is, five days a week.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.180]   It's super interesting.
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:46.320]   Yeah, but does that imply, by the way,
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.040]   that if the commute time stays the same
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.560]   and like people just get more spread out,
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.440]   if energy becomes cheaper,
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.600]   then neighborhoods and cities kind of become
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.560]   this unwalkable mess out of like a Jane Jacobs nightmare,
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.720]   if the conglomeration goes away?
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.480]   - I think it's actually the opposite.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.160]   You know, like if you have tunnels
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.720]   and if you have, you know,
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.480]   some like these alternative methods to cars,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.320]   then you use cars less.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:17.640]   And I think like in many cities, you know,
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.080]   they never made sense for cars anyway,
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.760]   because they were built before cars.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:21.680]   So, you know, in New York City,
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.640]   you're never gonna move everyone around on a car
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.040]   unless you build tunnels, you could then.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.520]   But even then, I think, you know,
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.400]   there's other technologies there that make a lot of sense.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:35.000]   And I think people like walkable.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.920]   So, you know, even though I live in a city
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.040]   that requires a car,
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.880]   like some of the hottest neighborhoods
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.520]   are like walkable neighborhoods
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.680]   where like the neighborhood is walkable itself.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.760]   And then you just like drive your car
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.000]   to wherever else you need.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.680]   But it's like the car is like hidden
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.880]   within the neighborhood.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.960]   - Okay, so interesting.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:58.600]   I guess maybe we'll see more segregation
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.840]   then not in the racial sense or anything,
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.280]   but in the sense that people will prefer to live
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.200]   in like these walkable neighborhoods,
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.120]   but they don't have any problem to like commuting to work
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.680]   using a VTOL or something.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.200]   So then what you'd end up seeing
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.520]   is like these walkable neighborhoods
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.840]   and then like industrial zones
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.520]   that are like way far away distance wise,
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.560]   but not that far away time wise.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.800]   - Right, and it's the same for like,
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.520]   if you wanna live in a small town,
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.360]   that's just happens to be, you know,
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.160]   now it would be too far to commute to a city,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.040]   but you could in the future.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.640]   - Yeah, yeah, more choice I see.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.760]   So what is holding back VTOLs?
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.760]   VTOL, by the way, is vertical takeoff and landing.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:38.880]   This is what, the reason you need to go to the airport
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.360]   is because you need like a large landing pad
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.760]   to take off and land.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.280]   The hope is that if you could just like vertically take off,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.760]   then you would be able to like lift off
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.320]   from your roof or something.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.040]   Obviously, we've had prototypes of this kind of stuff
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.400]   since like the 30s.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.040]   What, like why don't we have these widely available?
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.560]   Is the energy the constraint or is it something else?
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.120]   - Well, I think in the past, you know,
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.840]   theoretically liquid fuels are dense enough,
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.760]   but they're too complex, too expensive,
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.200]   because when you're turning heat energy
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.920]   into mechanical energy,
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.520]   it's just like a lot of weight
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.480]   and complexity comes with that.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.720]   Like some of these old concepts, you know,
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.440]   you have like all these engines and all that.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.760]   And so if you electrify them, it really changes the game.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.080]   And so just now we have, 'cause it's not just batteries,
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.000]   it's the motors, it's the inverters,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.080]   are now getting dense enough and small enough to make sense.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:36.040]   But it takes time to get this stuff through FAA,
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.400]   you know, for better or worse.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.280]   So, you know, it's like the technology hasn't been good
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.560]   enough, long enough to get stuff through FAA.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.840]   And there is some limitations.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.040]   I think right now they wouldn't,
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.960]   a lot of people wouldn't use batteries.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.600]   Like the batteries are just on the edge of good enough.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.760]   Like, you know, you're gonna have like a 50 mile VTOL,
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.640]   not like a couple of hundred mile VTOL.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.480]   But eventually like my like dream VTOL application
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.000]   is like a nuclear powered quadcopter
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.720]   that carries like a container.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.320]   So you can take the container like directly from,
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.840]   you know, the factory in Vietnam or wherever,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.720]   directly to the people who are using it
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.800]   or the warehouse like in Arkansas or whatever.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.240]   - Yeah, yeah, that would be interesting.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.120]   I mean, theoretically you would have like these drones
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.560]   that are carrying like these huge payloads weight wise.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:33.480]   - Yeah, but you wouldn't necessarily want a large payload.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:38.680]   You just want like the, whatever the customer wants,
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.640]   you know, you want to size your vehicle
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.160]   to deliver that payload and that's the most efficient.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.360]   - Oh, I see, right.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.520]   Because you don't need to,
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.440]   it doesn't need to be like a shipping container
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.040]   or like a shipping vessel where you just have it be huge.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.200]   Okay, I see, okay.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.720]   Yeah, yeah, interesting.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.600]   And then what does this mean for computing?
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.680]   So if energy gets a lot cheaper,
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.600]   I guess Bitcoin mining becomes,
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.200]   well, it doesn't necessarily become more profitable
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.800]   because other people's energy cheaper too,
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.520]   but what are the other consequences?
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.200]   Is spinning up an AWS server just become trivial now
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.680]   and then building a deep learning model
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.680]   costs like nothing in terms of GPU time?
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:19.280]   What impact does this have on computing?
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:22.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I think the limitation
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.080]   would probably still be just like chips for a while
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.160]   until you figure out a better production process for that.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.240]   I think it'd be a while before it's like becomes energy.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.760]   I think, you know, like smartphones
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.040]   really worry about energy.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.400]   So there could be some interesting things with smartphones
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.320]   if you have like a very power dense,
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.080]   like beta voltaic battery,
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.400]   it's like a nuclear battery, something like that,
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.720]   where you don't have to worry about
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.920]   like running down your battery.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:53.000]   But outside of smartphones,
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.960]   I'm not sure that energy is like the limit
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.720]   for a lot of this computing.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.760]   - And one of the interesting things
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.280]   to just speculate about at the end of the paper
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.600]   is about a potential carbon shortage.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.000]   And I think in an email to Tyler Cowen,
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.200]   he published on his blog,
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.200]   he, you said like by the end of the century,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.680]   we'll have a carbon shortage because,
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.240]   because presumably because of the process
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.080]   you talked about earlier,
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.720]   the thing you're working on, right?
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.080]   If you can take CO2 out of the atmosphere.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:21.920]   All right, so what is the probability
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.320]   that this ends up happening?
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.720]   Like, do you think it's like more than 50%
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:27.560]   by the end of the century?
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.560]   Or is it just speculation?
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.480]   - I think it's extremely high that it happens
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.360]   and it's harder to put the timeline on it.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.040]   By the end of the century, it might be like a little,
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.880]   if you, I think I ran some numbers in there
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.840]   and like if you 10X current plastic production
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.560]   and then you're just like putting it, landfilling it all,
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.280]   I think it was a little over like a hundred years
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:52.120]   to get by.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.720]   And you're assuming like you're out,
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.400]   the rest of your carbon output is zero in that scenario.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.360]   But it's probably pretty hard to do it
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.760]   like in a hundred and like by the end of the century
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.640]   without a lot of growth,
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.840]   but it's kind of the exponential thing can get you where,
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.560]   you know, like I think all the,
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.760]   you know, some large number of the carbon emissions
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.820]   have happened in the last 20 years.
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:16.360]   Like, and it was very small before like 1950.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.140]   So, you know, you could kind of like get surprised
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.080]   at the back half, the last 10 years, you know,
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.400]   it goes crazy.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.000]   It makes it hard to predict.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.280]   By the way, so in Will McCaskill's new book on long-termism,
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.760]   one of the things he speculates about is
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.360]   if society collapses and we need to restart,
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.880]   one of the things we'll need is coal
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.920]   or some other sort of like dense, easy to use fuel.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.880]   And the problem is we've been burning up
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.120]   easily accessible coal, like coal in places
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.980]   where you could just like dig up and find it.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.760]   And so one of the things he's concerned about
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.520]   is like making sure we leave
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:56.520]   some easily accessible coal silos around
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.560]   so that in case, you know, society collapses,
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.680]   we can restart and use these to power up our,
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.840]   it's like a second industrial revolution.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.520]   I wonder if you could use a process like this
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   with carbon sequestration to actually just build up
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.760]   these kinds of reserves.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.200]   I don't know if like a long-termist
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.080]   or somebody who's like really interested
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.200]   in making sure we have that kind of resource.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.360]   They could just use this process to,
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.840]   is that possible or?
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:24.200]   - Oh, so actually there's a company
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.740]   called like Charm Industrial.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:31.080]   They're basically doing that because they take trees
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.360]   and they do a process called fast pyrolysis.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.680]   It's where you burn biomass without oxygen
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.720]   in an oxygen environment and it makes this bio oil.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.360]   And then they're injecting the bio oil
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.080]   down into wells and selling carbon credits.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.180]   So it's already happening, you could say.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:48.020]   - Oh, wow.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.800]   I knew that that is easy to burn and stuff.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.760]   - Yeah, if you just wanna like burn it for heat,
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.920]   it's okay, but it's hard to refine.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.480]   But this was like a,
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:02.000]   there were a lot of people that tried to do bio oil
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.800]   as an alternative for petroleum like 20 years ago,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.460]   like Cleantech 1.0 and they all failed.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:10.660]   So it makes me laugh that like they're re-imagining
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.780]   the process to sell what are right now
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:14.340]   very expensive carbon credits.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.660]   But you could do something similar.
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:19.500]   There's actually, you could do something similar
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.260]   just to make straight carbon and stuff if you wanted to.
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.100]   - Okay, I see.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:25.360]   The thing that I find interesting about this
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.140]   is often in the case of global problems,
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:33.020]   people will early on identify that a thing
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:34.940]   is going to be a problem,
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.620]   but it often ends up being the case
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:40.220]   that they get the direction of the problem opposite.
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.620]   Like if you think about population, right?
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.420]   In the 70s, people were like correct
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.340]   that global population was gonna be a problem.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.860]   The thing is, it probably, it seems like now
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.060]   the problem is gonna be that the population
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:54.700]   might decline too fast, right?
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.540]   Now that it's gonna grow exponentially.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.860]   And I think this is like another example
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:01.660]   of this kind of thing where CO2
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:03.300]   is gonna be a problem either way.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.060]   It just like, I'm not sure if it's gonna be a problem
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:07.900]   or overproduce it, or we'll have shortages.
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.020]   - Yeah, I mean, if you just think at like the large scale,
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.740]   if you're gonna be like Kardash,
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:16.580]   whatever scale civilization,
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.460]   or you're using like condensed amounts of energy,
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:21.900]   like that's gonna have side effects
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.580]   and you're gonna have to figure out
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:26.260]   how to manage that one way or the other.
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:28.140]   And I mean, one of those is eventually
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:30.900]   earth may just be like a nature preserve
[01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:33.500]   and we all live in space or something, but.
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.660]   Okay, let's talk about nuclear.
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.940]   It seems like you're much less optimistic about nuclear
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:43.460]   than you are about solar and wind.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:47.100]   Do you wanna explain why that's the case?
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.980]   - Yeah, well, especially solar more so than wind.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:51.860]   Wind, I think it's limiting
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:53.380]   because it's transmission problems.
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:58.260]   And again, if you wanna build out huge amounts of wind,
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:01.340]   like some of these zero carbon
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:04.460]   plans call for like,
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:06.140]   you're gonna have to take a lot of people's land
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.940]   to like build transmission lines and stuff.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.780]   And again, really pisses people off and they fight hard
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.500]   and it becomes expensive.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.660]   So, and it's not like the wind turbines
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:20.380]   are relatively easy to site, like 'cause you pay people,
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.100]   you'll actually see like they never put
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.140]   above ground power lines on the people's land
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.140]   where they put the wind turbines.
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.380]   They're always underground.
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:28.780]   So at least they get to the county right away.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.140]   But like when you get these giant transmission lines,
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:34.420]   like, you know, grain belt or something,
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.620]   like they almost inevitably have to go across
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.420]   a lot of people's lands and you can't just stuff them all
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.620]   in county and state right away
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.900]   'cause the pylons are so big.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.260]   - Sorry, what is a pylon?
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.060]   - The pylon is like what holds the wire up, the tall tower.
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:50.620]   So yeah, so solar is like it's much more flexible
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:51.700]   where it can go.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:54.380]   And I think the solar getting cheaper,
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.980]   the obstacles are just like pretty simple.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:59.900]   It's like, well, gosh, it's expensive to build with racking.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.780]   Why don't we just lay the panels on the ground
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.700]   or like, gosh, that's glass we're encasing with
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:06.340]   is getting expensive and we don't need it
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.580]   to last 80 years or 50 years.
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:12.220]   You know, we can just like put some plastic on it instead.
[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:15.020]   Or, you know, we've gotten these, you know,
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.580]   the actual photovoltaic cells so cheap
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:20.380]   and like all the other labor and stuff
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.220]   is getting more expensive.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.340]   Well, why don't we just add another layer
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.180]   and make more energy?
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:25.420]   So those are kind of like your solar solutions
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:28.020]   to get down to like $10 a megawatt hour
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:29.700]   and they're pretty straightforward.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.300]   Whereas like nuclear, it's like,
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:33.500]   well, you know, the light water reactor
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.340]   can't get us there.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.780]   Like let's instead cool our reactor with sodium,
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.740]   which, you know, catches fire when it,
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:43.060]   it explodes when it reacts with water
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.780]   and catches fire when it reacts with air.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:47.660]   Or there's, you know, you could cool it with lead,
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:49.780]   liquid lead, that's an option.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:51.780]   Helium, which, you know, leaks a lot.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:56.540]   Or you could do molten salts that like corrode everything.
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.300]   We don't really have anything that.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.020]   And so I think when you start looking at like,
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:02.820]   you know, this is for large reactors.
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:06.820]   So I think those solutions for very large reactors
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.180]   are pretty hard.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:10.620]   It's pretty difficult.
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:12.540]   And there's a lot of reasons why,
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:15.940]   why do we make these weird choices?
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.260]   Well, there are a lot of stuff just reacts poorly,
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:21.020]   you know, when you expose it to neutrons and stuff.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.140]   So they have, they each have their own features
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.040]   that make them possibly good candidates.
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.820]   So that's really where,
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.500]   and I actually think like regulation
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.940]   is actually kind of like a,
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:34.700]   it's oversold a little bit.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:37.820]   And I think actually to the extent that
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.980]   if people were internally consistent,
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:44.180]   then they would see NRC as a regulatory success story.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:48.180]   Because, and the kind of background on this is my,
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:53.180]   my wife's mom and stepfather are nuclear engineers
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:54.220]   that have like worked, you know,
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.940]   from at all levels of nuclear power industry.
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.820]   So I get to ask them, you know,
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.660]   the general questions and learn a lot about it,
[01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:01.500]   which is nice.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:04.900]   It's very helpful for learning about it.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:08.260]   But there's like back in the eighties,
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.640]   the nuclear power industry was like in real trouble
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:13.900]   because their competitors in coal and natural gas
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.420]   got deregulated.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.060]   Like most of the cost of coal is the rail getting there
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.820]   and the rail industry got deregulated.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:22.740]   And then the natural gas industry got deregulated.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:25.480]   So the cost of their alternatives was falling
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.960]   and they had the cost of, you know,
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.740]   they had to build more safety into their plants
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.460]   because of all these, you know,
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.580]   it wasn't just Three Mile Island,
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:36.140]   it was like Browns Ferry, it was Rancho Jeco.
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.240]   All these like, you know,
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.940]   things that could have been really scary
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:44.060]   and certain extent we got like a little bit lucky
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:48.480]   that we didn't have like a worse disaster.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:52.160]   You know, they were just like relatively limited accidents
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:53.200]   at their sites.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:59.420]   So there's actually a time where nuclear power plants
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.520]   were selling for less than what their fuel was worth
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.360]   they had in their plant, like around there.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.240]   So what the industry did and what NRC did
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:15.240]   is they moved to probabilistic risk assessment,
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:19.440]   which is like, you know, usually the gold standard.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.640]   Like people are really happy
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:23.480]   that we use probabilistic risk assessment
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:26.360]   for commercial crew with NASA and SpaceX
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.920]   and they want FDA to use more probability,
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.420]   you know, more expected value.
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:35.280]   So, and what this allowed was it's basically
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.320]   you're rolling up some of the rules
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:39.120]   and moving into the risk assessment.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:44.300]   So like around 1980, like nuclear power plants
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.160]   only ran about 60% of the time.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.400]   They weren't very reliable.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.000]   They had all sorts of like unplanned outages,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:50.840]   stuff like that.
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.560]   And these, the safest mode of operation
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.880]   is just running as designed.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:59.420]   So the more consistent nuclear power is the safer it is.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:04.000]   So the probabilistic risk assessment allows you
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.160]   to do repairs while you're running,
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:09.640]   which was kind of like discouraged before.
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.360]   So it'll be like, if your main cooling pump
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:16.260]   is leaking before you'd be like, oh gosh,
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.180]   I hope we can make it.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:18.320]   And then eventually it just fails
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.000]   and you shut down the reactor.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.200]   And now it's like, all right, well, we have backups.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.960]   The safest thing to do is actually repair it now
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.480]   while the plant's still running
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.880]   and then get it repaired and put it back online.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.600]   And so the, so not only like to give you the idea
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.880]   of like the safety standards that NRC has,
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:41.840]   think for like the plant taking damage
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.800]   is like one time in 10,000 reactor years.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.140]   And then for a large releases,
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.220]   one in 100,000 reactor years.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:53.020]   And there's 93 operating reactors that,
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.340]   less than 93 sites.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.540]   So like we should only see like a three mile island
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.100]   under the current standards,
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:03.780]   like once every 100 years or so in a large release,
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:06.660]   like a Fukushima type situation,
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.300]   like once every a thousand years.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:12.360]   But they have like just in a few years in the 1970s,
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.940]   like the industry had like three or four
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:17.180]   of these like damage events, at least.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:19.260]   I don't know how many like officially count,
[01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:21.560]   but probably at least three.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.660]   So the safety is like gone, incredible.
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:28.660]   And now the operating capacity is up to like over 90%.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.100]   So the plants are just extremely reliable
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.900]   and it lowers their costs 'cause their costs are so fixed.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:38.940]   And like, can you compare it to like a country like France,
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:40.860]   they've had a lot of reliability problems
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:42.460]   with their nuclear fleet in the last couple of years.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:45.320]   Like this year, their capacity factor,
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.420]   I think I saw it might barely be over 60%.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:51.340]   They have, you know, we have like 90 gigawatts nuclear,
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:53.340]   they have 60 gigawatts.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:56.100]   So that's like makes a huge difference for Europe
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.220]   that those plants aren't running full out.
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:01.820]   And it's really, you see a lot of charts about like,
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:03.520]   if Germany didn't shut down its reactors,
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.420]   what would the energy balance be?
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.340]   But you don't see as many,
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.420]   like if the French could run their reactors
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:11.260]   like American reactors, what would the energy balance be?
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:15.640]   So I think there's, I could go on about like
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.160]   how that integrates into new plants if you want about that.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:18.980]   - Yeah, I do.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:21.400]   Yeah, 'cause the line I've always heard on this
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.800]   for my bubble is like,
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.240]   oh, they haven't approved a new plant.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.080]   The NRC has not approved a new thing since,
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:28.380]   a new plant since it was created.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.560]   I guess they just approved the design
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.120]   for the new small modular reactors,
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.080]   which I guess I would love to hear your opinion on as well.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.920]   But yeah, yeah.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.320]   So I'm very curious to hear this perspective.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.160]   - Well, okay.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:41.500]   So if you think about it, in the 1980s,
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.780]   you had new sources of fuel, you had new competitors.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:48.020]   You also, by the end of the decade,
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:49.260]   you increased the amount
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:50.780]   your nuclear power plants ran by a lot.
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:53.100]   So a lot of these new power plants
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.380]   that people were thinking about building
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:55.600]   were at existing sites,
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.640]   like an extra reactor at Watts Bar or whatever.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.040]   And well, you basically just got like a,
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.940]   buy two, get one free by running your plant better.
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.060]   So you don't really need them as much.
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:10.220]   So all those contributed to like,
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:13.820]   just not making sense to build new nuclear power plants
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:15.820]   because the existing fleet ran better
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:19.360]   and more competitors and electricity demands slowed down.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.160]   So I think there's like a,
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.560]   is it hard to get through NRC approval?
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.540]   Like, yes, that last one,
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.500]   the mini reactor you're talking about took like,
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.300]   I don't know, 10 years or something.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:33.940]   But when you think about like
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:36.140]   a probabilistic risk assessment,
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:38.560]   like no one ever says like,
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:41.900]   well, gosh, NRC's current standards of like a large release,
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:44.060]   which would basically happen one every thousand years.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:46.740]   Like, is that, you know, we're not arguing over that.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:50.060]   We're just like talking past each other, I guess, instead.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:54.680]   So to me, like that's pretty reasonable risk level.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:57.700]   Like, you know, if you're gonna like 10 times your reactors,
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:00.660]   and that means like almost certainly you'd have
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.140]   a Fukushima within your lifetime
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.300]   if you go with NRC standards.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:06.660]   But actually it turns out that it's pretty cheap
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.740]   to like do way better.
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:12.380]   You know, a lot of the reason why the plants weren't built
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.540]   may not necessarily been because of regulation,
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:16.940]   but because like, you know,
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:19.780]   like the market conditions changed.
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.340]   You know, you had more competitors
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:24.060]   and the coal with the gas being deregulated.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:27.500]   And then you also had, you know,
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.100]   increased production from the existing nuclear plants.
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:32.140]   So if you're gonna build an extra nuclear plant
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.260]   and or an extra reactor at an existing site,
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:39.260]   then, you know, you might not have needed to anymore
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.460]   because you got so much more production
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.900]   out of your existing plants.
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:46.140]   And the stuff like they'd shorten the fueling time,
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:49.140]   just a lot of like all around improvements
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:52.380]   paired with electricity demand flattening
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:57.020]   that really made new plants not economic or not necessary.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.220]   And, you know, really when we think
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:04.020]   about the probabilistic risk assessment,
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:09.420]   it just takes a lot of engineering time to get it through.
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.820]   Like if you look at how hard it was for SpaceX
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.380]   to get Falcon 9 and Dragon through NASA's
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:17.260]   loss of crew risk calculations, you know,
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:20.380]   it took years, took hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:24.140]   So it's kind of funny that like people see that as a success
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:27.340]   and especially when the stakes were only like a few lives
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:29.980]   for people that volunteered for danger.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:31.820]   And then you have like a nuclear power plant
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.660]   where we're going through the same
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:36.380]   probabilistic risk assessment.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:39.780]   And, you know, it could impact many more people's lives.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.500]   And, you know, it's like, oh, it's not,
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:43.660]   you know, that's not good enough.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.300]   So, I mean, I think it would make more sense to argue
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:51.220]   about, you know, if the risk factor, you know,
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.700]   how much risk should we take like with the actual numbers
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:55.540]   as opposed to just like, oh, I'm mad
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.780]   that we're not building nuclear power plants.
[01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:02.940]   And actually it becomes just like very inexpensive
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:07.740]   to actually to improve the risk probabilities
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.900]   because the old plants that we're running now,
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:12.980]   they have like active safety systems,
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:16.380]   which means you have to maintain them and they have to work.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.380]   So like, if you want to like move the control rods
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:22.740]   back into the reactor, well, there's like a mechanism
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:24.660]   and a motor that does that, that can fail.
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.420]   So that, you know, when you're calculating your risk,
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:29.260]   you have to calculate, oh gosh, what if this motor fails?
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:30.420]   Or what if my control fails?
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.020]   Or what if I don't have a properly trained operator
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:33.860]   to do it?
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.620]   And it's the same for the cooling systems.
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.100]   But this new generation of plants,
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.580]   they have passive safety systems
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:42.660]   or like natural convection can cool the reactor
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:47.420]   in an emergency or the rods are more like dead man switch
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:49.500]   where, you know, if something happens,
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:51.900]   they just drop in from gravity.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.740]   And so the new power plants like this one
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:54.700]   that just got approved
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:57.220]   or the one they're building down in Georgia,
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.260]   you know, can be orders of magnitude safer
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.140]   than the running plants.
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.220]   And it's not really like a huge cost increase.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:07.740]   You're just changing how you do these things.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:10.940]   And in fact, like if you look at all these,
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.780]   like all the literature for them,
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.540]   they're actually supposed to be less complex
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:15.780]   and easier to build.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.500]   But, you know, you're talking about a project
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.420]   that is so complicated.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:23.580]   It takes thousands of workers years and years to build.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.700]   Working every day.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.900]   And it's like, if you're going to go through
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:30.620]   and do the engineering in great detail
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.180]   to prove that your plan is safe
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.660]   under the probabilistic risk assessment,
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:36.460]   it's gonna take hundreds of thousands of hours
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:37.420]   of engineering time.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:38.740]   I mean, it's gonna take a long time.
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:40.460]   And that's why you see,
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.460]   I mean, investors are willing to pay it at this point.
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:43.780]   It's just like, you know,
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:48.180]   after you build it because of, you know,
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:49.580]   the rank and cycle and all that,
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:52.900]   is it gonna generate economic power?
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:55.620]   And, you know, it's not necessarily going to.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:58.540]   I think one way to think about this is,
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:00.580]   my father-in-law, he always says, you know,
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:01.940]   when people ask him about
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:03.220]   why we're not doing more nuclear,
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.860]   he says, "Well, you gotta think about the politics first
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:07.980]   "and the economics second."
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.100]   And those are like the important ones.
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:12.660]   And so people are submitting designs
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:14.340]   and when to build plants
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.900]   that are big enough to impact lots of people's lives,
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:19.140]   even if that risk is very low.
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:22.220]   You know, some people still are bothered by that.
[02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:26.860]   But also they're selling an easily substitutable commodity
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:28.020]   in most cases.
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:31.860]   And so I think a lot of times on the political side,
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:34.100]   if you can substitute nuclear power, people will,
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:36.180]   even if it's coal or whatever,
[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:37.900]   people don't really care that much about the emissions.
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:41.020]   Like they just care about their electricity turning on.
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:44.220]   And I think you see the opinion change very fast
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:46.500]   when nuclear power is no longer a substitute.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:47.340]   Like all of a sudden, you know,
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:49.460]   Germany's like, "Well, we could turn our reactors back on."
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:50.940]   Or Japan, same way.
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:52.740]   You know, they've had these reactors off for years,
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.100]   but now that there's an energy crunch,
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.300]   they're like, "Well, let's turn them back on."
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:00.820]   So I think the future for nuclear power,
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.140]   which would be a better future,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:07.140]   is you create products that impact less people's lives
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:09.140]   or have the potential to impact less people's lives
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:11.860]   and also are not substitutable.
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:14.100]   And I think that means small reactors.
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:16.420]   Like if you have a battery that can power your phone
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:19.460]   or you have like a little battery out in your garage
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.900]   that can power your house.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:24.500]   The real, you know, these are hard to make.
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:27.340]   There's a lot of problems, especially on power density.
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:29.500]   Like, you know, the nuclear is very energy dense,
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.020]   but not necessarily power dense.
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:35.660]   So you have to do a lot of work on that to get there.
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:38.420]   But one of like the most exciting examples
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:39.820]   of recent nuclear technology
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:42.820]   is these people at some national labs
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:46.020]   and NASA got together and created this Cresti reactor.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:48.020]   And only to, it's like only one kilowatt.
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:49.060]   So it's small.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:51.060]   You know, I think the thing weighs like 400 kilograms.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:52.060]   It fits in the room.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.180]   They got the whole project done in a couple of years
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.180]   for like less than $20 million.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.180]   And it worked great.
[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:01.740]   It's very safe just because, partly because it's so small,
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:03.340]   but it has almost no moving parts.
[02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:05.540]   Like the whole thing is, you know,
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:07.060]   it has like a Stirling engine on top
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:09.460]   and that's like the only moving part.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.900]   So it's really, you know,
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:14.100]   and there are several startups now
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:15.860]   that are working on improving that technology
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:17.620]   and commercializing it.
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:20.100]   So that's the kind of like nuclear stuff that,
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:21.580]   you know, why I talk about small nuclear,
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:24.700]   micro nuclear is really exciting to me
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.420]   because it has so much potential.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:28.740]   And when you start putting nuclear
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.100]   in that small form factor,
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:31.340]   there's no other energy source
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:34.700]   that can compete with it on energy density.
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.540]   So you can do things you could never do before.
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:40.220]   Whereas like selling to the grid in a large power plant
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:43.100]   is like, well, I can do that lots of ways.
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:44.940]   And if you think through this lens,
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:49.500]   then you see like the entire nuclear debate is,
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:52.660]   you know, the nuclear proponents trying to claim
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:54.700]   that nuclear is not substitutable
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:56.380]   and that we should pay more,
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:59.260]   accept the risk or whatever.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:00.380]   And maybe we should,
[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:04.940]   but it makes it hard to promote that technology.
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.140]   If you could have a phone that you never tried to charge,
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:07.980]   like people would love that.
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.420]   They'd be like, I don't care that it's nuclear.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:13.260]   I just have a phone that, you know, never goes dead.
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:16.420]   - I guess the question is to what extent are those,
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:19.500]   is the lengthy and expensive process necessary
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:22.140]   for the probabilistic risk assessment?
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:24.300]   If there's like a way you could just have the process
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:27.020]   not be more streamlined and have the same,
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:31.620]   be as effective in evaluating the harm.
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.340]   And then I guess another thing is,
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:35.780]   if we haven't seen, it's like zero people
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:36.620]   or like very few people
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:39.060]   who have like directly died from nuclear, right?
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:40.780]   So is it just that we've gotten lucky
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.420]   or like you're saying that could have been like way more
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:45.820]   and we're just not lucky timeline?
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:47.340]   - I guess I'll go backwards a little bit here
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.340]   on answering those questions.
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.980]   So more so than I think what people are responding to
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:58.020]   is just because like Fukushima didn't have,
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:00.780]   you know, airborne radiation that was very dangerous,
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:04.340]   but people still got removed from their home, you know,
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.500]   and there's a lot of costs associated with that.
[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:09.180]   And, you know, it's hard for me to believe
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.980]   that if we had a similar thing in the US
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:14.580]   that there wouldn't be, you know,
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:16.340]   some type of mandatory evacuations
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:17.740]   that were really unpleasant.
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:20.940]   And if you could, you know, get your power from coal
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:23.060]   or natural gas without that risk,
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:25.780]   I mean, a lot of people would make that trade off.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:28.900]   And I think the other thing with Fukushima is,
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:31.100]   as I understand it, like they were able,
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.980]   because it was on the ocean with fast currents,
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:35.780]   they were able to use like a lot of seawater
[02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:39.260]   to keep the reactor from getting too out of control,
[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:42.420]   but they were just like dumping, you know,
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:46.580]   a lot of the like radioactive stuff into the ocean,
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:49.180]   but it was dispersing quickly, it wasn't a big deal.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.180]   So, you know, if you're on like a freshwater reservoir,
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:54.860]   like most nuclear, most US power plants are,
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:57.140]   like your risk equation might've been different there.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:00.420]   I don't know enough about it to know if that really matters,
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:02.020]   but I think the main thing is
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:04.700]   because of the precautionary principle,
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:07.820]   people are still gonna get removed from their homes
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.180]   and people don't like that.
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:12.820]   Let's see, I'm making it fat.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:14.540]   I mean, you can always streamline processes,
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.540]   but the thing is like people are submitting designs
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:18.500]   that are extremely complex.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:23.500]   So whether your design is ultra safe or not safe at all
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:27.180]   to do all the engineering to prove that
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:28.660]   costs about the same either way.
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:31.340]   So that's part of why these new plants are so much safer
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:34.780]   than the NRC standards is it's just not that hard
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.820]   to make them that much safer.
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:39.260]   And a lot of your licensing is going to be, you know,
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:41.220]   you're gonna spend the same engineering resources
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.700]   no matter what, based on your plant complexity.
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.780]   So the, you know, that's like the difference
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.060]   why Krusty was able to go through so fast.
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.500]   Well, you know, they went is, you know,
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:52.500]   their thing is very simple.
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:53.860]   It'll have very many moving parts.
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:56.380]   Like there's only so many things that can go wrong with it.
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:58.700]   And so that, I think that's what's exciting to me
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:00.900]   about these other startups is they have the potential
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:05.900]   to get through faster with less money.
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.820]   And then there's real markets in like remote power,
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:12.580]   space, military, where people are willing to pay the premium
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.980]   for these initial models.
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.380]   - Okay, I see.
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:19.940]   Okay, so you're not bearish on nuclear or the future
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:23.340]   given the new designs with passive cooling
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:24.180]   and stuff like that.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:25.300]   It was more like the old designs
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:26.820]   that you're pessimistic about.
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.540]   Is that correct?
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:30.660]   - Yeah, I mean, like if you look at like the,
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.620]   what the cost of electricity is gonna be from that,
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:35.780]   you know, if they ever build the reactors
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:37.940]   that just got proven or just got approved,
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.620]   like it's quite expensive, you know.
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:44.420]   I think usually it's around like 40, $50 a megawatt hour,
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.940]   best case, but more likely it could be up to like $80
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:48.620]   a megawatt hour.
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:51.900]   So, you know, they're not building it, you know,
[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.740]   in deregulated power markets, 'cause you, you know,
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.100]   you lose money.
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:59.580]   But there are places where it could make sense.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:01.340]   You know, some places like in Europe
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:03.460]   have very expensive electricity.
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:04.900]   - And Japan and Singapore,
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.420]   and there's a lot of other places that are.
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.940]   - Yeah, yeah, so there could be some markets in there,
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:11.580]   but, you know, that technology then still has to compete
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:14.580]   with those places building solar panels
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:17.780]   or, you know, all these other technologies
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.440]   that you could do.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:20.940]   And, you know, then there's the whole argument,
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:22.820]   oh, well, nuclear can do this and that.
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:26.820]   But, you know, I think the people building the reactors
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:30.100]   clearly don't want to build them in deregulated power
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:32.260]   markets, because it's not economic.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.340]   You know, that's why I'm excited about the small,
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.780]   because there's alternative markets
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:38.260]   other than selling this substitutable commodity
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.740]   that's very cheap.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:41.980]   - Well, what is, have you talked to Eli about this,
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.820]   or what is his opinion?
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:47.460]   - Yeah, so Eli finds out about these like new startups
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:49.820]   that fit this bill and sends me the information on,
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.900]   'cause he knows I'm excited about it.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:56.700]   So I think he's also, you know, he also, like, of course,
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.020]   you know, his like specialty is like governmental affairs.
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:01.420]   So there's still, I'm sure there's still lots of opportunity
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.500]   to improve the process at NRC.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:07.820]   Like recently, IMPO, which is like the industry group,
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:10.540]   that's very much like a German style industry group.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:11.540]   It's very powerful.
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:15.740]   Their goal with NRC was like reduce the nuclear rules
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:16.860]   by like one third.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:20.180]   And then you also have NRC writing new standards
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:22.780]   for like gen four reactors that's supposed to be done
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:24.780]   in a couple of years, but Congress instructed them to do it.
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:28.540]   So there's lots of opportunity to try to improve the process
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:30.100]   but it's very complex.
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:34.020]   Like I'll give one example, the Browns Ferry accident.
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:36.060]   The main thing that came out of that was
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:40.500]   you can't have control cables for safety systems
[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:43.340]   on redundant safety systems on the same cable tray
[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:44.860]   because that cable tray catches on fire,
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:46.540]   you lose both systems.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:50.420]   So it's very, very expensive to run extra cable trays
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.300]   and all this cable separation.
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.140]   And like, that's actually one of the problems
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:57.660]   that's like delaying Vogel and Georgia right now
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:02.660]   is they had like 500 issues of sharing the same,
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:06.620]   like safety systems sharing the same cable tray.
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:09.460]   So they have to like, you know, build all new cable trays
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:11.940]   and clean out the mess of the stuff they already built
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:14.380]   and redo it, super expensive.
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:17.620]   So NRC is like tried, they tried a pilot program
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:22.620]   where they did like a performance-based safety on, you know,
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:25.220]   as opposed to like just the strict cable separation rule.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.340]   And like, I think Oconee was one of the PowerPoints
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.180]   that tried it, ended up being more expensive
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:31.660]   than just the simple rule.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:35.860]   So the, you know, the reality is often very complex.
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:38.220]   And I think when you have these complex plants,
[02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:40.540]   like it's just hard to do.
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.060]   So it can always be improved, but you know,
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:46.340]   I think the small could end up greatly out-competing
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:50.020]   the large because they have less complexity.
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:52.100]   - Yeah, you had a small section in that piece about fusion
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:55.260]   where you, yeah, you were especially pessimistic
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:56.660]   about fusion.
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:59.780]   Well, what is your take on fusion?
[02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:01.020]   - Oh, no, it's kind of the same thing.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:02.460]   I'm not pessimistic about fusion.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.980]   I'm pessimistic about fusion technologies
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:07.060]   that heat up water to make steam
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:08.820]   and run it through a steam turbine.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.300]   - Because they're not efficient?
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.540]   - It's just so expensive to do the,
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:15.900]   like literally like just putting in like the steam turbine
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:18.900]   and the condenser and all that kind of stuff you need
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:21.180]   for that basically makes you uncompetitive
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.220]   on most deregulated power markets.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.060]   - Yeah, so, I mean, there are startups
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.820]   who have plans to do direct energy conversion.
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:31.300]   I don't know how feasible those plans are,
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:34.100]   but yeah, like presumably you think those are,
[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:38.460]   in those cases, you think fusion could have a big future?
[02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:41.060]   - Yeah, yeah, again, like I don't know too much
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:42.460]   about the same as you.
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:46.420]   I don't know too much about their specific technology,
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:49.420]   but if you're pursuing a direct conversion technology,
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:52.860]   it's just you're, you actually have a chance of success.
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:54.500]   I think a lot of people I've talked to
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.580]   in like the fusion space, they're like,
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:59.780]   well, I can make electricity for $50 a megawatt hour
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:02.060]   and because I'm fusion, people should pay me $50.
[02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:06.140]   And it's like, well, not everyone may want to pay you $50.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:08.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it might've involved
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.340]   an initial period of like large subsidy
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:14.660]   that we had to give electric vehicles and even solar.
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:17.460]   I had like, we had to give huge subsidies to solar
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:18.940]   in the beginning when we were at the beginning
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:19.780]   of the learning curve.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:21.860]   So that might be necessary though.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.820]   - Yeah, I mean, I really disagree
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:26.700]   with like the subsidy solar's had actually.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.060]   And I think it just like,
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.940]   if you actually look at the numbers, it proves the point.
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:33.020]   Like the people say like, oh, because Germany
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:35.980]   didn't feed in tariffs that like made solar cheap.
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:38.900]   So if you had a country that's 1% of the population,
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.700]   they spent like a tiny portion of their GDP
[02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:43.780]   and that was enough to scale the technology.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:45.780]   Well, you should just let some other fool do that,
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:47.740]   you know, reap the benefits.
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:50.580]   So I would be supportive of taking away
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:53.380]   most of the subsidies for energy in general.
[02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:54.500]   - Just to make sure I understood that argument,
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:56.740]   you're saying that like, it's unlikely
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:58.220]   that the small subsidies that Germany gave
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:00.940]   were enough to actually make the difference?
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.260]   - Well, I'm just saying if they were,
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:05.420]   if it took such a small amount of subsidy to do it,
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.420]   like someone will be foolish enough to do that.
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:09.540]   You know, in this case, it was Germany.
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:11.540]   They spent a lot of money doing that.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.820]   That was, you know, they're not reaping the benefit from.
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:16.420]   - Yeah, it's not compatible with their environment.
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:19.380]   So, and their climate, I mean, yeah.
[02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:21.420]   - So, I mean, we benefited from them doing that.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:23.700]   We didn't have to, you know, we still do spend
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:26.180]   some subsidies on solar.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.620]   And I think they're very like poorly designed.
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.420]   So I would be better just to get rid of them.
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:35.740]   But the thing with fusion, if you're just heating up,
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:38.380]   heating up water to make steam, is that technology,
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:40.660]   there's no learning curve for anymore
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:42.580]   for steam engines, basically.
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:44.820]   'Cause, you know, that technology is so mature.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:46.580]   I mean, now, so that's why some people are looking
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:49.780]   at like super critical CO2 cycles is because,
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:51.700]   well, maybe this could be a little cheaper
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:53.900]   than doing steam turbines.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:55.740]   That's some possibility there.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:57.980]   But it's, and there's some other technologies
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.500]   that maybe someday you have like thermoelectric generators
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.340]   and stuff like that.
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:05.380]   But I think the direct conversion technologies
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:07.100]   have just a massive advantage.
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:11.540]   Not only in initial cost, but in ongoing operating costs.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:13.100]   - Okay, okay.
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.060]   There's one more topic I really wanted to talk about,
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:18.020]   which was, yeah, you have this interesting post
[02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:21.820]   on where you can actually expect to find alpha
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:24.420]   given that at least public markets are efficient.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:26.780]   I, do you want to like explain the basic thesis
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:30.380]   of that post before I ask you specific questions about it?
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:32.980]   - Yeah, if I was gonna like down that post down,
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:35.340]   like I love Fama's original paper
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:39.180]   where he lays out this efficient market hypothesis thesis.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.980]   And he's like, there's multiple types of information.
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:45.660]   And so the first is, if you just have like pricing data
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:47.900]   for stocks or whatever securities,
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:49.860]   like you can be the smartest person in the world
[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:52.140]   and you're not gonna make any money doing that
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.700]   'cause it's just like random.
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:57.900]   But the, if you start incorporating more information,
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.540]   like what's in 10 Ks and all that,
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.340]   like if you're like super, super smart,
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:05.740]   you might be able to make a little bit of money there.
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:09.700]   And, we see that with people like Renaissance Technologies
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:14.300]   and you can debate about Warren Buffet and all that.
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:15.720]   But then there's the third category,
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:17.780]   which is like the strong type information.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:20.700]   And it's basically you have legally acquired
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:25.700]   private information and the, you can make money that way
[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:27.300]   and be significantly less smart.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.700]   So if you wanna like just take Fama's paper
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:31.200]   and like, how do I make money?
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:34.020]   It's like, okay, well, I should find legal ways
[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:38.220]   to acquire this information.
[02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:40.540]   And then I don't have to be a super genius
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:41.580]   to make money on it.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:45.500]   - Yeah, what I thought was really interesting in your post
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:49.180]   was you had this point about how one of the ways
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.700]   you can actually earn excess returns
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:53.860]   is through like labor, right?
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:55.340]   Like Buffet in the early years,
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:57.060]   at least he would like go into these factories
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.940]   or companies and like interrogate every single piece
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:01.980]   of operations and whatever.
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:03.900]   And I thought that was an interesting twist
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.460]   on Piketty's thesis.
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:07.380]   So I don't know if you've seen his stuff,
[02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:09.540]   but he has this claim that well,
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:13.580]   not only does capital earn more than the gains to capital
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:16.460]   are higher than the gains to labor,
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:18.780]   but the more capital you have,
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:21.180]   the higher returns you can earn.
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:23.180]   Like I guess Harvard has access to hedge funds
[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:26.180]   that may be able to earn like excess returns.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:27.820]   I thought yours was like an interesting,
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:30.020]   basically if you take this view,
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:32.300]   it's basically the inversion of Piketty
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:35.980]   because like over time as Buffet has gotten wealthier,
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:37.180]   his returns have gone down
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:39.700]   because it's harder to like invest the marginal dollar
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:40.540]   more effectively.
[02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:42.180]   And as you said, with the medallion fund,
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:44.620]   yeah, they no longer accept outside money.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:47.820]   And then the interesting thing about labor
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:50.100]   is like the reason that Buffet was able to earn
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:51.380]   those excess returns at the beginning
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:53.460]   was because of the labor he put in, right?
[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:55.980]   So the interesting thing is like capital is just fungible
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:56.820]   with other capital.
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:58.940]   So capital doesn't enjoy as high returns
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:01.780]   as like really good labor, really smart labor,
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:04.300]   which is like the opposite of the Piketty thesis.
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:07.580]   - And I think there was actually a paper,
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:11.180]   I think it was on marginal revolution a couple of years back.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.420]   So I'm pulling from my memory here,
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.060]   so I could be missing a little bit,
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:18.780]   but basically it studied like all these businesses
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.060]   and what happened to the business
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:23.020]   after like a founder unexpectedly died.
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:25.420]   And like the profit just like,
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.860]   and it looks like on, these are capital returns.
[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:29.740]   So it's like many people would see them,
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:32.820]   but then the earnings just like drop like a rock,
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:37.140]   like 'cause they lost some irreplaceable human capital there
[02:18:37.140 --> 02:18:39.260]   and they didn't spend any time training
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:41.980]   'cause they died unexpectedly.
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:43.900]   - Right, which also has an interesting implication
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:47.380]   for CEO pay, which is just that actually like, okay,
[02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:49.940]   in the Marxist sense, what is pay?
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:54.000]   It's like your pay is what it costs to replace you, right?
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:59.700]   And if Steve Jobs is so irreplaceable that,
[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:01.420]   if he goes away, like earnings are gonna drop
[02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:05.340]   like a rock and stock price are gonna drop like a rock,
[02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:07.460]   actually that means that he should get paid,
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:09.620]   like if that's how expensive it is to replace him,
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:10.940]   he may be like irreplaceable, right?
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:12.960]   So it's actually worth whatever,
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.580]   like dozens of millions of dollars you're paying him.
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:19.060]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm generally a proponent
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:21.780]   for letting the market decide that.
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:22.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.900]   And then another way you suggested
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.260]   that maybe firms could earn excess returns
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.260]   is like by developing unique brand, right?
[02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:32.380]   So like Y Combinator is probably able to earn excess returns
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:34.220]   to a normal venture capitalist
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:35.620]   because of their unique brand.
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:36.900]   Yeah, I thought that was really interesting.
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.340]   Do you wanna talk more about that?
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:42.940]   - I think it's just like a lot of this intangible capital
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:46.700]   and labor are compliments for regular capital.
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.700]   And I think you can see it too,
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:52.120]   like if you build a brand around that,
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.860]   you're a good investor.
[02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:55.900]   Like you can raise money from other people
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:58.340]   and charge the money on it,
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:00.980]   more so than if you're just like a no-name.
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:02.740]   I think there's lots of examples of that
[02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:06.820]   where building a brand or building relationships
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:10.180]   is extremely valuable and can,
[02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:14.860]   just like specific knowledge can juice your returns.
[02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:17.140]   I mean, it's like a type of specific knowledge.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:19.980]   - Well, what do you mean it's a specific knowledge?
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:22.380]   - Well, I mean, to build a brand like Y Combinator,
[02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:26.580]   you have to like understand what tech founders want.
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:30.500]   So they use that knowledge to create
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:34.560]   a place that's great to go do your startup.
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, interesting.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:39.580]   Is the market for blogging efficient?
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:44.740]   So now there's actually a financial rewards to blogging.
[02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:45.900]   The Effective Ideas Blog Prize,
[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:48.460]   there's other kinds of grants like this.
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:50.220]   Recently opened philanthropy contest of,
[02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:52.460]   you suggest a cause area to have like,
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:54.380]   you know, there's many prizes where like if you're good,
[02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:56.260]   it seems like if you're pretty really good at blogging,
[02:20:56.260 --> 02:20:57.900]   you could like earn six figures, it seems,
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:01.740]   given like the regularity and size of these prizes.
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:04.300]   Yeah, so is this a market
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:06.260]   that we should expect to be efficient?
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:08.100]   - I think it would be hard to measure,
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.380]   like given my own experience, like I'm blogging for free,
[02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:13.360]   but the benefits I've gotten from learning
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.460]   about what I'm blogging about,
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:17.820]   and then like a few connections I've made,
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:20.100]   that then helped me like with what I'm,
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:21.860]   my projects I'm working on,
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:23.820]   you know, like there's like huge returns could,
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:26.180]   and it could be, you know, like my project successful,
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:29.100]   like it'd be just like almost immeasurable.
[02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:33.620]   So yeah, I would guess it's very hard to measure
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:36.920]   and probably inefficient in that more people could blog,
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:40.020]   'cause it's hard to predict the returns
[02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:41.820]   to what you're blogging might have.
[02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:44.760]   But I guess if you're gonna do these blog prizes,
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:45.940]   I don't know if the blog prize, you know,
[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:48.100]   because the blog prizes are about specific topics,
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:49.860]   I don't know if that,
[02:21:49.860 --> 02:21:52.060]   how much that helps the efficiency there.
[02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:53.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:54.420]   Let's take that part of it out.
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:56.180]   Let's just talk about the factor you mentioned,
[02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.380]   which is that you can,
[02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:59.260]   this is a regular thing you hear from people
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:02.300]   who write online, which is that the gains they get are huge.
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.380]   And that's also the case in my case.
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:06.220]   And so it's kind of interesting.
[02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:07.740]   I guess efficient markets doesn't like,
[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:08.860]   just because the stock market is efficient
[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:10.260]   doesn't mean that everybody will put their money
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:11.180]   into the stock market, right?
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.020]   That's not the implication.
[02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:15.360]   So it's very possible that you have irrational actors
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:18.400]   who are not like invested in or like writing.
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.500]   But then the question is,
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:22.340]   given that you write something that's high quality,
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:25.340]   will it get noticed by the market?
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:26.820]   Like, will it get the attention
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:30.140]   and broadcasting that it deserves?
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.260]   And in my experience, actually,
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.700]   like, I guess this was the case,
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:34.500]   you mentioned that some of your first posts
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:35.880]   ended up on Hacker News, right?
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.900]   So in that sense, that market was efficient.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:39.780]   But yeah, it seems to me that when somebody
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:42.260]   finds a good blogger that they,
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.840]   it's not hard for their initial post
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:47.640]   or like at least their subsequent posts
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.520]   as they get better to gain an audience.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.600]   - Yeah, I do think that.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:55.840]   And I don't know what the counterfactual is.
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:57.600]   We don't know about the people that
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:01.160]   didn't have posts go to Hacker News.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.680]   So like it could have easily been.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:05.560]   I mean, I think that what the alternative for me
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:07.960]   is I just would have blogged way less,
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:12.120]   if one of those early posts hadn't gotten more attention.
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:14.540]   So yeah, it's hard to know what the counterfactual is,
[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:16.980]   how many people have just like abandoned blogs
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:18.340]   that did like three posts
[02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:20.000]   and they would have written one more.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.640]   Maybe it would have been better.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:24.300]   Okay, awesome.
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.140]   This has been a lot of fun.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.660]   Thank you so much for,
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:28.740]   I think we're two hours over at this point.
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:31.380]   So thank you so much for your time.
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:32.380]   - All right, thank you.
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:33.580]   - I don't know if you have any other like
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:35.060]   other final thoughts or any other subjects
[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:37.980]   that we should hit on or?
[02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:40.780]   - No, I think we covered everything.
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.820]   - All right, cool, cool.
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:42.660]   Awesome.
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:47.460]   And then just people can find you at austinvernon.
