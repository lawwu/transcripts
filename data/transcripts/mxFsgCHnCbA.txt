[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   So this is today's deep question.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:14.080]   Why does cultivating the deep life start with discipline?
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.520]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380]   a distracted world.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.260]   So for those who are watching at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia, episode 256, or at thedeeplife.com, you'll notice
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:44.320]   I am back in the Deep Work HQ, the original studio, joined in person by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.140]   Jesse, I'm already nostalgic for this place.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.140]   It's good to have you back.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.860]   Now, I'm only back temporarily.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.380]   I'm just in DC for a few days.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.500]   We wanted to make sure that we got a recording at the old HQ.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   I'll be back in New Hampshire for most of the rest of the summer.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.420]   So most of the rest of the summer, I will be broadcasting out of the Deep Work HQ North
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.860]   up in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.940]   However, I am bringing back up with me quite a bit of equipment.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.020]   So for my first stay up North, I flew up there, I had a small bag.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.700]   I brought bare bones equipment.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.660]   I'm driving back up this week.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.340]   So I'm bringing some cameras and some switchers and some lights.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.540]   So you'll see if you're watching, if you're watching at youtube.com/CalNewPortMedia, you
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.180]   should hopefully see in the weeks that come, me making Deep Work HQ North closer and closer
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.820]   to HQ South in terms of both the quality and the visual look.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.180]   So I'm excited about that project.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.100]   But you know what, Jesse, there's nothing better than the actual studio itself.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.220]   And you're bringing the shirt up, right?
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.260]   I'm bringing the shirt.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.020]   So we're going to try to replicate it, but it's never going to be the same as the DC,
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.020]   the Coma Park studio.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.540]   It'll, it'll be a triumphant moment, triumphant moment when we return for good.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.540]   I can tell you're determined.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540]   So you're going to make it work.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.620]   I'm going to make a cool studio up there, but it's not going to be the same.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.020]   So it'll be cool when we get back.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.340]   You know, just in time for me to leave and go North for the summer, Jesse, the bookstore
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.700]   down the street finally opened.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   Oh, it did?
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.300]   So I, just in time when I could be in there buying books daily, it opened just as I was
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   leaving.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900]   So we'll have to, we'll have to check that out more when I get back.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.340]   If you're in the Tacoma park area, people's books, Tacoma park, it's open.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.060]   It's rock and rolling.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.060]   Check it out.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.060]   We'll have to do something there at some point, Jesse.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060]   It's a cool space.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060]   It's a cool space.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.460]   Um, so what are we going to talk about today?
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.060]   I wanted to get into a question or issue that you, the listeners have been bringing up recently,
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.340]   an issue with, or a question about, I should say the deep life stack, the deep life stack
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.500]   being the, the rough organizing framework we've been using recently to think through
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.540]   the quest to escape the shallows and make your working and professional personal life
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.540]   more deeper.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.580]   The sort of central question of this show, we've organized it more recently around this
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.980]   notion of the deep life stack.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.600]   And there's a question about the stack that I wanted to address, but just as a reminder
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.300]   for those who are new to this, let me actually bring up on the screen here, uh, the old diagram
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.220]   of the deep life stack I drew a few weeks ago.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.620]   So again, this is if you're watching, this is episode 256.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.060]   That's what you should look for at youtube.com/calendpartmedia.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.620]   So you see on the screen, if you're watching the deep life stack, we have a series of four
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.320]   layers that you move through in order as you're trying to transform your life from something
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.940]   that is shallow and reactive to something that's more intentional and deep.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.000]   So we had this first layer was reestablished discipline.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.900]   The second layer was build a foundation of values.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.860]   The third layer was create calm through control.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   And then the final layer was plan for the remarkable.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.980]   That's where you actually get to the different areas of your life, what we used to call the
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.100]   buckets and trying to overhaul them one by one to be more intentional and remarkable.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.540]   There's an arrow at the top that says iterate, because you go back through this at least
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.860]   once a year and clean up different layers, revisit different layers.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220]   All right, here's the question.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.900]   The question that I was sent from many of you is why discipline is at the bottom.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.680]   Why is not values at the bottom?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.780]   Why not figure out what really matters to you?
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.020]   And in there, you will find the motivation in there.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.300]   This is the question people are asking me.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.940]   Why not have values first?
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.940]   Because in there, you'll find the motivation to do everything else.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.620]   That's where you'll get your orientation.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.540]   So there's a reason why I don't have values first.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.260]   And I want to talk about it today because I think it's just useful in general for thinking
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.860]   about the types of transformations we discuss on the show.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.200]   So this is today's deep question.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.060]   Why does cultivating the deep life start with discipline?
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.620]   Now here's the framework I want you to use when thinking about this question.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.140]   When it comes to making changes in your life, there's really two types of goals, and we
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.180]   will call the one type externally powered and the other type internally powered.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.300]   So what I mean by this is externally powered goals are changes to your behavior or consistent
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.560]   actions aimed towards an objective that are driven by a palpable sense of excitement or
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.420]   motivation in the moment.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.140]   So for an externally powered goal, you feel motivation, you're excited in the moment.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.860]   Yes, I want to do this.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.600]   I like the way it makes me feel.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.300]   An internally powered goal, by contrast, is one where these changes or consistent actions
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.280]   are driven by an internal sense of efficacy.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.980]   You trust that you can keep going on something you deem important, even if it doesn't feel
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.980]   desirable in the moment.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.300]   You trust yourself to make progress on what matters because you know the long term results
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.900]   is where you get your fulfillment.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.700]   You trust yourself to be able to stick with it, even if in the moment you say, I'm not
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.640]   excited about this anymore.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.060]   I don't really want to do it right now.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.780]   So if we think about some examples here, I've long labeled for the aspiring novelist National
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.100]   Novel Writing Month to be an externally powered goal.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.780]   The whole idea about National Novel Writing Month is that you get really excited about
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.180]   the idea of being a novelist and you drift on this and you surf on this motivation through
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.580]   this month with a bunch of other people all doing the same thing right every day.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.500]   You let the excitement about it carry you through to very quickly get a manuscript done.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.220]   An internally powered goal, by contrast, for the aspiring novelist might be the slow accumulation
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.220]   of pages.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.180]   Maybe you want to finish four short stories over the course of an entire year, each of
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.000]   which you're going to bring to a writing group that's going to critique and give you feedback
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.560]   that you can then integrate into the next story.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.000]   When you're on month five of this one year long plan, just putting in your pages, even
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.800]   though you don't feel like it, even though you're tired, even though the last short story
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.460]   didn't work long after the ardor for novelist life has passed, that is an internally powered
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.460]   goal.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.100]   Another example is talking about fitness, doing that one time action because you're
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.520]   pumped up about getting in better shape.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.440]   Maybe you had a health scare or you're inspired seeing or reading about someone who is in
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   really good shape.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   You buy that gym membership or you tell your partner, I'm overhauling my eating.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.140]   I want you to be really hard on me if you see me eating the wrong stuff.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.940]   That's in the moment.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.840]   You're driven by the in the moment excitement.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.880]   Like I'm definitely going to do this.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.440]   So let me try to set things up to force myself or to keep myself inspired to do the work.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.760]   Whereas an internally powered goal towards something like health and fitness might be
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.440]   that actual just reshaping of your schedule that has that space every day for the long
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.920]   walk has that space most days for some type of training, something that gets you to the
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.640]   home gym and just doing it.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.600]   And it's five months in and you just do it.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   I don't want to do it today.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.880]   There's nothing particularly exciting that I've seen recently.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.560]   I haven't even been thinking about fitness recently.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.160]   I've been interested in something else.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.880]   I still go to the garage and lift those weights.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.960]   I still move the meetings to make sure that four to five is always clear so I can get
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   to the gym.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.040]   That's more internally powered.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.000]   Definitely watching productivity YouTube to try to motivate yourself to work really hard.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.720]   Wow, look at these people with these well edited clips that have all this musical montage
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.160]   is working hour after hour on YouTube.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.600]   Now I'm motivated to try to finish this hard thing all in one push.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.560]   That's externally powered goal versus the internally powered goal of just sticking with
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:36.160]   a semester, weekly, daily time block planning, multi-scale planning, just doing the work,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.960]   making the plan, executing the plan again and again, letting results pile up over time.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.680]   All right, so here's the thing.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.580]   If you are not comfortable with internally powered goals, you are not going to succeed
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.720]   transforming your life using the deep life stack.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   Now think about values.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   For example, let's say instead of becoming comfortable with internally powered goals,
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.800]   you said, let me just start with my values first.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.600]   Let me figure out what it is I care about, what should be motivating me.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.920]   Here's the reality about this.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:14.880]   A refined and powerful sense of values is based as much in experience as it is in self-reflection.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.400]   If you are coming to values first from a context in which you basically exist in a setting
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.200]   of externally powered goals, you go after things only when you're motivated and then
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.000]   your interest wanes when that motivation goes away.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.240]   If you live in that type of world of reactive ambition, the values you come up with themselves
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.520]   will be warped.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.160]   They're going to push you towards things that are maybe easier than harder.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.800]   When you try to think about how do I put my values into action, you're going to avoid
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.760]   things that require regular, difficult, disciplined action and find things that are more less
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.640]   demanding, less in the moment.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.200]   You're not going to have the iterative experience of pursuing hard things and seeing what matters
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.880]   and what doesn't that's needed to have more insights.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.640]   You will come up with values, but they're not going to be true to you.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.440]   They're not going to be in their most powerful state.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.520]   They are going to warp themselves around your general mindset of reactivity, of externally
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   powered goals, of chasing what seems exciting in the moment.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.340]   On the other hand, if you have an internally powered goal mindset, if you're comfortable
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.000]   with that, you're going to have more rigorous values.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.600]   You're going to have values that are more born out of experience.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.080]   And the routines and codes and rituals you build around them are going to be more demanding
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.960]   and therefore probably more effective.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.040]   If you don't have an externally powered goal mindset, you will fail when you get to the
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.800]   calm stack as well.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.120]   Finding control, calm through control.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   This is where you get your systems in order.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.300]   You organize your obligations in time, you find breathing room.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.640]   That's all internally powered goals to do that consistently.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.920]   So you will fail there if you're not comfortable with that.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.680]   And if you get to the planning layer without comfort with these type of goals, you will
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.440]   also fail because your plans for overhauling different buckets in your life, if built only
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   around externally powered goals, will have these flashes of motivation and then crumble
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   away.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.400]   Very little long-term or sustainable transformation will happen.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.640]   So at every layer, every layer of the deep life stack, you are going to struggle if you're
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.760]   coming at it from a mindset of, I only do externally powered goals.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.360]   This is what that first discipline layer is really about in the current version of the
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.000]   stack we're using.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.040]   Discipline is on the bottom, not to have some sort of martial allegiance to rigorously defining
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.560]   your life as this is the end-all or be-all.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.880]   What I really mean by that layer, and this is the way I consistently explain it, is that
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:49.280]   you start by choosing a small number of things, two or three, tied to areas of your life that
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   are important.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.360]   So you have a variety, there might be a sort of a community one here and a fitness health
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   one here, maybe something related to craft or whatever is important.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.720]   Two or three things tied to areas that are important, where you have a daily discipline
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:08.480]   that is carefully selected to not be trivial, but to also remain tractable.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.180]   You're in that region of tractability that is right beyond triviality.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.920]   So it's not simple to do.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.280]   It's not, I'm going to touch my gym shoes every morning, but it's also not, I'm going
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.760]   to get up at four and run 12 miles every morning.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   Sometimes I get my coffee and do this 20 minute walk and jump on the pull-up bar in the park
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   halfway through.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.400]   And I'm just doing that every morning before my day even gets started.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.040]   It's not trivial, but it is definitely tractable.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   So you have these daily disciplines, two to three, that's it, covering a couple of different
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   areas of your life.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.680]   And you do them every day.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.960]   And you mark that you did it every day.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.280]   If you use something like my time block planner, there's a metric tracking space where you
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.520]   can write this every day.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   If you don't, you can have another type of notebook.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.080]   There's a friend of mine who buys these oversized wall mounted calendars.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.120]   You see all 30 day calendar on one big sheet.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.680]   That's, I would say, you know, two feet by two feet, hangs it on his wall.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.400]   And for his core disciplines, he marks a big X on the day.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   It's a Seinfeld method.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Don't break the chain.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.320]   So you're just seeing, did I do it or did I not?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.600]   Now you can put all of your energy, not into some grand scheme, some grand overhaul of
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.800]   your life, some impossibly ambitious, I'm going to become a ultra marathoner.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.360]   You can instead put all of your energy into just, here's a small number of tractable,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   but non-trivial daily disciplines.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   I want to mark it on my sheet every day.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   That's doable.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   That'll stretch you if you're from an externally powered goal mindset, but it's not going to
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.120]   stretch you to an impossible degree.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.000]   And that is the main focus of that first discipline layer.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.040]   If you do this long enough, daily disciplines, your mindset shifts, the way you think of
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   yourself shifts.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:02.160]   And you begin to think of yourself as someone who is capable of and attracted to internally
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.440]   powered goals.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.980]   And now all the other layers are enabled.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.880]   Now you can attack the values true to what really matters to you with the rigor required
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.120]   for that to make a difference in your life.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.880]   You can track the finding calm through control with systems that you're going to stick with
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.200]   and actually benefit from that, benefit from that consistency.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.120]   You're going to get the planning and actually trust yourself to be able to make potentially
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.220]   significant overhauls that take effort over time and diligent focus and the turning your
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.680]   attention away from distractions month after month.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.360]   All of this becomes possible, which means the deep life becomes possible.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.520]   So that's why I put the discipline as the first layer.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.640]   Now there's other parts to it.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.880]   The other thing I want you to do when you get to the discipline layer is just create
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.560]   your central repository.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.420]   Here's where I write down all the systems and disciplines I'm following.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.600]   You do want one place for that.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.920]   So that's the other part of discipline is just having a place where you just say, this
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.960]   is where I keep track of the things I do.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.280]   So I just have one place to look.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.840]   So you set up that first folder.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.480]   It could be physical or digital.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   I don't care.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.600]   And then you start.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   The first thing you put in this is going to be your initial daily disciplines.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.640]   As you move up the stack, you'll develop more systems, more routines, codes, disciplines,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.760]   all that will go into that same folder that you created up front.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.420]   But this is really again, why discipline is first is that if you don't shift your mindset
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.040]   to the internally powered efficacy, nothing else is going to happen.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.680]   Everything else is going to be flights of motivation.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.360]   And then you're going to see your intention begin to crumble.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.720]   Now we see this in some classic tales.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.320]   There's some classic tales, books are on the internet, internet famous or book famous figures
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.480]   who had exactly this order of operations in the transformation of their life, beginning
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.840]   with disciplined activity.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.060]   Often times arbitrary seeming discipline that then changed their mindset and enabled a much
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.460]   more intentional transformation of their life.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.460]   Thinking about Rich Roll.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.420]   Rich Roll, the Rich Roll podcast.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:02.500]   If you go back and read his memoir, Finding Ultra, what do you see?
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.900]   We see Rich was a college athlete.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.300]   Actually I don't know if you know this Jesse around here.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   He swam.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   He was at Langdon.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.300]   Oh really?
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   He was a swimmer.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.940]   But a really competitive swimmer.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:22.540]   Swam D1 at Stanford, had Olympic aspirations, developed substance abuse problems, went to
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.820]   law school, became a lawyer, had drug and alcohol problems, got sober, but sort of when
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.140]   he got sober, he traded it off for eating terribly.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.660]   So he finds himself around Jesse and I's age right now.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.060]   And he is really out of shape.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.860]   He walks up the stairs in his house.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.620]   This is what he talks about in his memoir.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.620]   After eating cheeseburgers late at night and winded.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.660]   He finds himself winded.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.020]   And he's like, this is enough.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.020]   Something has to change.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.940]   He doesn't really know how to do the change.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:59.140]   So what he just does, why not, is he puts on his running shoes and goes for a run.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.340]   He lives down in Calabasas.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.340]   Beautiful house actually.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.020]   He goes for a run and he talks about this book.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.660]   He ends up running some absurd distance, like 18 miles or something.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.620]   He just sort of just keeps going and then comes back and something about that clicks.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.220]   And he says, I'm just going to exercise.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.700]   And he just starts exercising, which he was sort of used to from his college athletic
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.060]   days, but he just starts exercising.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.140]   And after a while he's saying, like, I want to train and do some sort of endurance of
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.140]   it.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.140]   This is his daily discipline.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.140]   I'm just going to do this one thing.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.700]   I'm going to start just training for endurance type sports.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.820]   And that becomes the core that transforms his life.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.740]   And of course, he becomes famously a vegan and then starts doing these really attention
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.740]   catching endurance athletic challenges and then transforms that over to his podcast,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.700]   a ritual podcast, where now he's more of a sort of elder statesman of the self-improvement
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.740]   space and delivering life wisdom to people and has built this whole really cool career
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.380]   and lifestyle around all of this and completely healthy guy, completely in tune with himself
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   and his spirit.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.380]   But it all started with an arbitrary discipline.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.380]   I'm going to run long distances.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:10.340]   And it's not that there's something specific about running long distances.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.460]   That was really important for the way he envisioned his life.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.340]   I think it was the discipline.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:22.380]   Transformed his mindset, reactivated the confidence in his ability to go after internally powered
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.540]   goals and then everything else in his life changed after that.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.940]   Jocko Willink, I think of the same way.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.940]   If you listen to how Jocko Willink, the former Navy SEAL and host of the Jocko podcast, if
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:41.380]   you talk about his story, when he joined the Navy to become a SEAL, he was a young sort
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.260]   of punk kid that was up to no good, sort of adrift.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.260]   He sought discipline.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.540]   And again, this is arbitrary discipline.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.020]   I'm going to do special operations training.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.340]   It requires incredible discipline.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.620]   But you'll see in his story that that then transformed him.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.820]   The discipline of, in this case, special forces training gave him this idea of I can handle
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.060]   internally powered goals.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   I can control my life.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   And now he has molded himself into someone who is the opposite of a punk kid, but someone
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.140]   who lives by a code and values.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:18.420]   He was literally involved in the writing of the Navy SEAL code, the code by which Navy
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.420]   SEALs now identify that they work and operate.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.740]   The discipline came first.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.620]   The transformation came second.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:30.420]   I think we see something similar in Cheryl Strait's book, Wild.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.420]   I say your name wrong often, Jesse.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.100]   We should look it up at Cheryl Strait.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.260]   Am I saying that properly?
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.260]   That sounds right.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.260]   Yeah, you look it up.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.020]   Anyways, I don't know if you're familiar, you might know her from her columns and what
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.060]   she's done since, but if you've seen the Reese Witherspoon movie that was made about her
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:56.660]   breakout nonfiction memoir, Wild, again, what you see in that memoir is Cheryl took on a
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.180]   act of arbitrary discipline at a time when her life was all over the place and out of
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   control.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.820]   So, arbitrary act of discipline was hiking the Pacific Coast Trail.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.820]   Straid.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   Straid.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   Cheryl Straid.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   S-T-R-A-Y-E-D.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   That's how I wrote it down, actually.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.820]   All right, I had it right.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   Cheryl Straid.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:19.220]   So, it's an arbitrary discipline, but she was having drug problems and was really having
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.300]   a hard time dealing with, I believe it was the death of her mother, and there's all sorts
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.540]   of issues going on.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.500]   Arbitrary discipline.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.460]   But what that did was then shifted her mindset to say, okay, internally powered goals are
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.260]   something I can do, and now, obviously, as a very influential cultural commentator and
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.740]   thinker, it helped her get out of that really difficult place.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.420]   So, we see this often in classic stories as well.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.140]   The seemingly arbitrary discipline becomes the foundation on which all the intentional
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.820]   stuff is built.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.380]   And that is the mindset shift I want you to do.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.020]   Until you're used to this identity of yourself as someone who can do these types of internally
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.260]   powered goals, all of the navel gazing in the world is not going to get you very far.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.100]   All the thinking through what really matters is not going to get you very far.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:10.300]   You're going to see activity burst in flames of inspiration that then dissipate as the
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.940]   winds of everyday life and the grounding realities of normal responsibilities take away that temporary
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.940]   charge.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.220]   And so, it's a mindset shift comes first, everything else follows.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.220]   So, that is why I have discipline as the very first layer of the stack.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.660]   All right.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.940]   So, what we're going to do is I pulled some questions that all, I think, roughly orbit
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.860]   this notion of discipline and applying disciplines as the solution.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.980]   So, the sort of using discipline to change your mindset that all roughly orbits that
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   central idea.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.620]   So, they're questions from you, the listeners.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.420]   And then we have a something interesting segment at the end where we'll talk about an unrelated
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.980]   topic that you sent in to my interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.500]   First I want to mention one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.220]   That's our good friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.500]   Jesse, I gave my Hinson blade a real workout today.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.420]   I hadn't shaved in two days coming into this morning, right?
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.340]   Because I flew back from New Hampshire and we were working, you know, packing and working
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.700]   around the house and, you know, wasn't out and about in the world.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.540]   And I said, okay, we got quite a bit of growth here.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.820]   Let's see if my Hinson razor is up for it.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.100]   And as you can see, it was.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:35.620]   And here's the thing, one 10 cent safety razor blade put into this beautiful Hinson razor
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.660]   could handle multiple days, multiple days of growth smoothly, no razor burn, no nicks.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.660]   How does this work?
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:49.200]   Because the Hinson razor is this again, beautifully designed precision milled piece of aluminum.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.340]   The people at Hinson know how to do this.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.980]   Their day job, so to speak, is designing parts for the aerospace industry.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.020]   So they have these high precision routers that can build metals to extreme tolerances.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.600]   So you get this beautifully milled piece of aluminum.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.240]   You put just a standard 10 cent safety razor blade in there, you screw it on and you have
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:13.260]   only .0013 inches of blade extending beyond either side of the razor housing, which means
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.940]   you get no up and down flexing or diving board effect.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.180]   You get just a very rigid cutting edge.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:24.740]   And so that one blade in this beautifully designed razor can give you a very good shave,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.480]   gets rid of clog, gets rid of burns, gets rid of nicks.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.880]   It's also quite affordable.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.820]   You pay a little more up front for the razor itself, but because you're using 10 cent blades,
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.120]   it quickly becomes cheaper to operate than using a subscription service or going to the
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:46.740]   drugstore every month to buy the disposable sort of plastic housed 97 blade, whatever
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.100]   apparatuses they're selling these days.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.220]   So this is why I love my my Hinson razor and I recommend it.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.480]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.140]   Visit HinsonShaving.com/Cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll get two
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.540]   years worth of blades for free with your razor.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.660]   Just add the two year supply to your cart.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:13.260]   And when you enter the promo code CAL at checkout, the cost of those will drop to zero.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:24.220]   That's 100 free blades when you head to HinsonShaving.com/Cal and use that code CAL.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:31.600]   We also want to talk about our friends at the always fun to pronounce Zoc Doc.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.460]   This is one of those products that just makes so much sense.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.500]   I'm surprised that it didn't exist before or I'm surprised I ever got along with out
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.560]   it.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:48.520]   So Zoc Doc is a free app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments online.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.700]   We're talking about booking appointments with thousands of top rated patient review doctors
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.900]   and specialists.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.780]   You can filter for doctors who take your insurance who are located near you and treat almost
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.080]   any condition you're searching for.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   You can also look at reviews.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.580]   So this just makes it easy.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.580]   I need a podiatrist.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.660]   I need a new primary care physician.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.660]   I'm looking for a dentist.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.260]   You just go to Zoc Doc, your Zoc Doc app or Zoc Doc.com and you say, "This is what I'm
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.940]   looking for in this area.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   Takes this insurance."
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.400]   Boom, here they are.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   Which ones are taking appointments?
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   Great.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.740]   And then you can click and say, "Okay, what are the reviews?
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.740]   What do actual patients think?
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.400]   Oh, patients really like this doctor.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   It's nearby.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.460]   It takes my insurance.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460]   They're taking new appointments.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460]   Great.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.540]   Let's book an appointment right now."
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.680]   It really makes healthcare much easier to navigate.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.740]   No more just asking around your friends, "Hey, do you know a podiatrist that you like?"
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   And they said, "No, I've never.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.820]   I haven't gone to one."
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.060]   It takes all that out of it.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:49.540]   It is the smart way of actually finding medical care providers and then working with those
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   providers.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.500]   I've had, I guess, three different doctors now that have used, that use Zoc Doc.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.620]   So not only does it help me find them, but also the appointment booking, also the reminders.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.020]   When they're in the Zoc Doc ecosystem, you get great reminders.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.140]   "Hey, appointments are coming up.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.060]   You could do paperwork online in advance."
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:12.180]   I'm a big fan of Zoc Doc and the Zoc Doc ecosystem.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:20.680]   I'm also a big fan of being able to say ZocDoc.com as much as possible.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:26.820]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep to download the Zoc Doc app for free, then find a book at Top
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.980]   Rated Doctor today.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.020]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:40.260]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.620]   Sounds good.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.580]   First question's from Fahad, a 21-year-old student.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.120]   "I feel like I have two different personalities.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.820]   One who's very productive and intentional, another who wants to be a slob, scroll social
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.940]   media, play video games, and watch TV all day.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.500]   How do I stop falling into the slob state?"
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.940]   Well, Fahad, it's a good question.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.380]   It's not a original question.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.860]   And I mean that in the good sense of your issue is not unusual.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.260]   Your issue is not something very specific to you.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.980]   And in particular, your issue here has nothing to do with some sort of intrinsic character
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.500]   flaw that has been overcome.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.380]   I think we often miss, when we talk about tales of people who diligently and disciplinely
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:29.660]   work through big accomplishments, we often miss the subtlety that goes into setting up
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.780]   a lifestyle or work environment in which you actually are able to maintain motivation and
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.340]   accomplish something big.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.420]   That is a lot more subtle than we give credit to.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.340]   It's not just about some people are able to white knuckle it and some people are weak.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.260]   It's much more complicated than that.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.060]   There's a couple of things I want to focus on here as being important.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.420]   One has to do with how you choose what you work on.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.220]   One has to do with how you build a lifestyle or approach actually working on it.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.980]   So let's start with the choice question.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.080]   And then the second piece will cover more.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.180]   That's going to overlap more with the central theme of today's episode about cultivating
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.340]   discipline as a mindset.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.020]   But let's start first with the choice of project.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.140]   Oftentimes, especially for young people, and Fahad, you say here you're 21 years old.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.360]   So that counts as you.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.620]   You're half Jesse and I's age, which is its own psychological issue for Jesse and I to
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.620]   deal with.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.620]   But don't worry about that.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.900]   For someone who's young like you, you have to be very careful in what you choose to work
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.480]   on.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.460]   So there's a couple of things that is going to potentially short circuit your motivation.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.220]   One is you just set too much stuff on your plate.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.180]   Yeah, I'm gonna do this and this and this because I can't wait to get started and I
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.900]   want to work on all these things.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.940]   And I just want to get really motivated and go for it.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.300]   And your mind gets exhausted and says, we can't be starting a business and AC in our
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.660]   classes and writing a book and training to be in really good shape.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.320]   It's just too many things.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.140]   The energy involved in trying to keep up with these things is too much.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.260]   And it just seems intractable and forget it.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.260]   Motivation is gone.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.500]   The other type of issue that happens here is that your mind, you maybe have one or two
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.500]   things.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.580]   It's not the quantity, but your mind doesn't trust your plan for execution.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:14.220]   You're like, yeah, I want to look like Thor, but all you're doing is sort of just randomly
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.220]   going to the gym and sort of lifting weights.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.340]   And your mind's like, you don't know what this is not going to lead to Thor.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.060]   We're not going to look, we're just doing random stuff.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.100]   Or you say, I want to be a famous writer and you're sort of writing every day and your
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.740]   mind says, this is not how this works.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.620]   Just you're writing kind of random stuff or with no guidance, no structure.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.620]   What's going to happen with this?
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.060]   We're not going to become a famous writer doing this.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.820]   So once your initial, just general excitement about being a writer dies off, we're going
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.900]   to withhold motivation and then you're going to find yourself falling off.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.820]   So being careful about how you choose what you work on a reasonable load and then study
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.020]   what you work on and make sure that your plan for approaching it is evidence-based and logical
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.020]   that your mind will trust.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.380]   Yeah, we're going to get results with what we're doing.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.180]   And to get there, especially if you're young, might mean bringing your ambition down and
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.220]   aiming at a much closer milestone.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.580]   So it's not, I want the Pulitzer Prize.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.260]   It's I want to be a regular contributor to the college magazine.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.320]   So you bring it down to a more proximate goal.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.300]   You have a plan to get there that your mind trusts.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.060]   So the choice of things matter if you want to have your motivation be sustained.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.060]   All right.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.300]   The second big category here comes to that mindset we talked about earlier during the
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.180]   deep dive earlier in the show.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.220]   Does your mind think of yourself as someone who is able to handle and stick with internally
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.420]   motivated goals?
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.300]   It sounds like right now, no.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.980]   So when I hear I get going, I'm reading you here, I'm very productive and intentional,
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.220]   and then it sort of falls off and I become a slob.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:51.820]   If I had to guess, this productivity and intentionality might be aimed in part at externally powered
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.820]   goals.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.780]   You're working because you're very motivated about some particular outcome.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.780]   You got yourself excited about it, watching YouTube videos or reading something and something
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.820]   got captured you and got your attention going.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.920]   And that's what's motivating you to do the work, to return to the books, to return to
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.180]   putting in effort.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:14.640]   And when that external power begins to dissipate, then social media TV comes back.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.200]   So seeing yourself instead as someone who finds pride in sticking with internally powered
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.100]   goals, you're going to have less ups and downs.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.100]   How do you do that?
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.700]   I go back to the deep life stack.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.260]   I would start with the discipline layer.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.540]   I would choose two to three daily disciplines covering a couple of different areas in your
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:36.540]   life that are non-trivial, but are also tractable and start marking on a sheet, on a time block
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.420]   planner, on a calendar, on your wall, wherever you want to do it.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.340]   Did I do each of these each day?
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.500]   And really do that for a whole semester.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.200]   Then return to, okay, what's my more ambitious goals for what I'm gonna do with my time?
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.000]   You will find that it's easier to stick with it.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.980]   Your mind is much more comfortable with, we believe in this, these are carefully chosen.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.000]   We stick with things even when they're hard.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.460]   That is what Fahad does.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.740]   That is who we are.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.620]   You change your self-conception by training your mind to think about what you're doing
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   differently.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.620]   All right.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.460]   So there's nothing, there's nothing wrong about you Fahad.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.100]   What's wrong is some of the details of your approach towards your very admirable goal
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.220]   of doing intentional, remarkable things with your time.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:22.900]   So choose carefully and spend some time developing a mindset of discipline, a comfort with internally
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:28.340]   powered goals, and I think you're going to find that this up and down whip sign between
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.740]   I'm working 10 hours a day and I'm on social media all day, that's going to start to even
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   out.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.980]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.140]   Okay.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.580]   Next question is from Jacob, a 20 year old from Colorado.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.340]   I seem to have contracted a case of what I call seasonal discipline, where I'll be very
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.780]   actively disciplined on following my habits and systems for a few months at a time, and
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.900]   then fall off really hard for a few months in an endless agonizing loop.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.300]   I'm wondering if you have any tips for cultivating a more consistent commitment to discipline.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.540]   You got a lot of young people today, Jesse.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.060]   I know, I was thinking the same thing.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   Makes us feel old.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.940]   You know, when you were doing the Henson Reed, I was thinking, you know, you haven't shaved
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.900]   in two days and I was like, mine, I go back and forth a lot, but mine's white now.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   Oh, mine is too.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.900]   I don't mind it.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.700]   I don't mind it, but my beard is, well, it's salt and pepper.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   But it's definitely white and I can see it at my sideburns as well.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.780]   My hair is still mainly brown, but, oh, that's coming.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.780]   That's coming.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.060]   We need, we need to balance these 20 year old questions.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.820]   I'm telling you, Jesse, next we'll get, I don't know, a 41 year old question is going
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:42.740]   to be, uh, like a combination of wanting to know about, uh, tax filing.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.380]   You know, I'm doing my schedule C deductions and wondering if this is, if this is the right,
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.060]   you know, line item to put that deduction.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:54.980]   So it's a mixture of talking about, um, yeah, tax filings and then also, I don't know what
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   else to.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.980]   Potential hair surgery.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   And like, yeah, hair surgery.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.260]   I am thinking about getting like this hair surgery for that hair surgery.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.860]   And I would kind of a tax question and also I'm tired all the time and I need to, should
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.580]   I get like hor, like testosterone treatment?
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.140]   Meanwhile, these young kids are, yeah.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:20.900]   I was up 12 hours, 20 hours straight working on my screenplay and we're like, I only get
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.060]   two hours of working in the morning before I fall asleep and take a nap.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.500]   Um, all right, Jacob, I'm sorry.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   Let's get back to your question.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   Seasonal discipline.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.620]   You, you, uh, some, some periods do well, some periods you do not so well.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   All right.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.300]   Very similar to Fahad.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.340]   So I'm going to have again, two solutions here where this is going to overlap with what
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.980]   I talked about with Fahad is just the mindset training piece.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.980]   So the very same thing I recommended Fahad that I recommended at the beginning of the
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.980]   show, I'm going to recommend as a starting point for you as well.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:55.580]   That discipline layer, that very first layer of the deep life stack two to three non-trivial
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.060]   and tractable, non-trivial, but tractable daily disciplines covering multiple areas
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.100]   of your life that you track every single day and put most of your productivity, intentionality,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.200]   focus, all that willpower on just doing those every day, not breaking the chain.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.900]   You want to market every day on a calendar.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:15.260]   It's a good tune-up just to get your mind back in shape as I don't need external power
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.260]   to do things.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.300]   I don't need to be in a season where I'm excited or things are going well to make progress
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   on important things.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.420]   I can also make progress in the hard seasons, in the proverbial winters when other things
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.380]   are going on or the work itself is not going so well.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.940]   See there's a mindset tune-up and I think that returning to that discipline layer can
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.940]   help with that.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.140]   And then just like with Fahad, but with slight differences in specifics here, I would say
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:45.860]   let's also think about what this, what you're calling here habits and systems, what these
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.540]   habits and systems are.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:55.180]   So even if you have the right internal conception of yourself, it is still the case that if
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:01.620]   the particular habits or systems you've put in place, if those particular habits and systems
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:07.260]   aren't sustainable or if they have a lot of friction, they work but they have overhead
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:13.180]   that don't need to be there and your mind senses that, you are going to accumulate stress
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.340]   fractures, right?
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.860]   You're going to accumulate over time this friction and grinding of the system's not
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.260]   quite right, it's too big, it's too hard, it has steps we don't need to do.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.060]   It's like the system's going to start building up these stretch fractures until the whole
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.860]   thing eventually breaks apart and that's maybe why you can only make a few months.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:35.760]   This is very common in the world of productivity systems that if the system is not compatible
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.940]   with your life and streamlined and believable, you can last with it for a while but it gets
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.940]   this clunky.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.060]   I'm typing these notes and it goes into this note system that then automatically populates
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.260]   these type of systems and every day I have a generative AI bot take these and generate
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.980]   a schedule and then I use that schedule to sort of schedule my hours.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:59.100]   These type of high overhead, high friction systems, they begin to just accumulate too
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.780]   much wear and tear until all of the gears get jammed and then you just say enough with
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.780]   this and you fall back to doing nothing until doing nothing after a while gets you so stressed
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.940]   out or overwhelmed by being disorganized that you go and build a new system and that starts
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.460]   generating friction until its gears mesh and then that could also be the source of what
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.720]   you're seeing here.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.740]   One season up, one season down, one season up, one season down.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.020]   So you also want to really check out your systems here.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.020]   Streamline them.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.540]   The simplest possible thing that actually helps you get your work done sometimes is
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.260]   the right thing to do.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.980]   Get rid of unnecessary things.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:35.260]   Have a core document where you keep track of here's what I do and how I do it so you're
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.580]   not just trying to keep track of things in your mind and you can see where there's overlap
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.360]   or redundancies or your systems are sort of out of control.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.620]   You want something that fits very naturally into your life.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.340]   So if you're starting from scratch here, I would say something like multi-scale planning.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.940]   You have a strategic plan, a weekly plan and do some sort of daily time block plan during
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.020]   work days but not the weekends.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.220]   Have some sort of good system for capture of your tasks so that you don't have to keep
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.700]   track of those things in your head.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:07.260]   Put those two things together, maybe mixed in with some sort of fixed schedule productivity
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.940]   mindset of this is my work hours and everything else has to fit into it.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.460]   That's a good start for organizing all the professional things in your life.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.820]   Use very simple tech tools for implementing this.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.420]   I'm talking, you know, you have a paper time block planner and then a couple of Google
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.580]   Docs to keep track of strategic plans and weekly plans.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.140]   You could use Trello to keep track of tasks or even just a long text file where you're
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.380]   typing things.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.580]   Simple technologies that are easy to get in and easy to get out that you can access from
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.640]   multiple platforms.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.940]   That makes a big difference.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:43.220]   As you add in other structures or goals around your personal life, keep it simple, you know.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.480]   So again, let's go for simplicity, accessibility.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.500]   Let's try to minimize friction.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.140]   Let's just make the general rhythm of your life something that's very sustainable.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.140]   That'll help too.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.940]   I don't know in your case, Jacob, which is the bigger problem.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.780]   So I don't know if it's a mindset issue that your systems are fine, but your mindset just
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.540]   needs right now external fuel for you to work on hard things, or if it's a systems problem,
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.780]   your mindset's fine, but your systems have too much friction.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.120]   So look at both.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:16.140]   But between those two things, I think you're going to find the seasonality of following
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.420]   systems is going to go away.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:27.500]   One epilogue I will add to this as well is don't reject seasonality outright as an issue.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.580]   I think it's an issue if your systems are seasonal.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.180]   I stopped being organized during some months versus others.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.740]   I think it's completely fine if your workload is seasonal.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.420]   In fact, in my new book, Slow Productivity, which is coming out in March, there's a whole
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.940]   principle is about working at a natural pace, and it really gets into seasonality and how
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.080]   natural and well suited humans are for that.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.060]   So I do want to throw that in there.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.580]   You might just be getting exhausted, right?
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.140]   Like a professor, by the time the professor gets to the end of spring, traditionally,
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.220]   they're exhausted because they've gone through a full school year.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.420]   So to actually pull back some in the summer makes sense because you need to recharge.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.060]   If you try to go all out in the summer after a hard spring and after a hard fall before
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.940]   that, you might just run out of steam altogether.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.020]   So I think seasonal workload could be fine as well.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.940]   So let's throw that in here, not just as an epilogue, but I'm going to throw this in,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   Jacob, as my third part of my answer.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.340]   Make your workload seasonal, but keep the systems the same.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.620]   You're still multi-scale planning, but when you get to some months of the year, the amount
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.940]   of stuff you're putting into your week and the complexity of your daily time block schedules
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.940]   are much easier.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.580]   And you get that relief of, man, this feels great.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.140]   I can really control my time.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.700]   I'm taking Thursdays completely off because why not?
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.260]   I'm using planning so I can move pieces around.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.260]   This is great.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.500]   I can actually extract a lot more relaxation and recharging because I have some structure.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.060]   So I think a seasonal workload could be excellent, but you don't want your systems to come and
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:50.020]   go seasonally and you want to make sure that your mindset is one that doesn't require external
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.020]   power.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.020]   So there we go.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.420]   I upgraded this from two parts to three parts, Jacob, and hopefully you will find that useful.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.820]   All right.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.380]   Let's keep going here, Jesse.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.740]   And then the time management video on our YouTube channel is definitely something you should
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.740]   check out.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.740]   So look under the, what's it, Core Ideas is the playlist?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.740]   Right.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   So youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   Look at the playlist.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.980]   There's a playlist called Core Ideas.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.500]   There's one titled, a video titled time management, right?
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.380]   I talk about that multiscale, multiscale planning.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.380]   Shows up, shows up right in there.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.380]   It's a good place to start.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.580]   All right.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.620]   Next question is from Loyad from India.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.460]   I often take on multiple projects, but then they, as they become hard, I abandon them
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.460]   halfway.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.460]   How do I stop doing this?
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.460]   All right.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.380]   So we have a very consistent type theme today.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.940]   I think the reader could, or the listener could almost answer this question on their
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   own now, which is my goal.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   I really want to hammer this point home as much as I can.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.900]   So Loyad, why are you abandoning projects when they become hard halfway?
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.120]   Well, as you can imagine, I'm going to have two parts to my answer here.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.000]   One is mindset.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.340]   If your mindset is one that depends on external power for you to get through goals, you are
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.860]   not going to get very far in hard projects because the external power, which in this
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:17.740]   case is that actual emotional feeling of motivation, excitement will die down as projects go on
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.220]   as they get harder and then you'll stop doing them.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.660]   So you need to reshape your mindset towards one and seeing yourself as someone who can
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.100]   handle internally powered goals.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.620]   Guess I'm going to suggest you do that.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.780]   Layer one of the deep life stack, two to three daily disciplines, non-trivial, but tractable
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.580]   everyday mark them.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.580]   Just train your mind.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.660]   I do things that are important for me, even if they're hard, even if I'm not excited
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.060]   in the moment and there's a deeper satisfaction I get out of that.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.900]   That's why I trust myself to do this going forward.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.920]   Secondly, the issue here is going to be similar to what I talked to both Fahad and Jacob about.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.820]   You might just have too many projects and they might just actually be too hard.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.300]   So be very careful about that.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.440]   I think one project worked on consistently and slowly over time is going to in the end
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.200]   open up more opportunities and have more impact than multiple projects that you're trying
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.300]   to tackle in a frenzied burst.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.860]   So it's like sort of a key slow productivity principle here, work on fewer things.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.060]   So you might just have too many projects.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.420]   Again, you have this impatience of I'm young and there's so much I want to do and I have
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.580]   to make my mark and you don't realize just choose the one thing that you patiently start
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.540]   building your skill on.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.900]   It's frustrating maybe now when you're 22, but by the time you're 24, 25 and that's bearing
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.420]   fruit, the fruit is going to be so much riper and sweeter than if you had spilled that time
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:41.180]   instead just jumping from thing to thing, trying to jump from the latest idea to the
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180]   latest interest.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.940]   I mean, I knew someone like this in college, Jesse, and I kind of remember his name, but
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.300]   I'm not sure if I have his name right.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.980]   And maybe I should anonymize it anyways.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.140]   But I knew about him because he was my year of college, maybe he was a year younger, and
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.340]   he was the only other person I knew who was trying to write a book.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.020]   And so he had interest in books, but he had all these other interests as well.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:07.260]   Like he was interested in politics because Dartmouth is in Hanover, which is in New Hampshire.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.860]   So when the presidential season would come through, which happened twice when I was there,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.700]   everyone comes to New Hampshire because of the primaries, you get lots of political figures
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   coming through.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.980]   So he was also getting really involved in helping to like organize.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:24.660]   I believe it was a debate for the 2004 presidential election and he had this other project going
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660]   on.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660]   And so there was this real sense.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.740]   I remember, man, he's doing a lot of things.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:33.100]   Book writing was one of them, all these different projects, just the excitement of, he was very
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.520]   capable and all these different things that could make my market.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.700]   I was not that way.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   I was just writing.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.340]   I was doing my CS work and writing.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.860]   And that was my main thing outside of my schoolwork was just writing.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.340]   And I just, I wanted to write this book and do it well and then immediately turn around
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.340]   and sell another.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.780]   I just wanted to make my writing better and I was willing to put my time, just focus on
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.780]   that.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.340]   And so there's this point early on, we're both kind of working on books and he had a
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:05.100]   lot of other stuff going on, but all that stuff, I don't know what happened to it, but
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.420]   I just kept focusing on books.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.460]   And I wrote another book and I was a little bit better.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.180]   And then I took some time and wrote a third book, which was much better.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.900]   And then it set up my fourth book, which was a hardcover.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.300]   And now that has borne much more interesting fruit.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.100]   I have actually, it took me a long time, but I've developed myself into a writer who can
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.560]   have a career as a writer.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.500]   So in the moment when I was 20 or 21, it seemed maybe naively slow, like, I'm just going to
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.020]   work on this book and try to make it good.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.060]   I don't want to be distracted.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.880]   But looking back as a 41 year old, I said, man, I'm so glad I stayed focused on that
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.380]   because how much interesting stuff has making writing one of my two core focuses of my life
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.740]   really opened up.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:50.320]   So Lloyd had slowing down, doing less things, sticking with that in a sustainable pace over
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.300]   a long period of time.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.800]   That's typically what you want to be doing if your goal is either impact or opening up
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.420]   interesting opportunities in your life or some combination of those two.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.260]   That slow productivity approach is probably better.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.900]   So that might be what's going on as well as your mind is overwhelmed.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.900]   This is too much.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.320]   So we got mindset and we have your mind being reasonable.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.760]   So your mindset might be off.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   You need external power.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.980]   We fixed that through practice.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.800]   Your mind might be working perfectly fine and is making the reasonable observation that
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   now this is too much work.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.920]   We have too many things.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.380]   We can't possibly be making a difference in all of these.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.220]   We're beginning to conflict with each other.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.660]   So you might actually just have to think about doing less.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:32.020]   Actually focusing is one of the main messages in your student books, like where you tell
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.380]   people not to do like a thousand activities and stuff like that.
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:42.460]   In fact, I was reminded that, so I'm back at Dartmouth and I didn't really remember
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.460]   this till I got up there.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.220]   I was like, oh, I've been back a bunch of times over the course of the last couple of
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.660]   decades to give talks.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.100]   And one of the first talks I gave, there's an old poster of this I have somewhere in
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.100]   my basement.
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.100]   I'd forgotten about this.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.820]   I think it was a year out of college.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:02.380]   I came back to Dartmouth and gave a lecture to students there about navigating their student
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.700]   career.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.540]   And this was one of the big points I was making was do fewer things.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.540]   Do fewer things.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.780]   Do them really well.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:17.140]   You are much better off, for example, being the best student in the computer science department
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.060]   than you are being the student with the hardest schedule on campus.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.980]   I have three majors and I'm doing these impossible.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.380]   You're much better off saying I'm only a computer science student.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.380]   And in fact, I balance my computer science courses with easier courses and I take full
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.180]   advantage of independent studies and thesis studies where I can reduce my course load
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.400]   but still get credits.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.260]   And so my course load is very, very manageable.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.900]   And what I do is I take that energy to become the best student in those computer science
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.940]   classes.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.820]   That is way, way more valuable than I did a triple major.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.820]   Or I had really hard semesters.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.620]   No one cares how hard your semesters are.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.220]   Similarly, I wrote a book.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.620]   You know, I wrote a book for Random House.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.740]   It's going to get you much farther than I, you know, I had six different clubs.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.820]   You know how hard that was?
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.500]   I was a treasurer here and I ran this.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   I did this initiative.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.220]   No one's keeping track of that.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   No one cares.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.100]   I mean, they're like, yeah, you seem like a go getter.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.220]   But it doesn't catch their attention.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.020]   Like people care about the thing you do best.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.980]   So you're almost always better off making your best things as good as possible, which
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.740]   almost always requires doing less.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.100]   And this was again, this came out of my advocacy about student stress, which I did this like
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.780]   2004 to 2007 period.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.740]   I did a lot of this, a lot of talks all over the country about this.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:30.460]   And at the core of my advocacy about student stress was.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.020]   Students need to do much less.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.900]   This is a there's only so much that tactics and strategies and time management, they can
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.860]   only get you so far if you have too many courses and activities.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.460]   And then as a college student.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.020]   There's no real reason to do a lot of things because no one in your future is going to
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   care about that.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:54.060]   There is no college admissions officer type figure in your future who is going to pour
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.620]   over what you did at college and say how hard was their schedule?
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   Let's get letters.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.460]   They say this person was really impressive.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.820]   They worked on all these things.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.140]   How hard were their course, their course load?
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.460]   No one looks at that after college.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.340]   If you're trying to go to grad school, it's going to be a professor evaluating your application.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.340]   What do you want to know?
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.340]   Where did you go to school?
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.340]   Have you done your research in your major?
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.700]   Have you demonstrated you can do research?
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   That's all they care.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.700]   It's all they care about.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.420]   They're not going to look at your oh my God, they had three.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.660]   This is a really complicated schedule or look at these activities.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   They could care less.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.660]   You're going to work for a company.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.140]   Typically, they want to know where did you go to school?
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.780]   What was your GPA?
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.780]   How they do in the interview.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.820]   That's what they care about.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.220]   You know, and again, we're going to see this again and again.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.220]   Go to law school.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.220]   What do they care about?
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.460]   Here's LSAT GPA.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.580]   You can look up the grid.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.680]   School by school.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   This LSAT requires this GPA to have a high chance of getting in for basically every school
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.380]   except for maybe Yale.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.380]   That's what you need to do.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.380]   I have this grade point average.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.840]   I need this LSAT score practice till I get it.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   Now I can get it right.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.700]   No one is going to be pouring over your resume to see how hard your schedule is or how stressed
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.700]   you were.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.120]   That became a big core of my student advocacy.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.060]   Stress advocacy was avoid unforced error students.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.040]   Create schedules and loads that are very manageable and then do what you do really well.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   Do a small number of things well.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.640]   It's such a more sustainable strategy.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.120]   And in the end, opens up more opportunities than I did a lot of hard.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   I had a hard schedule and did a lot of things okay.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.680]   So that was a big part of my schedule.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.560]   You know, the other part of my, this is going off tangent, Jesse, but I was talking about
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.320]   this at a student event the other week up at Dartmouth.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.240]   We kind of brought up all this.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.400]   I dredged up all of this stuff I used to do around student stress advocacy way back when.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:40.760]   And I remember the other thing, the other thing that came up often was when student
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.480]   stress became a big issue, especially at the high school level, the response, and I think
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.640]   this is still sort of an instinct we have right now.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:56.680]   The response was all of these Ivy League educated commentators who are writing about this thinking
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:03.000]   like Alexander Robbins or Denise Pope would then turn to these aspirational students who
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.560]   were stressing themselves out, trying to get into like an Ivy League school and say, guys,
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.320]   there's more to life than going to a good school.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.600]   Now just chill out about it.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.960]   And this was completely falling flat because here they were with their Stanford and Yale
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.760]   degrees saying like, well, I did it and I'm doing this kind of cool stuff and I'm kind
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.240]   of famous, but like, just go to the, you're so you're kind of, in fact, you're flawed
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.840]   and especially your parents are flawed for pushing you to actually want to come here.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.040]   Just temper your ambition.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:33.160]   So it was very much this pull up the drawbridge behind you type of mentality that just wasn't
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   working.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.720]   The students who were most stressed, if you came to them with your Ivy League diploma
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.160]   on the wall and said, there's more to life than going to an Ivy League, they would 100%
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.520]   tune you out because they would say, I disagree.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.760]   You look like you're doing something cool.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.440]   I want to do something cool like that.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:53.080]   If the only thing you can offer me is be less ambitious, I'm sorry, but I'm going to ignore
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.520]   you and go back to whatever's caused me all the stress and causing all these troubles.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.080]   And so I was also back then, this 2005, 2006 period, this lone voice out there in the student
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   stress debates.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.480]   And this is when they really picked up speed when the millennial demographic bump hit up
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.000]   against limited college admission slot, when the common application became widespread and
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.800]   now you could apply to 50 colleges pretty easily.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.040]   This is when it acceptance rates plummeted, right?
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.940]   So the two thousands, early two thousands, this is when it became a real problem.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.960]   And I was out there, you know, as a lone voice among these other voices saying, well, you
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.280]   have to offer students is an alternative path to their ambitions.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.680]   You have to keep the ambition in the question.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   Okay.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   You want to go to a really good school.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.120]   I'm not going to try to talk you out of that.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.020]   I mean, I want you to know it's okay if that doesn't happen, but I'm not going to tell
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:44.280]   you you're bad or your parents are flawed for thinking you want to go to Harvard or
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.880]   whatever, but let's talk about how you do that.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.800]   And actually this path of overloading yourself and just trying to grind it out is not very
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   successful.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.400]   There are alternative paths where you could be very interesting and have a good shot at
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.880]   these schools, but your life is very sustainable.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.900]   And I used to call it the Zen valedictorian strategy.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.760]   And I wrote a lot about it, talked a lot about it.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.840]   My third book is actually about this strategy.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:10.800]   I followed five kids who got into really good schools without being stressed and deconstructed.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.160]   How in the world did they do this?
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   Right.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.320]   And so I was the lone voice out there often that would say, I think it's completely fine.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.560]   You have to recognize and accept people's ambitions and then start giving them more
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.000]   sustainable strategies for pursuing those ambitions.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.440]   We're way off Loyal's question at this point, but it was this all, I was just thinking about
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   this.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.440]   I was talking to all these college students the other day.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.840]   We did a student dinner and I was talking to a lot of them about, cause they had just
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.520]   gone through this to get into Dartmouth.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.960]   I believe Dartmouth's acceptance right now is negative 2%.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.400]   Like they actually kick out a certain number of people each year.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.920]   You have to get, I think they get into an Ivy league school today.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:53.880]   You have to work really hard in STEM classes in high school, get to the head of those classes,
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:59.280]   use those technology to invent a time machine, then bring yourself back to 1997.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.920]   It's negative acceptance.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.840]   You actually have to go back in time to be accepted.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.840]   I think they try to reduce the number of students there every year.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.120]   I don't know.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.720]   That's all neither here nor there.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   I'm just in this mindset.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.680]   I don't know why I'm in this mindset again, but I guess Jesse, you caused all this by
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.680]   saying, I talk about focus in my student books.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.200]   I was like, yeah, like in my student books, I really was trying to just be very clear
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.840]   about here's how a lot of students do really well.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   And a lot of it's not doing too much being organized about what you do, but keeping your
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.960]   load manageable and actually it's a very sustainable path.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.120]   Not completely out of nowhere though, because I think we'll see this final question.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.840]   I think it's gonna be relevant to this final question.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   All right.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.240]   Last question from a CS student.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.680]   In a previous podcast, you mentioned not to work for 10 hours at a time.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.040]   Like many productivity YouTubers do.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.680]   Can you explain why not?
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:54.320]   These YouTubers are often the biggest names in YouTube productivity and seem like they're
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.480]   excellent students and are creating long-term deep life habits from it.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.320]   As long as you make sure to avoid shallow work, I was wondering why is working 10 hours
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.480]   a day a problem?
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.600]   Have you seen these videos, Jesse?
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   No.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   People have been sending them to me.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:15.260]   I've taken your advice even before I knew you about the no, you can't see any other
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.360]   videos on the homepage.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   So I only come-
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.320]   Yeah, the plugin that takes the recommendations off of YouTube.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.800]   By the way, I'm a big believer in that still.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.920]   YouTube is a great library.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.360]   It's a terrible television channel.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.880]   That's what I always say.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.640]   So to use it as a library, I want to learn how to do this thing.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.680]   I can search and find videos on how to replace the oil in my very particular type of car.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.840]   It's an excellent library.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.760]   Or I want to look up, I've heard about Cal Newport.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.880]   I like Cal Newport.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:48.080]   I know his podcast is on YouTube, so I can have that bookmarked.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.340]   And I'm going there to look up Cal Newport videos to see his podcast.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.340]   That's great.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:58.160]   To use it as a TV channel, let me just click on a recommendation and then see if the recommendations
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.800]   are more interesting than what I'm watching and click on those recommendations and sort
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.180]   of following those rabbit holes.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.680]   That is more dangerous.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:09.120]   But anyways, there's a whole productivity YouTube where these YouTubers do these over-the-top,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:16.400]   I think of it as a sort of nerd version of David Blaine productivity endurance challenges.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:22.880]   I guess it's time lapse, but 10 hours studying straight and they make it sort of heroic.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.440]   This often works well on YouTube.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:30.080]   If the thing you're doing is over the top, you take whatever emotional reaction that
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.520]   is relevant to that topic.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.320]   So you see someone well organized and studying well, and you're like, "Oh, I kind of have
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   an affinity for that.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   I want to be a better student."
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.480]   And then you show someone doing it for 10 hours, you push it over the top.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.240]   It takes that emotional response and pushes over the top.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.880]   That's engagement.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.960]   And people watch these videos and get really into it.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:53.040]   So it's a classic YouTube strategy being applied to the topic of productivity.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.040]   So why not study for 10 hours a day?
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.160]   You can see in the student's question, these are big names on YouTube.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.120]   These people are YouTube famous.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.320]   They seem like they're really good students.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   There's a clarity to it.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:09.200]   There's an extremeness to it, a sort of monastic discipline to all I do is study all day.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.600]   And I guess my answer to the CS student, it would be to turn the question back on you
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.400]   and say, "To what end?"
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.360]   So what are you trying to accomplish if you're working 10 hours a day on schoolwork?
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:27.520]   Well, you might say, "Well, then for sure I'll get into med school."
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   Okay.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.520]   So then what?
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   Well, okay.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.720]   So I could study 10 hours a day in med school so that I could graduate, top my class and
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.120]   get a really good residency.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   Okay.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   Well, then what?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.120]   Well, then I would work 10 hours a day so I could do research.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:46.000]   I could be the very best resident and get sort of an academic clinical position.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Okay.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Well, then what?
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.520]   Well, then I'd really want to do 10 hours because if I could fill every hour working
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.480]   on my medical research and clinician practice, I could move up really quickly and become
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.920]   an attending and get tenure at the associate university very quickly.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   It was like, all right, well, then what?
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:05.360]   Well, then I could, if I really worked 10 hours all day long, then I could probably
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:10.840]   become chair of this particular medical department and bring in all this different money and
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.800]   we could really expand the hospitals.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   And then what?
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:20.560]   You keep following this out and you look back and say, "All I've done is just work really
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.720]   hard."
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.680]   What about all the other elements of life?
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.840]   So like the, what, where is there in this point, some sort of victory where you say,
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.680]   now I can have a full, rich experience of life.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   It's just working for the sake of working because of what's next.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   Putting aside the fact that it's completely unsustainable and these YouTubers don't work
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   10 hours all the time.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.520]   They do, again, it's like looking at David Blaine, frees himself into a block of ice.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.040]   He doesn't spend most days frozen to a block of ice, but it got a lot of engagement when
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.400]   he did that as a stunt for a television special.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.560]   They're not spending their day doing this all the time.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.680]   It's not a sustainable way to live, but even if it was in general, this is like, let me
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.080]   grind and work all of my hours so I can get the next thing really, you know, get to the
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.360]   next level at the very highest level.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.880]   It's not sustainable because it keeps going.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.160]   Now there are some exceptions to this.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:13.120]   Like sure, some professional caliber Olympic athletes do this, but they're doing this for
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:17.280]   a very narrow window because they have until they're what, 33 before they have to move
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.580]   on and live the rest of your life.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.880]   It's very different if you're training for the Olympics like this with this level of
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.960]   intensity because it's a in dated thing.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.400]   But if you're talking about your career as a student and your professional career, there's
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.000]   nowhere there, there's no place where that ends essentially until you die.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.080]   What type of life is that?
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.700]   So why don't you work for 10 hours a day?
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.840]   Because it's not living.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:45.660]   It's a sort of parody of a workism if I'm going to take a term from Derek Thompson.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.800]   So what works better?
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:54.440]   Social productivity, working with good focus and good organization on things that matter
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.680]   consistently and systematically over time.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.200]   This can produce work of real impact of real meaning.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.600]   It can open up all sorts of interesting opportunities in your life.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.920]   It can allow you to do and accomplish very competitive things.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   And it's compatible with a well-rounded life.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.720]   And it's compatible with I don't just work all the time.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.080]   I'm not just always stressed out.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:16.620]   I'm not just always overwhelmed and trying to keep up or, or compete with someone else.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:22.680]   It often also produces in a lot of fields, better results, right?
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.040]   You don't see the very best novelists that are winning all the awards getting there because
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.120]   they spend more hours working on their novel every day.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.280]   No, it's this sort of slow and steady work on their writing.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.680]   They're very careful and intentional about their time.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.640]   They think, they read, they walk, they integrate and they come back and write and you get really
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.040]   great, you know, it's where you can get a sort of wholesome whitehead is out of the
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.640]   slow development of real talent, not out of I worked, I wrote 12 hours each day and the
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.400]   other writers are only writing six hours each day.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.680]   Now I think there's a comfort in this for very ambitious young people because it makes
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.800]   you think, it gives you a very simple framework.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   I turned this knob of hours.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.200]   The higher the knob you turn up on hours, the more successful you'll be.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.840]   Most people aren't going to turn the knob past this point because they're weak.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.920]   I'm not weak.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.160]   If I'm willing to take the pain, it's very simple.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.400]   What I need to do is just hard.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.600]   It's just keeping my hand in a metaphorical ice bucket longer than you did.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   I like this.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.280]   I'm going to do 10 hours.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   You're only going to do four.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.400]   I'll be more successful.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.920]   So it makes success seem much more controllable.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.800]   It's just a matter of, of raw will.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.680]   But again, that's not the reality.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.560]   Great work, innovative work in academia, in the arts, in business or business strategy
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.240]   has its busy periods, but is not built upon.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.800]   I have to be working all the time.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.320]   So I just think it's no real way.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   It's no real way to live.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320]   I just say this.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.280]   So I come back to my original question to what end, what comes next after your 10 hours
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.680]   a day as a student, what comes next after your 10 hours a day as the investment Baker
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   junior associate, because you took that job because it was the most competitive, the hardest
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.680]   one to get.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.960]   What comes next after you get managing director at the investment bank?
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.840]   What comes next after you go off to start your own hedge fund?
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.960]   What comes next after you hit the billion dollar valuation?
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.800]   I mean, there's always things you could be overworking yourself towards, but again, to
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.120]   what end, what comes next?
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.360]   These are the questions I always come back to.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.960]   So I think it's a stunt what these productivity YouTubers are doing.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.160]   I've spent my entire life in professional academia.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.240]   The smartest people don't do that.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.000]   They work hard and undergraduate.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   They don't, right?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.480]   I mean, because it's not that hard.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.160]   They work hard in periods and other periods there and thinking periods, they have other
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.840]   types of things going on.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.760]   So I'm just not this idea that you're going to somehow just, I love the simplicity of
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.600]   it, but this idea that you're going to somehow just out raw number everyone else.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.080]   And that's where your success is going to come from.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.480]   It just is not sustainable.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.840]   Goes against the deep life that we talk about here.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:52.840]   It's way out of balance over the top and really not the right way in my mind to build a life
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.160]   of intentionality and depth.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.320]   All that's new, Jesse, this like work 10 hours thing.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.160]   It's because it worked on YouTube.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.000]   And I think for young people, they see it.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.200]   They don't realize how new it is.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.320]   It's someone just figured this out a few years ago that is very compelling content to be
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.880]   like, man, I just studied 10 hours.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.320]   And they, you watch them doing it.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320]   You're like, man, they did it.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   They stuck with it.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.800]   And look at that's great.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   It just seems so simple.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.360]   It's like the productivity equivalent of David Goggins doing, just ran all day long or did
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.760]   pushups till my arm fell off.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   You know, it's like when we heard Mr. Beast talk about, if you want a compelling video
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.720]   and you don't have a lot of money, you can put together paper clips for multiple football
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.160]   fields and people will watch it.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   Yep.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.000]   Or what was his, how high can he count?
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.640]   He counted to like a million or something and it took him 12 hours.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   It works on YouTube.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.560]   It's not actually a strategy for productivity.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.000]   It's a strategy for getting good views on a YouTube video.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.640]   So maybe our YouTube videos will be the counterpoint for the youth out there or old man videos.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.200]   I want to move on to something interesting, but first let me mention a sponsor that makes
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.440]   this show possible.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.880]   That is our friends at element.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.960]   L M N T element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything you need and nothing you
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   don't.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.920]   It needs lots of salt, but no sugar.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   Why salt?
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.280]   Because you need electrolytes as part of keeping a good, healthy balance.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.560]   So if you are dehydrated partially because let's say you've been talking all day or you've
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.240]   been sweating a lot because you live in DC, but the humidity is roughly all the percent,
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.920]   I don't know the exact term, but it's just terrible here right now.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.440]   You lose a lot of liquids, including a lot of salts.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.600]   You can't just drink water.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.000]   You need water with electrolytes.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.440]   That's what element specializes in as a science backed ratio of 1000 milligrams sodium with
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.400]   200 milligrams potassium and 60 milligrams magnesium, but no junk, no sugar, no coloring,
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.440]   no artificial ingredients, no gluten, no fillers, no BS.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.920]   I also really like the taste.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.720]   I'm a big element fan.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.600]   This is what I use after my workouts is what I use after my long thinking walks, especially
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.440]   in the summer.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.160]   I like the strawberry, no watermelon, not strawberry.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.640]   So a watermelon flavor is my favorite.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.520]   They were a sponsor early in the show and I got hooked on it by the samples they sent
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520]   us.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.280]   So I had been buying and using element on my own until they returned as a sponsor.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.080]   So I was happy to have them return because this is one of these products.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   It's what I use.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080]   It's open the packet, add it to a water bottle.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   If I'm really sweaty, I do the whole packet.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.160]   If I'm somewhere in between, maybe I'll do half a packet and I can, I feel as if I can
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.280]   tell the difference, but I'd like that there's no sugar.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.680]   So I don't have to worry about drinking it unlike other types of sports drinks.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.920]   So it's perfectly suited if you're on a keto, low carb or paleo diet, or if you just don't
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.880]   want a bunch of sugar, but you do feel like you need more than water after some heavy
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   activity.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.720]   So right now element is offering a free sample pack with any purchase.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.180]   That's eight single serving packets free with any element order.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.100]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors or share element with a salty friend.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.120]   Get yours at drink element.com/deep.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.920]   This deal is only available through my link.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.600]   You need that slash deep to get the free sample pack.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:12.240]   So you must go to D R I N K L M N T.com/deep.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.680]   Keep in mind, this is totally risk-free.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.860]   If you don't like it, you can just share it with a friend and they will give you your
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   money back.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860]   No questions asked.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.040]   You have nothing to lose.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.900]   Speaking of exercise, and I also want to talk about our friends at my body tutor.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.320]   I've known Adam Gilbert, my body tutors founder for many years.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:34.760]   He was the original fitness advice guy on my study hacks blog.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:39.820]   His company, my body tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:44.220]   in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.860]   You sign up for my body tutor, you're matched with a coach who helps you develop a fitness
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:55.940]   and nutrition plan based around your goals, your lifestyle, your context, you in particular.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.580]   And then you check in with this coach using an app on your phone every single day.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.240]   That's where you get the consistency.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.140]   There's another human in the loop who you feel a responsibility to, to follow the plan
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:13.180]   and who can help you adjust on the fly as life circumstances necessitate it.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:17.260]   This is why I think my body tutor has been such a successful program is because it gets
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.140]   results.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.540]   Information is easy.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.700]   Follow through is hard.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.100]   My body tutor solves that problem.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.620]   So if you're serious about getting fit, Adam is giving deep question listeners $50 off
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.620]   their first month.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.300]   All you have to do is mention this podcast when you join.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.100]   Just mention deep questions when you join and they'll give you $50 off.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.860]   All right, Jesse, our final segment is something interesting.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:45.540]   This is where we talk about something interesting that you, my listeners have sent into my interesting
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:49.940]   that calnewpork.com email address.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.100]   So I want to load my password.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:59.300]   So I'm going to load up now a short post that one of you sent in that I thought was interesting.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.420]   Okay, so here we go.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   Here's the post.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.500]   This was posted on I suppose, LinkedIn.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   I have it up on the screen.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:13.860]   So if you're watching youtube.com/calnewporkmedia episode 256 or the deeplife.com episode 256.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.980]   All right, this is about Harrison Ford.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.060]   I thought this was appropriate because there's a new Indiana Jones movie in the theater.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.780]   So I'll be taking my boys to shortly.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.780]   Here's what this post says.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.740]   Before he was Han Solo or Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford was a carpenter.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:34.000]   In 1964, Ford moved to Hollywood to become an actor.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.020]   But I arrived on a metaphoric bus full of people who had the same ambition, he said.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.580]   So he came up with this plan to prevail over the competition.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.860]   As Ford spent time around the other aspiring actors on that metaphoric bus, he became aware
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.100]   of something.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.380]   Most of them were in a hurry.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:54.380]   They're in a hurry to make it or to make lots of money, or to prove something to someone.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.300]   Whatever the reason, most run a tight timeline.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.100]   So Form's plan was to do the opposite, to lengthen his timeline.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.940]   To do so, Ford said, I had to have another source of income.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:02.940]   So I became a carpenter.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:06.140]   By doing carpentry, he explained, I was able to wait it out.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.660]   As the years went by, the attrition rate eliminated many of those people from the competition
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:15.060]   pool until finally, there were only a few of us left on the bus from the entering class.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.300]   I always saw life that way.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.060]   You just have to find a way to stick it out to prevail.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:26.460]   All right, I like that story because it's a great vignette of slow productivity in action.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.980]   There's something that's both effective and sustainable by working on a small number of
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:34.620]   things over a long period of time consistently.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:41.100]   This is the definition of internal powered goals, the theme that unifies this episode.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.500]   I'm sticking with this, even if I'm not excited about it every moment, even if my motivation
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.300]   goes up and down, even if my success or failures have periods where one is big and the other's
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.420]   down and that's flops back and forth.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.980]   I'm going through a hard period now.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:56.740]   I consistently make progress.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.540]   And not just working blindly, but really getting feedback, adjusting.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.460]   You can imagine Harrison Ford struggling with roles early on, pivoting when he sees a different
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.300]   type of role, seeing he needs a special type of training.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.840]   It's this relentless return.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.900]   What can I improve here?
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.900]   What's not working?
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.060]   How can I adjust my trajectory?
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.400]   You're making adjustments.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   You're letting evidence come in.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.940]   You're learning more, but forward momentum always continues, steps every day.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.560]   So you're moving in the right direction, adjusting your path, always moving.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.420]   This more often than not is what unlocks really interesting impact and interesting opportunities.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.140]   This slow productivity approach, a small number of things that through internal power you
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.860]   keep pursuing over time, just relentlessly.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.580]   I'm sticking with this, updating how I do it, but sticking with it over time.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.420]   Small number of things done really well, a reasonable sustainable pace really is, I think,
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:55.860]   a very sustainable strategy for a deep life, a very sustainable strategy for eventually
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.500]   doing achieving deep accomplishments.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.020]   So I thought that was a good story to end on.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.180]   Productivity doesn't have to be fast.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.580]   Productivity doesn't require constant intakes of motivation, inspiration.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:15.780]   Productivity doesn't require these 10-hour YouTube productivity, YouTuber style binges
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.860]   of I'm just out white knuckling everyone else.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:23.100]   Sometimes it's as boring as Harrison Ford said, "I'm just going to take my time and
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.660]   keep working on this craft, taking feedback, adjust, taking feedback, adjust, having a
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:33.460]   second trade to support myself until finally American graffiti happens, then Star Wars
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.500]   happens, then Indiana Jones happens, and the whole thing breaks open."
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.620]   So sometimes slowing down is the right way to actually make it farther down the path,
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.620]   as paradoxical as that can seem.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:48.060]   All right, so that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.060]   Thank you for tuning in.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.380]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:56.380]   I'll be returning to the Deep Work HQ headquarters north for another month or so, but the show
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.060]   will, as they say, go on.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.140]   So I look forward to doing the next show and seeing you then.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.540]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:08.340]   [MUSIC]
