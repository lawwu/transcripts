[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   - Is there an aspect of human existence
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.560]   that is meaningful only because we're mortal?
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.000]   - Well, every waking moment,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.780]   we don't think about it this way,
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.260]   but every waking moment, actually,
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.140]   we are aware of our death and our mortality.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.200]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   When you go to college,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.780]   you realize that you are in a period of time
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.240]   where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.760]   And after that, you'll retire, and then you'll die.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.200]   And so even as a youth, even as a child,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.480]   without even thinking about it,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.760]   you are aware of your own death
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   'cause it sets limits to your lifespan.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.120]   I gotta graduate from high school.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.760]   I gotta graduate from college.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760]   Why?
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.240]   Because you're gonna die.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.800]   Because unless you graduate from high school,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.560]   unless you graduate from college,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.160]   you're not gonna enter old age with enough money
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.360]   to retire and then die.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.560]   And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.820]   because it affects every aspect of your being.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.160]   The fact that you go to high school, college,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   get married, have kids, there's a clock,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.400]   a clock ticking even without your permission.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160]   - It gives a sense of urgency.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.960]   Do you yourself, I mean,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.920]   there's so much excitement and passion
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.460]   in the way you talk about physics
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.880]   and the way you talk about technology in the future.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.320]   Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.500]   Do you think about this clock that's ticking?
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.680]   - Well, I try not to
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.500]   because it then begins to affect your behavior.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.840]   You begin to alter your behavior
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.200]   to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.780]   So let's talk about youth
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.960]   and then let's talk about death, okay?
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.720]   When I interview scientists on radio,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.880]   I often ask them, what made the difference?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.320]   How old were you?
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   What changed your life?
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.960]   And they always say more or less the same thing.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.520]   No, these are Nobel Prize winners,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.960]   directors of major laboratories,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.700]   very distinguished scientists.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.760]   They always say, when I was 10.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.380]   When I was 10, something happened.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.640]   It was a visit to the planetarium.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.320]   It was a telescope.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.820]   For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760]   it was the chemistry kit.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.800]   For Isidore Rabi, it was a book about the planets.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.040]   For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.760]   Something happened which gives them this existential shock.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   'Cause you see, before the age of 10,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.400]   everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.920]   That's your universe, mommy and daddy.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.400]   Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.560]   what's beyond mommy and daddy?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.480]   And that's when you have this epiphany.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   When you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.280]   A universe of discovery.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   You still remember that shock
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.720]   that you felt gazing at the universe.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.280]   And then you hit the greatest destroyer
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.440]   of scientists known to science.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.360]   The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.800]   is junior high school.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.760]   When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.640]   It's all over.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.520]   Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   I mean, you like that nerdy stuff
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.720]   and your friends shun you.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.480]   All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   And science is made boring.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.360]   You know, Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.920]   when he was a child,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.440]   his father would take him into the forest.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   And the father would teach him everything about birds.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.880]   Why they're shaped the way they are.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   Their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000]   Everything about birds.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   So one day a bully comes up
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.920]   to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.320]   hey, dick, what's the name of that bird over there?
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   Well, he didn't know.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   He knew everything about that bird except its name.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.880]   So he said, I don't know.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then the bully said, what's the matter, dick?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   You stupid or something?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.680]   And then in that instant, he got it.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.040]   He got it.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.960]   He realized that for most people,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.920]   science is giving names to birds.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   That's what science is.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.720]   You know, lots of names of obscure things.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.640]   Hey, people say, you're smart.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.720]   You're smart.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.560]   You know all the names of the dinosaurs.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.480]   You know all the names of the plants.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.800]   No, that's not science at all.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   That's what science is all about.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.440]   My favorite quote from Einstein is that,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.600]   "Unless you can explain the theory to a child,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.720]   "the theory is probably worthless."
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.640]   Meaning that all great theories are not big words.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   All great theories are simple concepts,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   principles, basic physical pictures.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.440]   Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.080]   rocket ships, and locomotives.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.960]   Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.120]   and spinning wheels and things like that.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.720]   That's what physics and science is all about,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.400]   not memorizing things.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.800]   And that stays with you for the rest of your life.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.560]   So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.960]   when they sit back, they still remember.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.440]   They still remember that flush,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.960]   that flush of excitement they felt
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.840]   with that first telescope,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.560]   that first moment when they encountered the universe.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   That keeps them going.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.080]   That keeps them going.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   [ Silence ]
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   [ Silence ]
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   [ Silence ]
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.140]   you
