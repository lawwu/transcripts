[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   And over the last few years, I think there was this issue of GPU production, right? So even
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.440]   companies that had the money to pay for the GPUs couldn't necessarily get as many as they wanted
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.520]   because there were all these supply constraints. Now I think that's sort of getting less. So now
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.880]   I think you're seeing a bunch of companies think about, "Wow, we should just like really invest a
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.840]   lot of money in building out these things." And I think that that will go for some period of time.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.240]   There is a capital question of like, "Okay, at what point does it stop being worth it to put
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.640]   the capital in?" But I actually think before we hit that, you're going to run into energy
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.720]   constraints, right? Because I just, I mean, I don't think anyone's built a gigawatt single
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.600]   training cluster yet. I mean, just to, I guess, put this in perspective, I think a gigawatt,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.480]   it's like around the size of like a meaningful nuclear power plant only going towards training
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.640]   a model. And then you run into these things that just end up being slower in the world, like
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.360]   getting energy permitted is like a very heavily regulated government function. And if you're
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.280]   talking about building large new power plants or large build-outs and then building transmission
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.240]   lines that cross other private or public land, that is just a heavily regulated thing. So you're
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   talking about many years of lead time. So if we wanted to stand up just some massive facility
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.400]   to power that, I think that that's a very long-term project. I think we would probably build
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.640]   out bigger clusters than we currently can if we could get the energy to do it. So I think that's
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   fundamentally money bottlenecked in the limit. Like if you had a trillion dollars.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.280]   I think it's time, right? But it depends on how far the exponential curves go, right? Like I think
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.920]   a number of companies are working on, you know, right now I think a lot of data centers are on
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.480]   the order of 50 megawatts or a hundred megawatts, or like a big one might be 150 megawatts. Okay.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.560]   So you take a whole data center and you fill it up with just all the stuff that you need to do
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   for training and you build the biggest cluster you can. I think that's kind of, I think a bunch
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   of companies are running at stuff like that. But then when you start getting into building
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   a data center, that's like 300 megawatts or 500 megawatts or a gigawatt. I just, I mean,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.560]   just no one has built a single gigawatt data center yet. So I think it will happen, right?
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.520]   I mean, this is only a matter of time, but it's not going to be like next year. It's one of the
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.080]   trickiest things in the world to plan around is when you have an exponential curve, how long does
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   it keep going for? And I think it's likely enough that it will keep going, that it is worth investing
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.840]   the tens or, you know, a hundred billion plus in building the infrastructure to assume that if that
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.600]   kind of keeps going, you're going to get some really amazing things that are just going to
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.080]   make amazing products. But I don't think anyone in the industry can really tell you that it will
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.960]   continue scaling at that rate for sure. Right. In general, you know, in history, you hit bottlenecks
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.160]   at certain points. And now there's so much energy on this that maybe those bottlenecks get knocked
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.960]   over pretty quickly. But I don't think that this is like something that can be quite as magical as
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.480]   just like, okay, you get a level of AI and you get a bunch of capital and you put it in. And then
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.160]   like all of a sudden the models are just going to kind of like, it just like, I think you do
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.320]   hit different bottlenecks along the way.
