[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's always great to hear from our international listeners and we have a follow-up to the recent
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   Burger King episode and it comes from Grant who lives and ministers in North Africa. He
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.200]   asks, "Pastor John, I'm a Christian worker in a Muslim country and a few nights ago I
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.720]   was catching up on APJ episodes while cooking my dinner. I found myself affirming everything
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.800]   you said in episode 394 on Burger King until I looked into my frying pan with horror. All
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.520]   the meat here is halal, prepared according to Muslim law, whether purchased at a grocery
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.220]   store, from a butcher, or eaten in a local home. All available meat is slaughtered by
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.380]   praying Allah's name while the animals face towards Mecca. Often there is even a stamp
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.300]   on the food verifying it as halal. I have pondered over this and am baffled, knowing
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.800]   that both the Muslim Allah is a misconception of God and that sharing meals with locals
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   is a key part of missionary work. What might be a wise course of action both here in a
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   Muslim context and in the homes of Muslim friends stateside?"
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:17.060]   "To my knowledge, the halal preparation of meat by Muslims only makes it permissible
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:30.040]   to eat. It doesn't make the eating of it an act of worship. Haram means meat is forbidden,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.720]   work is forbidden, but halal simply means this has been duly and properly slaughtered
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.760]   and the blood has been handled correctly and it is permissible to eat. When we apply the
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.480]   Bible's teaching about meat offered to idols, it seems to me there are two ways that the
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.240]   Christian is free to eat halal meat. I better defer to others who know the situation better
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.440]   than I do, but let me give my sense of how this is permitted. So first, here's the
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.840]   key passage. Let me just read through it and make some comments as we go. So this is 1
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.960]   Corinthians 10, 18-28. "Consider the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   participants in the altar?" So here's a real sacrifice, a real sacrificial ceremony,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   including priests and offerers who bring the sacrifice. They eat together. This is real
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.920]   worship being described here. Verse 19, "What do I imply then? That food offered to idols
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.200]   is anything or that an idol is anything? No, I imply that what pagan sacrifice they offer
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.160]   to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.280]   drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the Lord's table and
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.600]   the table of demons. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?"
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.840]   So up till now, it seems to me, he's saying there is a situation when eating what pagan
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.560]   sacrifice would be participating with demons, sharing the table of demons, sharing the drink
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.160]   of demons. And now the question is, what situation is that? And how can we avoid it? Verse 23,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360]   "All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor." So there's
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.240]   the principle. Now here's the specific case. He says, verse 25, "Eat whatever is sold in
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.680]   the market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For the earth is
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.320]   the Lord's and the fullness thereof. If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.200]   you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.040]   the ground of conscience." So this is my comment now. Our default position is that all things
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.520]   are lawful for us to eat, and even if they were offered in sacrifice to demons, we may
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   eat since neither they, our hosts, nor we are turning this supper into a participation
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.240]   in the worship. It's not the meat that defiles, it's the heart intention to affirm and idol.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.000]   Then verse 28, "But if someone says to you, 'This has been offered in sacrifice,' then
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience."
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.760]   In other words, if your guest turns the supper that you're now going to share with him into
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.240]   a worship service, expecting you to participate in the meaning that he is now attaching to
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.960]   the meat that was offered, then you politely decline. So it seems to me that there are
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:18.760]   two reasons that halal preparation does not rule out halal meat for Christians to eat.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.320]   Number one, the slaughter does not seem to be a formal worship event which turns the
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.160]   eating of the meat into a participation in worship. Now if I'm wrong about that, then
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.280]   those who know better would apply the principle appropriately, but that's what it seems to
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   me. It's more of a ritual obedience to the letter of the law that makes the meats permissible,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.920]   slaughtered in a certain way. So the slaughter is not making the eating of the meat into
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.280]   an act of worship. It keeps it from being a sin as far as a Muslim is concerned. So
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.440]   joining with a Muslim in eating halal foods is not joining in an act of worship to Allah.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   Here's the second reason for being free to eat halal foods, is that even if they were
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:20.040]   offered in an act of worship to Allah, this would only be a hindrance to Christians eating
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   it if the Muslim hosts at the supper said, made clear, that the sharing in this food
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.220]   is a sharing in the worship of Allah. And I think that is wrong, joining a Muslim in
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.080]   worshipping Allah, because what a Muslim means by Allah and what a Muslim does in worship
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.600]   is radically different from what a Christian does in approaching God through Jesus Christ.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.240]   So my counsel to Grant is, you're free. You're free to eat halal foods at home and you're
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   free to have Muslims over and serve it and you're free to go to their house and eat it,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.760]   because I think Paul has addressed a situation incredibly similar to yours and solved it
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   that way.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.960]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Grant, for the question. It's always great to hear
