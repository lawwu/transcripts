[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.560]   OK.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280]   I think we're going to get started
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.320]   on our questions and answers.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.040]   Jesse will be joining us shortly.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   Here he is.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   Come on down.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.680]   I think one thing--
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.360]   I think we'll start with the question of,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   for people who are saving and investing now,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   how do they balance their priorities, saving
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.760]   for retirement, maybe saving for kids' college,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.120]   for a home purchase, for their emergency fund?
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.920]   People have different priorities.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.960]   The house is the one thing that you can buy and enjoy,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.400]   and it generally goes up in value.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.560]   Typically, I tell people to put their retirement ahead
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.520]   of the kid's college education.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.240]   That's just my own personal viewpoint.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.000]   There's a lot of discussion about funding 529
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.240]   should the kid have skin in their game.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.880]   My answer was not a very good one.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.720]   My parents paid for my college.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.200]   I paid for my son's college.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.640]   So you kind of have to have the discussion with the client
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.480]   about what their priorities are.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.400]   And sometimes I try to shift their priorities,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.520]   but ultimately, they have to agree to it.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I also love the idea of building that kind of $1,000,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.040]   like just have like $1,000 at some point that
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.120]   is easily accessible.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.000]   I love that idea.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But my priority system would be get to your magic number.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   Get to that savings rate number for your future self.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   I mean, it wasn't until I actually sat across
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   from people who could not retire,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.280]   and I realized that the pain of that
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.760]   is so severe that it cannot be offset by anything purchased
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.320]   along the way, meaning that people would do anything
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.040]   to go back and change the fact that they had not
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.960]   saved enough over those decades to be able to stop working.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.600]   So I'm sure someday one person will
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   be able to give me something else that they could have
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.920]   bought that would have been more important than the ability
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.080]   to stop working, but I still have not found that yet.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   So I always put that as the number one ranking.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800]   And then you can kind of be in and out of credit card debt.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.160]   Fancy free, don't save for the kids' college,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.640]   take out tons of credit card debt and student loan debt.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.080]   I guess that's fine, and it works,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.480]   but maybe you won't be living and maximizing your happiness
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   and utility with money.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.640]   But I say just get that priority done.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   And then if you look at my pay yourself first kind
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   of hierarchy, then second, get three to six months
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.520]   of emergency savings set aside.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   You can take about five years sometimes
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.200]   for people to build that.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.760]   And then I believe in setting up squirrel funds.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.800]   And so you can do that either with YNAB.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   We have a lot of clients that use
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.840]   that tool that simulates those different buckets,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   or you can actually set up your own savings
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   buckets at your bank account.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960]   Call them different things-- vacation, home repairs,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.240]   car repairs.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.280]   I have a clothing savings, just all the pet savings.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.640]   Oh my god, do you know how--
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.480]   don't get a pet.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.600]   Forget college savings, y'all.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.080]   I just took my dog in.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.720]   He got Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   We're running about $3,000 so far.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.840]   And then I heard another guy pay $4,000 at the register.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.200]   And another person flinched when they said $600.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.160]   It's no-- it is crazy.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.760]   Don't own a pet.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.840]   There's your kid's college education right there.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.240]   It's cute.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.680]   Ran over.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720]   I don't know.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.080]   The insurance-- the house always wins, right?
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.280]   I know, with pet insurance, house always wins.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.160]   This is true.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.760]   But please don't make that decision.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.440]   SC, I've got to disagree with you.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.200]   Dogs are wonderful.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.640]   So that goes back to Jesse and investing thoughtfully
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.360]   for what's important to you, right?
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   Yeah, I also was going to say to get rid of your dogs.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.120]   So--
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.880]   No, that was a fantastic demonstration
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.120]   of different priorities.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.360]   I have nothing else to add.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.440]   I'm starting with the emergency fund.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.920]   So how should I invest my emergency fund?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.560]   I mean, I am not nearly as experienced in the investing
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.800]   side as these three are.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.420]   But it obviously needs to be liquid, safe, quickly
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.800]   accessible.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.720]   Check those boxes.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   I think that money market funds are
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.560]   good for your emergency fund.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.920]   But I also-- for people who are in a very high tax state,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   you might want to use a treasury money market fund or just
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.160]   treasury bills.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.960]   Just buy T-bills and roll three-month T-bills
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.520]   because you don't have to pay state income tax on that.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.400]   Something very conservative.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.120]   Unless you have access--
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.720]   I mean, the stock funds are liquid.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.160]   So access to cash is more important than cash.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.440]   And how much should be an emergency fund?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.920]   I'm not a six-months or anything like that.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   If you work for the government, if you're
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.680]   an endowed college professor, your job
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.400]   is a whole lot more stable than if you're
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.800]   working for a startup company.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.960]   So how much should be in there, it depends.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   Like I said, the answer to just about every question,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.880]   it depends.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.520]   Couple of related questions about 401(k)s.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.560]   Should people prioritize Roth 401(k)s or regular pre-tax 401(k)s?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.240]   And where does the solo 401(k) fit in?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.160]   Oh, I love solo 401(k)s.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.360]   Who asked for that?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.280]   Great.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.200]   OK, so generally, if you ask me, should I
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.000]   do Roth or pre-tax in my 401(k), I say yes.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.640]   I'm not going to go to the mat on this.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.480]   But generally, if you're kind of younger
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.560]   and you're not at your earnings potential,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560]   you're not making very much, choose the Roth.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.320]   And then if you're at a higher income--
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.400]   no?
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.840]   I'm 100% in agreement.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.480]   I'm shaking no.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.800]   You stole exactly what I was going to say.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   OK, I was like, I don't want to disagree with you here.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.640]   I agree with you on your network theory.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.720]   I agree with you.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.120]   Don't worry about it.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.240]   So anyway, that's something I wouldn't
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.640]   lose too much sleep over.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.000]   A solo 401(k) is a really wonderful tool.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.920]   If you own your own business, it's great.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.400]   So I own a salsa dancing nightclub.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   And I think we're the only nightclub in America
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.280]   that has a 401(k).
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.760]   And we do.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.720]   We have a solo 401(k) on our nightclub income.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.880]   So you, too, can set up a solo 401(k).
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.320]   There are some really wonderful providers of it.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.760]   But I would suggest going to--
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.840]   I love Vanguard.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.520]   We have used theirs before.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.960]   But I like the smaller ones, like Employee Fiduciary
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.160]   or Ubiquity.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.640]   They make it a little easier for small business owners
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.420]   to set them up, rather than these bigger record keepers,
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.680]   like Vanguard White Labels, Ascensis.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.360]   These are just huge record keepers
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.840]   that are very unwieldy to work with.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.200]   So make it easier on yourself.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.720]   By the way, I have a solo--
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.360]   sorry.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.480]   I have a solo 401(k) and a solo Roth 401(k).
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.240]   And quite frankly, I'm not all that happy that Vanguard
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.640]   jettisoned and sold it.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.600]   Neither am I. I was with Vanguard with my solo 401(k).
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.040]   They went to Ascensure.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.540]   Ascensis.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.040]   Ascensis.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.040]   Ascensis.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.020]   And the very first thing I tried to do
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.960]   was I tried to make sure my allocation to my Roth
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.720]   was in stock, and my allocation to my pre-tax side
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.200]   was in fixed income.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.600]   Again, asset location.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.000]   And you couldn't do it there.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.160]   Unlike Vanguard, where you could have a Roth account
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.920]   and you could buy whatever you wanted in your Roth 401(k),
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.720]   and then they had the pre-tax side of your 401(k).
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.080]   You could buy bonds over there.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.720]   Unfortunately, with Ascensure, it's
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.920]   much more difficult to try to get it that way.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.240]   They said, well, you need to make two contributions.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.360]   And when you make your Roth contribution,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.480]   you put the fund that you want that to go into.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.180]   And then you get a weighted day, and then
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.400]   you make another contribution.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.600]   And then if that's going to go to your pre-tax side,
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.060]   then you buy a bond fund with that.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.480]   I said, all I want is to be able to look at it and say,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   what's in my Roth 401(k)?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.800]   What's in my pre-tax 401(k)?
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   So sorry to belabor this, but I'm
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.560]   not happy with that transfer.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.620]   And there have also been the issues with the census
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.120]   and people with the solo 401(k)s trying
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.680]   to move their money out.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.560]   I don't know if there's anyone in this room who
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.360]   has been in that bucket.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.400]   Fidelity doesn't have a Roth solo 401(k) though.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:17.960]   I expressed my dissatisfaction to the CEOs,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.920]   Salim Ramji, the Vanguard CEO.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.680]   And I got a call from a census, and they did fix it.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.960]   So if you raise it a little higher, they will fix it.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.760]   When the advice that you have all shared here,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.000]   thinking about the basics of saving,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.920]   making meaningful decisions about how to spend
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.040]   your money and investing, I'm wondering
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.760]   how your advice differs if you're
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.560]   talking to people who are starting out in their 20s
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.640]   versus there are people who are in their 40s and 50s,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.200]   and they're just kind of getting their act together.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.280]   I tell young people, as they get raises,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.480]   try to keep their lifestyle fairly constant.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   Raise it maybe with inflation so they're not
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.240]   cutting their lifestyle.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.880]   And I'm going to steal this from USC, pay yourself first.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.440]   There are some things that you can
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.920]   do in your youth with both of your normal knees
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   that you maybe can't do later in life.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.840]   And the only thing that we teach is
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.200]   that the context is most important to be thinking
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.520]   about spending in tenses instead of just spending in general.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.920]   So if you were to think of past tense spending,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.000]   it looks a lot like credit card debt.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   This is spending that happened in the past
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.280]   that you're still dealing with.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.520]   And present spending is pretty obvious what
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.480]   you might spend tonight.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.840]   And then future spending is obviously you
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.440]   with an eye toward your future self.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.360]   And there's no right answer to take the it depends kind
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.320]   of trump card answer.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.840]   But it's interesting, when you're
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.320]   working with someone that's 25, their idea of future is 30.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.280]   And it throws you off a little bit.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.360]   But they can still, when their context is correct,
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.480]   where they're feeling past student loan spending,
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.680]   they're feeling present wants, they're
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.960]   looking toward the future, they still, with that tension,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.720]   can arrive at a mix, a balance that works for them.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.880]   So there is no right answer.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.460]   But the only right thing to do is
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.560]   make sure that you hold all three spending
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.640]   tenses at the same time and start working on the answer.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.880]   And for the people who are first focusing on this now
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.400]   in their 40s or 50s, what are the most important messages
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.520]   you would have for them?
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:12:01.800]   I mean, again, I think it goes back to get your savings
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.840]   rate in order.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.760]   And it's much easier, obviously, to ask a 22-year-old just
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.800]   starting their first job to sign up for 10%.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.040]   And we're able to do that.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.560]   We have a movement in Arkansas getting every kid coming out
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.280]   of college the information to save 10%.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.400]   And they're just going out and showing us screenshots
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.600]   of their Vanguard accounts.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.080]   And it's really fun.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.280]   And it's great.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.400]   But what's hard is sitting across from someone
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.440]   who is 40 or 50, and they haven't been saving 10%.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.760]   No one told them to do that.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.640]   And they're just catching up.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.240]   And for them to get to a 25% savings rate or a 30% savings
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.480]   rate that might be necessary based on that table
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.600]   in order to retire by the time they're 65
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   might require downsizing a house.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.360]   Maybe the child-- you've got kids.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.200]   The kids don't want to leave the house, right?
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.440]   These are very emotional decisions.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.280]   But let me just tell you this.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.920]   I have seen people make that transition.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   And I always say, you can always go back.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.360]   You can always go back to the spending you had previously.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.280]   But what people tell me is that the peace
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.040]   that they feel after making that decision,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.080]   there is no amount of spending that can replace it.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.380]   So if you are in that place and you're inspired to do it,
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.760]   I don't think that you will ever regret it.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.600]   We haven't seen anyone do it.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   I also want to do a shout out to the Pivot podcast.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.320]   Sorry.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.520]   Sorry, Catching Up Defy.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.640]   I'm so sorry.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.960]   Catching Up Defy podcast.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.440]   It is a really terrific one.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.560]   We have seen people make the pivot that Bill and Jackie
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.920]   talk about in tremendous ways.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.000]   And it's very inspiring for people
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.160]   who are wanting to make a big change
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.800]   and be able to get on track for retirement.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   I think your podcast is fabulous.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.960]   I have found that it's really, really hard to get somebody
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.680]   who's always been a spender to change behavior.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.680]   There's some marginal things that can be done,
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.600]   like use cash, make it more obvious when
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.200]   you're spending the money.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.840]   But it can be done, but I think it's very hard to be done.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.520]   And with Bogleheads, quite frankly--
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.920]   and I'm absolutely guilty.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.680]   My relationship with money is not healthy.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.760]   I've been frugal.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.280]   I realize I can't take the money with me when I go,
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.200]   but it's still hard for me to spend.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.960]   And I have that problem with a lot of my clients.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.040]   And I say, here's the advice that I have,
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.880]   but it's coming from a hypocrite.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.520]   Here's a question.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.160]   What conversation should I be having
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.040]   with my financial advisor, who I never hear from?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.840]   I think you start with saying, listen, you hypocrite.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.720]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:03.560]   The best financial advisor is mostly a therapist, I think,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.200]   and understands the psychology and the emotional side.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.160]   Anyone can do the math.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.880]   I mean, AI, I guess, can do the math now.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720]   Maybe, I don't know.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.680]   And so it really is a coach, someone
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.960]   that reminds you about your plan when you
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.560]   forgot that you set that plan, someone that reminds you what
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.240]   the goal is when you've forgotten.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.040]   When emotions are louder than the plan,
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   sometimes the best advisor can just kind of gently point you
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.160]   back to that plan.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.960]   Well, this is a touchy subject, quite frankly.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.440]   So I started out as a broker for 10 years,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.840]   and then I had my own money management company.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   And when I was a broker, I called myself
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   a financial advisor.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.760]   But in fact, I was trying to sell whatever product
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.600]   they were asking me to sell.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.400]   I wasn't really doing advice.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.840]   I was selling something, whatever
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.640]   the brokerage company wanted me to.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.560]   And then I figured that out.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.440]   And then I said, OK, I really want to manage money.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.800]   So when I started managing money,
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.240]   I was a portfolio manager, managing investment portfolios.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.280]   And my goal was to bring in clients and manage their money
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.720]   so that I get paid higher fees.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.840]   I mean, was I a financial advisor at that point?
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.880]   We used to help them with asset allocation,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.420]   and we used to do the fund selection.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.880]   But I really wasn't advising them
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.200]   on how much they should take out or whether they should go ahead
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.440]   and take their Social Security money.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.400]   I wasn't giving them a lot of financial advice.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.120]   I really wasn't an advisor.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.280]   But I called myself a financial advisor.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   Now, when I'm finally doing what Alan Roth is doing,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   I think I can say I'm a financial advisor,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.520]   because the only thing I do is give advice.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.480]   So the first question I would ask,
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.040]   if your financial advisor is not calling you,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.280]   they're probably not a financial advisor.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.400]   They probably sold you some products,
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.160]   or they're probably managing your money
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.280]   and don't want to hear from you, quite frankly.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.700]   Because the best client, if you're
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.640]   managing somebody's money, the best clients
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.000]   are the ones who never call.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.520]   Never call.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320]   You don't have to spend any time with them.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.600]   You get the charge fee every single quarter.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.880]   Those are the best clients.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.120]   We used to say that internally in the firm.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.440]   Oh, those are the best clients.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.520]   They never call.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.280]   All right, so my point is that financial advice
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:19.240]   is a different business than selling products, or insurance,
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.640]   or managing money.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.360]   It really is what Alan's been doing for many years.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.280]   I am not a life advisor.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.640]   I am not a therapist.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.880]   I'm still working on my own life.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.840]   A lot of work to do.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.200]   So I'm only taking clients that really understand and just need
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.360]   a little help in some of the complexities of getting out
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   of some of the tax implications of getting out
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.160]   of complexities.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.240]   And I'm going to brag again.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.280]   I have the worst client retention in the business,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.600]   doing a one-time plan, giving them
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.140]   a roadmap of what to do going forward,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.760]   because I don't know what the market's going to do next week,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.420]   and I don't know what the market's going
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.240]   to look like four years from now.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.040]   So they won't hear from me.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   Other than my free monthly newsletter,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.000]   they're welcome to get.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.240]   And then occasionally, we talk and be friends,
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.920]   but I don't bill them for it.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.240]   Here's the big thing you need to know.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.800]   If you have a financial advisor, chances
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.840]   are you chose this person for a reason, right?
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.880]   They're really friendly, maybe go to church together.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.520]   So there are a lot of people in that situation
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.840]   where they just don't know how to break up with this person,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.580]   because it feels so personal.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.200]   But they're such nice people, right?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.580]   They're all doing it for free, right?
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.740]   Oh, no, they're not, are they?
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.460]   So let's say that you have $1 million with this person,
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.400]   and they have this 1% AUM fee.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.060]   What is a 1% AUM fee?
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.780]   What is that? $10,000.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.100]   Nice friend.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.660]   Then you're like, oh, OK, well, things
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.920]   are a little different now that I know how much I'm paying.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   And so this is where you can get a little bit more objectivity
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.620]   just by doing a little bit of research.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.200]   So what you want to do is pull up an email and say, hey,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.520]   I was just at this conference.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.320]   I'm learning a lot more about my money.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.300]   And I'd like to know, there's this thing--
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.960]   I don't really know what it all means,
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.800]   but maybe you could answer this question.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.400]   What's this AUM fee?
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.760]   Do you have one?
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.480]   And then are there fees on the funds themselves?
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   I'm just trying to understand it all.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.040]   And then you'll be switching financial advisors after that.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.760]   There's a lot of financial advisor training
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.600]   on hooking the client by being their life advisor,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.560]   and that's nothing I believe in.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.640]   So in this session, we've talked primarily
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.040]   about savings and investing.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.800]   But I want to ask you to just--
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.880]   what are some of the other really important messages
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.660]   you would give people here in the context of a 101
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.160]   program on things beyond saving and investing
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.960]   that are really important for their financial well-being?
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.400]   I have one interesting stat.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.200]   And I was reminded of this when SC
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   was talking about someone that's maybe 40 that's fallen behind
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.520]   and wished they would have.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:32.600]   We've helped a couple million people probably go through
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.560]   and really kind of radically change the way
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.760]   they think about their money.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.680]   And what happens is they start to spend their money on things
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.720]   they really care about.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.840]   A lot of times, that looks like paying off debt and investing.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   And so I've asked maybe a couple hundred people
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.020]   this direct question where I say, listen,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.240]   you were living paycheck to paycheck just right
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.440]   at the edge for years.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.800]   And then suddenly, you have this extra money.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   And you paid off thousands of dollars in debt.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   And your net worth just completely transformed
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.120]   in short order.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.600]   What was your secret?
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.720]   Did you get a big raise?
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.840]   Did you change jobs?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.200]   Did you downsize and do a big financial big shift like that?
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.140]   And of those couple hundred people that I've asked,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.940]   this isn't scientific, but it is true.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.360]   I have gotten the same answer every single time.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.380]   And these are success stories that I'm talking to.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.140]   But they'll say, well, we cut back on our spending.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.700]   And that just means they spend differently.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.460]   And I say, well, where did you cut back?
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.820]   And I'm not kidding you.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:49.340]   100% of respondents say they eat out less.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.700]   And so for all the talk about, gosh, how do I do this?
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.900]   How do I do this?
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.100]   I'm just telling you a response from a couple hundred people
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.300]   that suddenly found thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.980]   of extra dollars over some meaningful period of time
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.100]   and that turned them around.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.220]   I don't know why that is, but it is.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.300]   And so you can just take that one little nugget
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.460]   and not go out to eat tonight, I guess.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.060]   I don't know what you'll do with it.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.700]   You're on your own tonight, if I heard correctly.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.100]   So yeah.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.060]   Couple of things.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.540]   Maybe I'm jumping in front here.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.100]   But have a will, have powers of attorney,
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.660]   financial powers of attorney, health care power of attorney.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.460]   Do some real basic estate planning.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.100]   So many people don't.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.140]   And I see a lot of people who have trust accounts
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.260]   and they're not funded, there's nothing in it.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.100]   You say, well, the will is going to do that.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.020]   Well, guess what?
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.980]   If the will does that, it means it
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.740]   goes through probate, which defeats
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.860]   the purpose of having the trust account to begin with.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.340]   And the second thing is-- and again, if I'm jumping ahead--
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.020]   insurance.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.220]   Insure your most valuable asset, which
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.180]   is your ability to earn money.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.820]   So have the correct life insurance, term life insurance,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.300]   low cost insurance, and disability insurance.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.340]   Super great there.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.020]   The other thing I would add that we didn't discuss is our time.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:21.940]   And when I was younger, money was more important than time.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.860]   But as I've got three children, and we've
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.020]   gotten closer to financial independence as a couple,
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.300]   my husband and I have realized that there is nothing
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.500]   more precious than our time.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.140]   And we have learned how to part with money,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.820]   because you have to learn how to spend
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.780]   when you have been a significant saver,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.820]   to buy back hours of our time.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:50.940]   So we discuss that a lot, what the value of our time
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.900]   as a family is together and how much
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.780]   we're willing to pay for that.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.300]   So for instance, I have recently purchased a lot of my time
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.580]   back in my business by hiring people.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.940]   So I don't have to work as much, and I can meet
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.540]   my daughter at the bus stop.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.420]   That's really important to me.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.140]   So you can also think about things a lot more differently
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.540]   when you start approaching financial independence.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.300]   It's a big reason to get there, because you're essentially not
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.140]   retiring.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.020]   You're buying your hours, which I think is priceless, right?
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:31.260]   And I would say, have a healthy relationship with money.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.700]   Determine what makes you happy.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.620]   I remember as a kid, if I went to the movies with my friends,
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.700]   it would be over within two hours.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.380]   If I bought stuff, I could have it forever.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.060]   I had it completely backwards.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.380]   Similar, not exactly what you do,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.820]   I see, but I define wealth in terms of years.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.220]   Who's wealthier?
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:58.900]   Someone with $500,000 and needs $20,000 above Social Security
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.020]   to live on?
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.540]   They have 25 years worth of financial freedom.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.180]   Or somebody that has $20 million,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.860]   but they need $10 million a year to live on.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.180]   They have two years worth of financial freedom.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.220]   They're poor.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.020]   And who do you think is probably happier?
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:20.420]   Jesse, do you have any other thoughts for us
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.460]   on how to spend thoughtfully?
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.740]   Make those decisions of how to spend our money.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.580]   I mentioned already that the tense is,
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.900]   you just have to make sure that you have it in context.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.900]   So a pile of money in a bank account
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.220]   only tells you how much money is in the bank account.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.260]   It actually lies, really.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.420]   It's a lie.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.780]   And people will sometimes use that pile of money to say,
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.060]   I think I can afford this.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.180]   I think I can afford that.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:47.900]   And they're wrong.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.980]   That question of, can I afford something,
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.940]   or should I spend money on this, is
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.180]   a pretty stressful question.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.940]   If you're living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.900]   or if you're just in the habit of not spending,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.660]   it also can stress you out.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.220]   And so the only part that's really important
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.480]   is to make sure that you see that pile of money with purpose,
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.820]   and that purpose is yours.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.980]   But as you see it broken down with purpose,
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.740]   the answers do start to show themselves.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.380]   It's not rocket science.
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.420]   It's not brain surgery.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.660]   It's just you with the right context.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.860]   And recognizing that money is, by definition, finite,
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.460]   and that finiteness, that scarcity,
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.220]   actually instructs you--
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.620]   we often tell people that scarcity is clarity.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.860]   Meaning, the fact that you don't have an unlimited amount
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.540]   presses you to trade off and decide
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.580]   what's most important to you.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.140]   Thank you.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.260]   I think that's a great note to end on.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.140]   I want to thank our panel for giving us
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.860]   a lot of really great specific pointers,
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.100]   but also, almost more importantly,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.560]   giving us a framework to think about a lot of these questions
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.940]   around money.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.700]   Thank you all.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.060]   [APPLAUSE]
