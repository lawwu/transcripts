[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Richard from Manhasset, New York writes in to ask this.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   "Pastor John, since Christian hedonists believe humans are joy seekers
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and will always make decisions based upon what brings them the most pleasure,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   how did Adam and Eve sin when they experienced perfect, unbroken communion with God,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   the greatest pleasure?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Doesn't the first human sin in fact reveal that perfect delight in God
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   is not strong enough to overpower the allurement of temptations?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I would say no, I don't think that's what it reveals.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   What the first human sin reveals is that God did not preserve in the hearts of Adam and Eve
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   perfect delight in Him.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   He let them be lured away from that perfect delight in Himself,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and that is precisely why they found the tree more compelling than God.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   In the moment that they chose the forbidden fruit,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   they were not delighting in God more than in the fruit.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   They had been tricked.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That's the point of Genesis 3, 1 to 6.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Let's just read it and watch how Moses, the writer,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   is helping us understand why it is that they cave.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   So here's what he says.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "The serpent is more crafty," that's a key word,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   "than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He said to the woman, 'Did God actually say?'"
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So he is trying to get her to stop being satisfied in the trustworthiness of God.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?'
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And the woman said to the serpent, 'We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   but God said, 'You shall not eat of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,'"
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and we have no record that he said it was in the middle.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   "Neither shall you touch it."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   We have no record that he said you should not touch it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So what we get here is a little clue that Eve is starting to feel like
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   maybe God is holding out on her.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   The tree's in the middle, and we can't even touch it,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   which he had not evidently said.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   At least there's no record of it.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   "But the serpent said to the woman, 'You will not surely die.'"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Blatant assault on God's trustworthiness and character.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But God knows when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   In other words, he's holding out on you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Stop finding your full delight in God, because he's holding out on you.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He's not really giving you what's best for you.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   "So"--very important words here--"so when the woman saw that the tree was good for food
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and that it was a delight to the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to make one wise,"
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   in other words, when she was persuaded in the moment that God was not all-satisfying,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   she took of the fruit and ate and gave some to her husband, and he ate.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So I don't think there's anything there that contradicts Christian hedonism.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   If we find our fullest pleasure in God, we will in that moment not choose what is sinful.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But if that satisfaction in God wavers, then we become vulnerable, and that's where sin comes from.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Sin is the preference of anything that God has forbidden.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We will never prefer that.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We will never prefer what God has forbidden, as long as God himself is our supreme satisfaction.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   One of the differences--this is something that they didn't ask, but I think is so crucial--
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   one of the differences between Adam and Eve, on the one hand, and the children of God in Christ today,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   on the other hand, is that God has committed himself in the new covenant never to let his children fall away utterly.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   They can backslide, but he convicts them and brings them back.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Jeremiah 32, 40, "I will make with them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from doing good to them,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and I will put the fear of me in their hearts that they may not turn from me."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Ooh, I love that promise.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   God commits himself to holding on to us.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   We just sang last Sunday. I love that song. "He Will Hold Me Fast." Beautiful song.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   This is a great improvement over the arrangements in the Garden of Eden,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and we owe it to the blood of Christ, the blood of the new covenant.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   That is a beautiful song and a beautiful promise. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And thank you, Richard, for the question.

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "If everything is about finding joy in God, what do I do when God feels distant from me?"
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I'll ask Pastor John tomorrow.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the podcast.
