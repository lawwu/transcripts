[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   I want to talk to you tonight about something that I think is really critical.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.960]   We've gotten up to it, but we haven't gone through it.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.640]   I started out on Wednesday from 2 Corinthians 6:14, "Do not be unequally yoked together
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.420]   with unbelievers."
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.420]   And I tried to lay down the reality that that is an inviolable divine law, that we don't
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.280]   engage in any enterprise or any effort that intends to advance the kingdom of God in connection
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.780]   with unbelievers.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.580]   And I think that was really clear.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.100]   The popular trend is against that.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.320]   Popular trend is to make as many alliances with unbelieving institutions or unbelieving
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.400]   allies as you can.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.340]   As you possibly can under the delusion that somehow you advance the kingdom of God with
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.160]   such alliances.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.260]   I want to see if I can't address that, and especially you're going to find that what
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.860]   I say tonight is going to connect with a lot of things you heard today, and even specifically
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.000]   with some of the things that Steve said in the last session.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.700]   But I'll leave that connection for you to make, and I don't need to make it myself.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.980]   The book of worship is the Psalms.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.380]   So I want you to open up your eyes.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.920]   I want you to open your Bible to the Psalms.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   This is the book of worship, 150 Psalms.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.600]   I just want you to look at the opening Psalm.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.780]   Psalm 1 is the gate to worship.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.460]   Psalm 1 is the gatekeeper.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.560]   It isn't the first Psalm that was written, but under the superintendence of the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.360]   I believe the Psalms were put in this order because Psalm 1 is the gatekeeper.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:08.440]   And what Psalm 1 says establishes, establishes the divine expectation for worshipers.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.080]   As you enter in the gate of the Psalms, this is what you hear: "How blessed is the man
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.340]   in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.880]   And in his law he meditates day and night.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.900]   He will be like a tree planted firmly by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season,
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.580]   and its leaf doesn't wither; and in whatever he does he prospers."
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.580]   That's one kind of worshiper coming through the gate.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.140]   Here's another kind: "The wicked are not so, but they're like chaff which the wind
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.320]   drives away; therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.820]   assembly of the righteous.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.540]   For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish."
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.200]   God is saying to the worshipers as they enter the temple, "I know who you are.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.120]   You can't fool Me.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   I know you.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.300]   You don't belong in the assembly of the righteous, because you're going to perish."
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.560]   You're among the perishing.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.020]   This is the gate to worship.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.980]   God expects worshipers to be true worshipers.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.860]   God is not honored in the false and hypocritical worship of the wicked.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.280]   That's from the get-go in the Psalms.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.740]   In order to amalgamate the righteous and the wicked in an act of worship is a foundational
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.420]   violation of God's expectation for what worship is.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.500]   This psalm is there at the gate to stop the wicked from entering worship.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:25.260]   "And the Lord knows the righteous, and He knows the wicked, and the wicked will perish."
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.300]   This was a stunning reality for the Jews as they came to worship.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.760]   Do an inventory.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.480]   Do you belong here?
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:50.700]   Psalm 2, really another sort of gatekeeper psalm, points in verse 11 of Psalm 2.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   We'll just look at that.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.240]   "Worship the Lord with reverence, and rejoice with trembling."
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.420]   So you come in with reverence.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.680]   You come in with trembling.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.240]   And you do homage to the Son.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.320]   Isn't that amazing that it's all the way back at the beginning of the Psalter?
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.800]   And you do homage to the Son.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.080]   Literally you bow to the Son.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.000]   Literally you kiss the Son.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.360]   Literally you prostrate yourself on the ground and kiss His feet in submission to Him, or
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.220]   He will be what?
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.620]   Angry.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.160]   And you may die on the spot, for His wrath may soon be kindled.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.860]   How blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.520]   So Psalm 1 and 2, welcome to worship.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.980]   This is not come one, come all.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.380]   This is how you are to worship.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.200]   This is how you are to approach worship.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   And by the way, the Lord knows who are His.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.960]   The Lord knows who are His, of course.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.180]   Second Timothy 2:19, "The Lord knows those who are His."
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.640]   The Lord knows those who are His.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:21.180]   John 10, several times, "I know My sheep, I know My sheep."
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.180]   And because the Lord knows who are His, He knows.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.680]   He will make a distinction.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.180]   Listen to that distinction in the words of Peter in Peter 2.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.340]   "God did not spare the ancient world but preserved Noah, preacher of righteousness, with seven
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.860]   others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.300]   And if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.680]   ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter, and
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.660]   if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men, for
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.260]   by what he saw and heard, that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.620]   soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds, then" - and this is the point - "the
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.080]   Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation or trial, and to keep the unrighteous under
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.920]   punishment for the day of judgment."
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.000]   God sorts everybody out.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.200]   God knows who the true worshipers are.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:43.620]   Maybe there was a recollection of Psalm 1 in the mind of our Lord in the Sermon on the
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620]   Mount.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.320]   Turn to Matthew 7.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:08:01.780]   In verse 13, "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.020]   that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.720]   For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.520]   find it."
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.120]   Just a brief comment: there are more people on the religious road to hell than on the
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.320]   right road to heaven.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   There are the many and the few.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:31.600]   Down in verse 21, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   heaven; but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.180]   Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.140]   name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.280]   Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice law.'"
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   .
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation or trial.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from the way of judgment.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from temptation.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from the way of judgment.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from the way of judgment.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from the way of judgment.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   He knows how to rescue the wicked from the way of judgment.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:04.160]   God doesn't want the lawless in His temple; He doesn't want them in His heaven.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   They don't belong in worship.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.260]   I wonder in this particular form of evangelical today.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:26.140]   If we aren't producing some broad-gate Baptist churches, the first broad-gate Baptist church
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:41.120]   of whoever, wherever, maybe even some broad-gate Bible churches.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.700]   We've been talking about the gospel.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.260]   We all understand that.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   . .
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.000]   We heard a classic message from Steve on preaching the Word.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.440]   And in that message, he came down to verse 5, and I'm going to pick up the baton at verse
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.200]   5, on "Do the work of an evangelist."
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.480]   Do the work of an evangelist.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.260]   I think that means evangelize your church.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.260]   . . .
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.260]   . . .
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.260]   . . .
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:23.200]   the Psalm 1, you know God was saying that the crowd that came in to worship Him in the
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.040]   temple, side by side stood the righteous and the wicked.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.840]   And it was the same in Judaism at the time of our Lord.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.340]   There were those on the way to perdition and those on the way to glory.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.540]   They were all there gathered in the temple.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.520]   And you'll notice, as Steve commented on 2 Timothy 4, "Do the work of an evangelist is
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:01.900]   the only way that you can complete your ministry."
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.880]   How many pastors are trying to make their congregation feel good when they ought to
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.680]   be feeling terrified?
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.320]   I don't know.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.520]   I don't know.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   That term, "fulfill your ministry," in 2 Timothy 4:5 is a compound verb that means to fully
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.280]   accomplish.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.640]   Romans 4:21 uses it, and it says, "Abraham was fully assured that what God had promised
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.360]   he was able to perform."
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.300]   Colossians 4:12 uses the same verb to mean "fully assured."
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.540]   "Fully assured," that is, "to fulfill all the will of God."
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:50.960]   And Paul even uses it again in 2 Timothy 4:17 where he says, and this is the summation of
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.000]   his whole ministry, "The Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that through me the proclamation
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.020]   might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear."
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.500]   It's a compound word that means "to fully accomplish your ministry," and you have not fully accomplished.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.180]   "To fully accomplish your ministry," if you have not at the beginning, at the door said,
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:25.060]   "The righteous and the wicked do not belong together here worshiping."
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:35.560]   This is not, of course, to keep them out, but to bring them in through the gospel.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.480]   I think every time we come to the Lord's table, we need to remember a second time, "I am the
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   righteous and the wicked."
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.500]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 13:5, "Examine yourselves whether you're in the faith."
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.740]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11, "I want to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.360]   and I'm afraid you're going to be led astray.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.040]   You're going to be deceived like Eve was deceived."
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.820]   This is part of the reason that I think he says, "Be sober," and you pointed that out
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.420]   so strongly.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.460]   Part of the soberness of pastoral ministry.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.020]   You just don't take people at face value.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.940]   That's short-sighted.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:22.560]   That's superficial.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:30.540]   We have to, in shepherding the sheep, we have to know the condition of the flock, and they
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.860]   have to know their true condition.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.440]   It was February 9, 1969.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:45.620]   Some of you hadn't even been born, obviously.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.560]   I came to Grace Community Church on the first Sunday over in the chapel on a rainy day.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.400]   I stood up and preached my first sermon at this church to a chapel full of happy, expectant
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:04.620]   people, and I preached on Matthew 7:13 to 23.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.420]   And I came out with blazing eyes.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.680]   I said, "I've been through a lot.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.040]   I've been through a lot.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.060]   I've been through a lot."
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.060]   I said, "I've been through a lot.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   I've been through a lot."
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.060]   And I said, "I've been through a lot."
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:12.380]   So how do we help our people to know whether they're genuinely converted?
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:18.080]   We can preach the word Adam and preach the word Adam, but by what criteria do we evaluate
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.640]   their spiritual condition and help them to see it?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:30.040]   That's a vital part of pastoral ministry.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:40.160]   Last Sunday I preached on Ephesians, chapter 4, and I honestly can't let go of it, so go
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.360]   back there, Ephesians, chapter 4.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:57.640]   This is a good starting point, I think, to help you understand that God puts severe restrictions
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.020]   on who comes to worship Him.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:07.780]   And if what you're doing is worshiping Him, those restrictions apply.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:13.360]   If you're just holding a rock concert, then that's different.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.240]   God puts severe restrictions on worship, and it's for the righteous and it's not for the
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:30.000]   wicked, and many of them don't know what category they're in, and that's why they show up
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.760]   in Matthew 7 saying, "Lord, Lord," and they find out they had no relationship with Him.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:49.280]   So here is a distinguishing portion of Scripture that will help you and your people do a spiritual
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   inventory.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.980]   Ephesians 4:17, "So this I say," or "therefore," "I affirm that I will not be a sinner, but
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.980]   I will walk with the Lord."
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.980]   "I affirm," together with the Lord.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.040]   I love that.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.380]   That's what preachers do, right?
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:15.220]   We affirm with the Lord that you walk no longer just as the ethne walk.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.560]   You don't walk that way anymore.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.840]   In the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.960]   life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   heart.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   .
