[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.440]   All right, well, I thought we'd get started today with something I haven't done in recent weeks, but I miss which is a deep dive.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.960]   The deep dive I want to do today is on the question, why are we burnt out?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.600]   Now this deep dive is drawing from a New Yorker article that I published a couple weeks ago,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.400]   it was a New Yorker article where I was introducing to the New Yorker audience
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.280]   this idea of slow productivity that we have talked about here on this show,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.080]   but I was also using this article as an excuse to help refine my thinking on that topic.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:49.320]   Now I opened that article talking about a bill that has been proposed in the US Congress.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   It was originally written by a California representative, Mark Takano,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.840]   and has since been endorsed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, that's a hundred different congressmen and women.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.640]   And this was a bill that was arguing that the federal work week,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.880]   so the federally recognized work week, should go down from 40 hours to 32.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.960]   I opened my article talking about this bill.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.720]   Now, reducing the federally recognized work week down to roughly four days
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.520]   would most directly impact people who are hourly workers,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.440]   because technically what that means is that if you work beyond the federal work week number of hours,
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.800]   you have to get paid overtime.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.200]   So salaried workers, and most knowledge worker types are salaried,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.320]   wouldn't be directly impacted by this law.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.880]   But as Representative Takano made clear,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.120]   he also had overworked computer screen and email types in his mind when he put together this bill.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   If you change the federally recognized work week,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.920]   there would be a pressure even on salaried positions
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.480]   to think about reducing the length of the work week.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.840]   There would be other things that would happen,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.040]   such as many government knowledge worker style jobs would go to that work week.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.120]   There would be a lot of pressures.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.800]   And he acknowledged this in quotes he had about the bill,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.920]   that he was keeping these computer screen and email style workers in mind when he proposed this bill.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.880]   He actually responded to my New Yorker article and emphasized that point.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.320]   Yes, he had knowledge workers in mind,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920]   among other constituencies, of course, when writing that bill.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   All right, so why are we considering potentially a four-day work week?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   Well, the issue is burnout.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.480]   If you dive into the data on what they're calling the great resignation,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   something which I've written about before,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.920]   but if you dive into the data, what you see is,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.120]   yes, there's a lot of people who are quitting their jobs,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.640]   but not really among the ranks of knowledge workers,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   the heavy turnover seems to be happening more in service and hospitality type sectors.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.760]   What we are seeing, the data is clear about this,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.480]   in the knowledge work sector, the sector of people who use Zoom all day,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.760]   what you are seeing there is maybe not a huge rash of quitting, but burnout on the rise.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   There's many different ways you can measure this that all seem to be coming together to the same point,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.320]   which is knowledge workers are burning out.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.040]   And this burnout got much worse during the pandemic.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.120]   So this four-day work week was being proposed in part
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.880]   in response to the burnout that you're seeing among knowledge workers.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.600]   So I opened my article on that point, but then I gave the kicker,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.080]   which is, I don't think it's going to help them.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   I think there are clearly other sectors of the economy
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.480]   where reducing the recognized work week would be useful,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.920]   could create good, but it's not going to solve what is burning out knowledge workers.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.640]   All right, so well, this brings us to the question of what is burning out knowledge workers?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   If it's not, they have to work too long.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   What is it that is burning out knowledge workers?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.280]   And here my argument was that you need to look past
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.160]   how many hours are you expected to work and instead look at what I call work volume.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.680]   If you take an individual worker, what is the total number of commitments
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.360]   that is currently on their plate, be them big or small, major projects,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.200]   just need to get back with someone with some information and everything in between.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.400]   What is the total amount of commitments on their plate?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.840]   This is the work volume.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.280]   My argument is that when work volume gets too large, burnout follows.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.680]   There's two reasons for this.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.280]   The first reason is neurological.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.440]   We actually have in our brain, and by we, I mean our species,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   because this is unique to Homo sapiens as far as we're concerned.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.680]   We've studied similar primate cousins like macaque monkeys
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.520]   and cannot find the same brain region.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.960]   We have a region in our brain that finds what makes humans humans that specializes
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.080]   in looking at what we need to get done and making a long-term plan.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   You know, it's getting cold.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.400]   We need our cave to be ready for the winter,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.520]   whatever that means in 100,000 years ago.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.240]   Let's make a plan.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.520]   Let's execute the plan.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.600]   We're motivated to actually pursue the plan.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.920]   We feel good when the plan is executed.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.840]   This is fundamental to human nature.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.680]   It is why, in some sense, this fundamental neurological productivity,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.760]   why we were able to leverage our brains to really separate from other species, right?
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.800]   So we're wired to figure out how to do things, how to get things done and to execute it.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.280]   When you have excessive work volume, what happens is you have more on your plate
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.680]   than this region of your brain can reasonably actually consider and plan how to get it done.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.120]   You short-circuit those planning circuits.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.240]   And when you short-circuit that, it feels really bad.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   You feel anxious.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.080]   You feel unnerved.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.480]   It's just like how we crave sugar.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.080]   The metabolic processes of our body crave sugar because we have a evolutionary reason to do so.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.640]   But when we eat seven Snickers bars, it completely overloads our body and bad things happen.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.280]   So the same thing.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.880]   We crave, "Give me something to do.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.560]   Let me make a plan and execute and feel good."
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.520]   But if we put 75 things on our to-do list,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.720]   we can't even conceive of how we're going to get all of those things done.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.240]   We feel bad.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.840]   All right, so there's a neurological source of burnout here.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.320]   My editor at The New Yorker wisely cut that out.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.920]   I did actually get into some of the actual brain stuff going on in the article,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.440]   but it got in the way of the narrative.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.000]   We cut it out.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.680]   But there is, let's just rest assured, good neurological backing to this point.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   The second issue with excessive work volume, and maybe even the worst issue,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.320]   is what I dub the overhead spiral.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.480]   So here's the thing.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.560]   Most non-trivial commitments that you make in a knowledge work setting
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   bring with it a fixed amount of overhead.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.280]   A fixed amount of overhead that involves you needing to collaborate with other people to get
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.480]   that work done.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   So if there's some project that you're supposed to be doing,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.040]   there's some number of meetings you probably have to have with people who are involved.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.880]   There's some number of phone calls or emails that have to be sent to gather all the information
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.360]   you will need to get that project done.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   This, of course, is very reasonable.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.640]   Hey, I work in an organization.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.440]   I'm trying to do this.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.640]   I'm going to need help from other people.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.240]   I'm going to need information from other people.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   So I will have to send some emails.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.200]   I'll have to have some meetings.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.160]   Completely reasonable.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.440]   The issue is everything you are committed to do, however, brings with it its own,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.680]   in isolation, reasonable amount of this overhead.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.600]   So if you increase the number of things that are on your plate,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.240]   you are responsible for the amount of this overhead begins to grow until it takes over
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.120]   most of your schedule until most of your work.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.400]   Most of your work time is actually being dedicated to a the meetings that have to happen to
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   touch base on every one of these projects and the back and forth emails and phone calls needed
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.840]   to keep each of these projects moving.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.240]   And soon you find yourself doing almost nothing but this overhead work and very little actually
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.800]   gets done.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   We saw this very clearly early in the pandemic where what happened is when we shifted and by
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.880]   we I'm talking again, knowledge workers right now people who work in offices.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:18.320]   And the pandemic began, it created a sudden increase in work volumes because a lot of
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.840]   things had to be figured out and changed when companies went remote.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.640]   How do we do this now?
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.360]   How do we do that now?
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.040]   Right? So there's a sudden increase in work volume.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.680]   The, the metric here is the number of average number of commitments on each worker's plate
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.360]   really went up.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.240]   So this raised the overhead, the number of meetings that had to happen in the number
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.360]   of emails that had to happen.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.160]   What was the result?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.840]   Quite a few office workers reported to me that they ended up having eight hours zoom days.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.160]   Back to back to back to back to back to back meetings to talk about work.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.480]   Why?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.800]   Because each of these things they now have to do requires a meeting each week and they
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   have enough of these things that those meetings all have to happen.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.080]   And soon all they're doing is meetings and no work actually gets done.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   Well, this is incredibly frustrating and it also leads to burnout.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.000]   So these two things, the short circuiting of our planning circuit and the overhead spiral,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   these two things that come along with increased work volume generates burnout.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.160]   That's my argument.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.680]   All right.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.200]   So now if we look back at this proposition, well, what we need is a four day work week.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.600]   That's not going to solve burnout because all of those issues of increased work volume
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.240]   are still there.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.760]   If anything, they're going to get worse.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.160]   If you take a day off of the week where none of this overhead can happen, then the other
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.680]   days are going to get even more crowded.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.280]   And the stress you have from having more things on your plate than your brain can plan, nothing
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.920]   about that stress changes if you're not working on Mondays.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.760]   You still have all those things.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.600]   You still can't plan how it's going to get done.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.120]   So my argument is the issue is not the number of hours we're expected to work.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.640]   That is an industrial mindset.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.520]   If we're looking at industrial work in which the worker has very little autonomy,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.040]   where after the Taylorism revolution in the early 20th century, you have a small number
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.800]   of people who figure out the best way to execute the work, the best way to build the cars.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.840]   They break it down in the steps, they optimize, and then the workers are just told, here's
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.560]   what you should do.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.480]   Sit here on this assembly line, do that bolt, turn that wrench.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.280]   In that type of work, where the worker is just doing the same task repetitively, the
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.680]   only knob you have to turn is the number of hours you work.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.040]   And so if you are exhausted or burnt out from work, you need to do less work.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   Reduce the hours, pay more for the time.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.000]   It makes complete sense.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.920]   This does not translate to knowledge work.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.920]   We are not stressed because nine to five is too many hours to be working.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.760]   From a physical toil perspective, knowledge work is easy.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.720]   You're in an air conditioned box on a $700 chair.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.040]   Looking at a computer screen and doing social media on the side.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.520]   It is not a toil on our body.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.280]   Our problem is not I need to get away from that.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   It is the psychological and logistical weight of overload that comes from these work volumes
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.560]   getting too large.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.600]   So the answer is reduce the work volumes.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.200]   Not reduce the amount of work a company does.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.000]   I'm not saying that you say, okay, we're going to drastically slash the number of clients
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.560]   we service.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.000]   We're going to drastically decrease the rate at which our software is produced.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   No, don't get me wrong about that.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.120]   What I'm saying is the amount of work that's on individuals' plates should be reduced down
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.200]   to the point at any one moment that they do not feel their short circuiting of their planning
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.600]   circuits and the overhead of what is currently on their plate is manageable.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   That means all of the other work that does still have to get done has to be stored somewhere.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.840]   Else it is an idea I come back to again and again.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.280]   It's an idea that is at the core of my most recent book, A World Without Email.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.520]   Companies and organizations themselves have to do more work towards organizing work.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.000]   All these different things that may or may not have to get done from the very small to
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   the very big, don't put them on this person's plate.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.120]   Have them in a system.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   And when that person's done with what they're working on, you give them a new thing.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.560]   They only have one or two things on their plate at a time.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.240]   You have a lot of admin forum, have admin blocks, you can come to them and sign up and
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   take a slot and work with them to fill out forms.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.920]   You can't just throw things on their plate.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.560]   We cannot underestimate the toil and hardship that comes from just saying,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.520]   let's distribute all work to individuals and let them figure it out.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.920]   Reduce work volume, not the rate at which work is accomplished.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.360]   If anything, people are going to produce more work at higher quality because there's no
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.680]   overhead spiral and they're not stressed out.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.320]   But let them do what they do well and then give them the next thing.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.440]   This is harder for managers.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.960]   This is harder for organizations.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.260]   Boo-hoo.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.160]   Everything about work is hard.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.680]   All right, we got to figure it out because what we're doing now is not working.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.840]   All right, so that's my argument.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.600]   So I called this approach, reducing the volume of work on people's plates, I called that
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.640]   in the New Yorker piece, slow productivity.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.840]   And I contrasted this to strategies that are about more cruder approaches, like let's just
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.600]   reduce the number of hours you work.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.760]   Let's give you more vacation days, et cetera.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.560]   That, by contrast, already has a name.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.240]   That's called slow work.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.880]   Slow work is an industrial solution.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.440]   When it comes to computer-aided knowledge work, those industrial solutions won't work.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.400]   Slow work won't work.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.520]   We need slow productivity.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.560]   We have to actually open up the black box of workplaces, look inside that black box and
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   say, OK, what is actually happening?
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.160]   What are you actually doing?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.760]   Oh, it's overhead spirals.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.200]   It's overloading to-do lists.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.720]   Let's change how work is assigned.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.520]   Let's change how much is on your plate.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.200]   That is the revolution we think we need.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.760]   Now, let me just add two quick points before I wrap up this deep dive.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.160]   Reducing work volumes is not the totality of slow work.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.960]   In my New Yorker piece, to keep things simple, I said, that's what I mean.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.120]   Well, between me and you, we're podcast friends.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.880]   So we can talk honestly.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.160]   There's more to slow productivity than just that.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.640]   I see the reducing of work volume as the foundation, foundational part of slow productivity.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:18.880]   But I also see individuals slowing down in the moment, not trying to fill every minute
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.640]   of their day with work, slowing out the timelines on which big projects are executed, but compensating,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:33.920]   compensating for the slowing down with an eye for detail, for craft, for producing work
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.360]   at a really high level of value.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.320]   I think these should also be part of the slow productivity mindset.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   A small number of things at a time so you're not overloaded, at a natural pace, but steady,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.600]   really high attention to craft.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:54.000]   That I think is the sustainable model for doing work with your brain.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   And that is slow productivity.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.960]   So that's why we're burnt out.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.200]   And that is at a very high level what I think we should do about it.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:08.560]   [MUSIC]
