[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   A new week begins on this fine Monday morning. Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And the week begins with a humbling question about shipwrecking the faith.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   What does it look like to make shipwreck of the faith?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   What are some personal examples of faith failing? Why does it happen?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   How do people shipwreck their faith?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   It's a sobering topic and a common question in the inbox represented well by this question
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   from a listener named Andrew. Hello Pastor John, thank you for the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The Apostle Paul talks about some who have made
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   shipwreck of their faith in 1 Timothy 1.19.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   In the next verse Paul singles out Hymenaeus and Alexander,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   both of whom appear to have been professing Christians at some point earlier.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   According to 1 Timothy 1.20, what did they do
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and how do people shipwreck their faith today?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Jesus and Paul and Peter
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and the writer to the Hebrews, all of them,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   describe people who make a seemingly
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   good start in the Christian life and then
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   reject what they once claimed
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   to believe. Sometimes this first
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   condition, first state, is called
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   faith and then is shown to be unreal
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   faith. Faith without works is dead. You could call it
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   dead faith, James would say. Sometimes it's called
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   knowing the way of righteousness and then
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   forsaking it. But in the end, the New Testament
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   teaches that it is possible to make a
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   start in the Christian life, perhaps a very
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   long start, and then throw it away
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and be lost. Not that God ever loses any of
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   His children or any of His elect. He keeps them
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   according to 1 Corinthians 1.9, 1 Thessalonians 5.24,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Philippians 1.6, Romans 8.30.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   In fact, here's what Romans 8.30 says, "Those whom He predestined
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He also called, and those whom He called He also justified,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and those whom He justified He also glorified."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   None of those that God predestines and calls
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   and justifies will ever be lost.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Those He calls, He keeps. That's what those verses
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   teach. But Jesus said in the parable of the soils
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   that the third soil
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   represents those who make a beginning in the
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   discipleship, and then they fall away.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "As for what fell among thorns," He says,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   "they are those who hear, but
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   does not mature." That's Luke 8.14.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Notice what their downfall
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   was. They seem to make a good beginning, but
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   the cares and riches and pleasures of life
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   are their downfall. I want to take note of that because I'm going to come back
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   to that when I finish looking at all these five instances.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What about Paul? So that's Jesus. What about Paul? According to
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Philemon 1.24, Demas
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   was Paul's fellow worker, along with Luke.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So Demas must have looked enough like a true
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Christian to actually pass muster for Paul.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   His standards are really high. Remember John Mark?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He wouldn't even let John Mark go with him the second time, but he's got
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Demas as his partner. And later,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   in 2 Timothy 4.10, Paul writes, "Demas,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   in love with this present age, has
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Notice again the reason for the
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   failure, the shipwreck. Love for this
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   age, this world. Third,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   the text that Andrew, in asking this question, is talking about is 1 Timothy
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   1.19. So here's 18 to 20.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Wage the good warfare, Timothy. Holding faith
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   in a good conscience. By rejecting
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   this, and that "this" refers most immediately to
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   the good conscience. By rejecting this, some have
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Hymenaeus and Alexander. Notice again, what's
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   the root cause of the shipwreck? Rejecting
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   a good conscience. Number four, what about Peter?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   What does Peter say? Here's 2 Peter 2.20.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   "If after they have escaped the
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   entangled in them and overcome,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   the last state has become worse for them than the
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   first." What's the problem? Why did they make shipwreck?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Entangled again in the defilement
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   of the world. And finally, number five,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   given these five illustrations, from the book of Hebrews,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   here's Hebrews 3.12-14. "Take care,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   unbelieving heart leading you to
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   the devil." Now he's talking to brothers. Did you get that?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Evil, unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   of sin, for we have come to share in Christ
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   if we hold fast our original confidence
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   firm to the end." What's the danger? Deceitfulness
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   of sin. So, I think
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   what Paul means by making shipwreck of faith
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   is this kind of defection
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   from professing faith. A person makes
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   a beginning in the Christian life. Perhaps he himself and
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   those around him think it's a real beginning.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And then he abandons the whole thing.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The ship of faith shatters
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   on the rocks. And
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   what's really striking in all five of these
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   descriptions of shipwreck is
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   that the rocks on which the faith shatters
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   are not intellectual problems with
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Christianity. They're not problems with reason. They're not
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   problems with historicity. In every single
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   case, it's a problem with the heart's preference
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   for sin. Number one, shipwreck
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   of the third soil in Jesus' parable is owing to
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   riches and pleasures of life. Two, the shipwreck
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   of Demas is owing to a love for this present age.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Three, the shipwreck of Hymenaeus and Alexander
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   is owing to rejecting a good conscience. Four,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   the shipwreck of those who escape defilements in 2 Peter
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   is that they become entangled with the defilements of the world.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Five, the warning against shipwreck in Hebrews 3
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   is a warning against the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   From this, I conclude that even though there
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   may be real intellectual struggles,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   say, with the historical truthfulness of the Bible or
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   with the justice of the ways of God, nevertheless,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   most shipwreck of faith
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   is not at root intellectual, but
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   rather because I want what I
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   want, and Christianity is in the
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   way. So let's pray
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   for those who have turned away,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   not only that they would see the way of truth
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   as true, but that they would delight
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   in the way of holiness.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yes, may they delight in the way of holiness. Thank you, Pastor John. And there's
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   another angle to this discussion, because those who make a shipwreck of their
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   faith, those who love the world and abandon Christ for it,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   those people introduce tremendous pain into families,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   into friendships, into local church communities, and
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   pain into the lives of the ministries of those people that they leave
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   behind. We get a sense of how deep these wounds go from the
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   life and ministry of the Apostle Paul. Next time, we're going to look at his
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   testimony and the relational pain he faced in the ministry
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as a result of those making shipwreck of the faith.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   That's next time. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   on Wednesday.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   [end]
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   [end]
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   [end]
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
