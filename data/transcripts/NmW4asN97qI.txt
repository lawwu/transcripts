[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.100]   Marco from Reading, Pennsylvania writes in to ask this question, "Pastor John, what
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.440]   do you make of the saying, 'God loves the sinner but hates the sin'?" The problem
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.480]   with the statement, "God loves the sinner but hates the sin," is that it's misleading.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.240]   It's not a false statement. And what's misleading about it is the word "but." "But"
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   hates the sin because "but" should be "and." God loves the sinner and hates the sin because
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   "but" implies He doesn't hate the sinner. That's not true. God does hate sinners. Psalm
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   5 verse 4, "You are not a God who delights in wickedness. Evil may not dwell with you.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.040]   The boastful shall not stand before your eyes. You hate all evildoers." Or Psalm 11 verse
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.880]   5, "The Lord tests the righteous, but His soul hates the wicked and the one who loves
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   violence." So it's just not true to give the impression that God doesn't hate sinners
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.240]   by saying He loves the sinner and hates the sin. He does hate sinners. His wrath is real.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.120]   It's not something He pours out on people He approves of. This infinite disapproval
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   is what the Bible means when it says God hates sinners. He infinitely disapproves of them.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   Sin is not sinful except as committed by sinful hearts. Sin is an expression of anti-God human
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.240]   corruption, human hearts. Sinful volitions are owing to sinful hearts. Sin doesn't just
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.760]   hang out there with its own existence. It is in hearts, or it's nothing. Sins do not
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.000]   suffer in hell. Sinners suffer in hell. I wonder what people who say that believe about
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   hell because He's not punishing sin in hell. He's punishing sinners in hell. He hates,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   and here's the paradox, and He loves at the same time. "For God so loved the world that
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.920]   He hates." Hate and love are simultaneous as God looks upon hateful, rebellious, corrupt,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.880]   loathsome, wicked, God-dishonoring sinners. Now, here's the distinctions we need to make.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.320]   This is just so crucial. I hope people will listen carefully. Hate and love both have
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:09.920]   two meanings each. Hate can be intense loathing of a quality, or hate can be beyond that,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.000]   the intense intentionality to destroy. Love, similarly, can be an intense delighting in
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.200]   a quality, and it can be an intense intentionality to bless, even in spite of the presence of
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   some unsavory quality. So, in any given text in the Bible, we have to ask, "Is the hatred
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:50.080]   being spoken of here only an intense loathing of a quality of a person, or is it also the
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   intent to destroy?" And it's different. If you went over to Malachi 1, you'd find the
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.560]   latter, and I think some of those texts in the Psalms refer to the former. Same with
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.640]   God's love. God's love moves Him to save millions of people who, in and of themselves,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:20.360]   are loathsome to Him. Now, here's why this matters. If we don't understand that God finds
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:32.040]   us hateful and loathsome in our ugly sin, we won't be as stunned by what love is for
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:42.520]   us. God saves millions of people who, in and of themselves, are loathsome to Him until
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.600]   He saves them and makes them the apple of His eye, which makes salvation stunningly
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.080]   more. Stunningly more, if you get that. That God comes to us not in our attractiveness,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.680]   like "Oh, I really love this person and just hate their sin." No. He finds me reprehensible
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   because of my rebellion, just like we find certain wicked people reprehensible because
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.600]   of their sin. And He's coming to us, and He's dying for us in order that He might make us
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   into the apple of His eye. So God can love us with the intent to save us, even while
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:33.760]   He's hating God-despising rebels like us. And then when He saves us, He transforms us
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.200]   so that now He not only loves us with the intent to bless us forever, but He loves us
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   with an ever-increasing delight, I think, in helping us make much of Him.
