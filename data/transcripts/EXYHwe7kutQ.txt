[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.880]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.960]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about ghostwriting
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.320]   and how to help thought leaders tell their stories.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.060]   Now, one of my favorite stories of all time
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.440]   is that of Cyrano de Bergerac.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.640]   If you're not familiar,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480]   it was a play written by Edmund Rostand in 1897,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.120]   and this story, there was a man named Cyrano.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.640]   Now, he didn't consider himself to be a handsome man
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   because he had this really large nose
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.000]   that he was deeply ashamed of.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720]   Unfortunately for him, he loved a woman named Roxanne,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140]   but his fixation on his looks prevented him
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.440]   from opening up his heart to her.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.360]   Now, he had a friend named Christian,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.600]   who was this handsome Brad Pitt of a man,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.240]   who also was attracted to Roxanne,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.360]   but he didn't have the, let's say,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.040]   vocabulary to properly impress her.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.320]   So he and Cyrano made an arrangement.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.880]   Cyrano would finally get to write love letters to Roxanne,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.080]   but Christian would take credit for the letters
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   by delivering the messages to Roxanne.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.960]   It's tragic, I know.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.120]   Now, I won't spoil the ending, but you should check it out.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.560]   The essence of ghostwriting is a little bit like that.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   You have an executive audience
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.040]   who wants to deliver a message,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.560]   and a ghostwriter helps create the content
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.860]   that allows them to tell their story
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.400]   in a way that is impactful to their audience.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   So today, we're going to have a conversation
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.920]   with Troy Peterson, who is a freelance ghostwriter
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.880]   and content marketer.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.840]   In this conversation, he's going to cover topics
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.620]   such as how to write and tell a compelling story,
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.760]   how the field is challenging but highly rewarding,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.000]   and then he'll give us some tips
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   on how to start or build a career as a content marketer.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.440]   All right, let's get started.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   Hey guys, today we're talking about how to be a ghostwriter
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.840]   and how to help thought leaders get their message out.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.200]   Joining us is Troy Peterson.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.360]   Troy, how you doing?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.280]   - I'm doing great, it's good to see you, Tim.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.320]   - Good to see you, Troy.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.280]   Hey, can you tell us a little bit
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.000]   about what you're doing these days?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.480]   - Yeah, so basically I'm a ghostwriter,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.720]   which is kind of a funny word,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.080]   but my mission is to help thought leaders
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.560]   and innovators to tell stories through the written word.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.720]   Obviously there are a lot of mediums.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.920]   My focus is specifically writing.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   I help companies and leaders get their thought leadership
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.440]   in the form of lots of blog posts
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.840]   and sometimes articles that get placed
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.680]   on different industry or mass media websites.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920]   - There's one thing that you said to me once,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.880]   which just made me chuckle,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.120]   'cause it totally aligns with my philosophy as well,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.360]   and your version of this is every piece has a purpose.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.680]   And for me as a web marketer,
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.000]   my take on that is every pixel has a purpose, right?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.640]   Everything's gotta be done intentionally.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.520]   And you actually just mentioned,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.800]   whether it's contributed articles, blogs, or eBooks,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.360]   like everything has to serve a purpose.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000]   Can you help me understand what that means to you
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.480]   for each of those mediums?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.320]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.520]   No, I mean, so sometimes thought leadership
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.760]   is a little bit about ego, right?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.000]   Let's be honest.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.280]   You wanna get your ideas out there,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   you wanna sort of be in the conversation today,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.520]   especially on social media.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   But in terms of a company investing in me and in my time,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   what makes a good story?
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.920]   What makes a good thought leadership piece
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.160]   that's written for a blog
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   or for getting placed via PR on a website or media?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.480]   It really comes down to three things.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.760]   It has to be the intersection
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.440]   of a subject matters, personal passion.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.040]   There has to be an audience for it
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.560]   that's interested in that topic.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.600]   And importantly, I think people forget about this.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.400]   There has to be a business opportunity associated with it.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.480]   'Cause otherwise, why are you gonna spend the money
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.360]   and the time to get that post out there?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   So I have spent a lot of hours in my career
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.680]   looking at analytics and Google Analytics primarily
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.400]   and looking at what different pieces of content
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.560]   drive an audience interest.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.200]   And I think that is a super important element to what I do.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   And whether I'm looking at the analytics on a daily basis
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.480]   or my client stakeholder is looking at the analytics,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   we wanna understand the work that we're doing
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.800]   and what kind of an impact it's gonna make on the business.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.120]   - I love where you went there
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.640]   'cause like you, I'm a total data nerd, right?
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.000]   And the thing is, in the world of content creation,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.200]   there's science to it and there's art.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.960]   And sometimes the art comes in a form of opinions
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.200]   that may or may not be substantiated by data.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.320]   And I'm kind of curious,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.120]   as you're working with your clients
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.360]   or even just pitching a medium
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.640]   that's maybe most appropriate for a topic,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.560]   like what data are you looking at
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   and which ones kind of help you shape a recommendation
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.080]   on whether, hey, like based on whatever you're seeing
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.840]   in a trend, this should be an article
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   versus, you know what, this is probably better suited
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.000]   for a blog or even ebook.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess there's,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.840]   part of what makes a good story is also what,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   it has to drive an action, right?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.160]   So, and that ties into analytics or data.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.480]   So that action, and again,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.560]   I believe every article ought to have this, right?
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.680]   I try to ask this question every time I do an interview
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.200]   is like, what do you want your reader to do
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.960]   ultimately after they read this?
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.440]   So sometimes it's, you know, the data is simply,
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.600]   we want to drive exposure to our website, right?
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.920]   So we think about, you know, what's the,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.880]   how does the topic going to drive interest
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.960]   and whether it's, you know, keywords
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.400]   that are gonna be searchable through SEO
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.600]   or thinking about, you know, catchy headlines
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   and anecdotes that might drive people
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.040]   from an email newsletter to read it.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.000]   But, you know, the other data points
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.960]   that are sort of more impactful is
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000]   how many business discussions did we get
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.800]   actually started with this?
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.040]   Because when you think about thought leadership,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.120]   the goal is ultimately to engage in a conversation, usually.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.280]   So, you know, how many, if we, you know,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.920]   if it's a blog post and we cross posted on, you know,
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.720]   from LinkedIn or X/Twitter or Instagram,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.000]   like did we actually get people engaging with that,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.880]   engaging in a conversation, you know,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.560]   even better from a, you know, sort of B2B point of view,
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.200]   did it actually get somebody to reach out to our sales team
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.880]   or through our contact form?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.840]   And, you know, and then ultimately like the creme de la creme
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.920]   is did this article that we write start a conversation
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.720]   that ultimately led to some kind of a sale, right?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   That would be, that doesn't happen very often.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.440]   A lot of times that's the accumulation of, you know,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.520]   the thought leadership work that I do
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.960]   that ultimately will lead to a sale at different points
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.480]   in the journey, the lead journey.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   But those are the data points that we're looking for.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   - Yeah, you know, I would even add to that
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.040]   because, you know, like as the web piece of it,
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.600]   working with someone like you,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.960]   the data that's important for me,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.080]   and you called that out earlier,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.760]   is having a strong point of view, first of all,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   on who your target audience is,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.000]   and then you measure engagement, right?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   And I think if not done thoughtfully,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.440]   there is no such thing as a one size fits all, right?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.240]   So you can't just assume a template that you create
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.480]   would just work for everyone.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.960]   And I think you point out a good example
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.200]   of like a thought leadership piece.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.080]   There's a very specific audience,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.680]   executive audience you're going for.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.400]   And you can only go down to a very technical audience.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.200]   Like maybe there is a product announcement
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.280]   that's a very popular one, right?
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.840]   You write one for technical audience,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.520]   but that one is so specific,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.920]   like the engagement might be very dependent
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.560]   on like just the demand of your product,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.440]   as opposed to maybe writing a periodic piece,
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.840]   which is playing on a current trend, right?
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.160]   And to your point,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.640]   all of these have different audiences,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.840]   they have a different objective.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.880]   So you have to be very purposeful
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.800]   around like what CTAs you wanna put in there, right?
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.640]   And like I've done a few studies in the past
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.160]   where like you work so hard creating an analyst,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   like let's say a first party analyst report, right?
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.240]   Based on cool trends.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.520]   And it's easy to regurgitate key learnings
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.840]   and key findings from the report.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.880]   But what it doesn't do is put an opinion
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.560]   on why it's important for the user.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.080]   And like in both cases,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.160]   I've seen the one where if there is a thoughtful perspective
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.840]   on an industry trend of what your report supports,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.920]   that marriage usually results in higher engagement
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.600]   on clicks and gathering names for a report,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.560]   as opposed to just pure spitting out the data.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.400]   - Right.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.560]   - And written for different audiences is very powerful,
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.400]   right?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.240]   And so you're totally right.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   As a matter of fact,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.720]   a CTA on a thought leadership piece
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   might be come check out our EBC, right?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.080]   And that's a very different than come get a demo
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.160]   or download this white paper.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.000]   - Right, yeah.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.840]   - So I like that.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.000]   I've always been wondering,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.840]   you know, like,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.600]   so like between like contributed articles or blogs,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.680]   you know, they're similar in nature
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.240]   in that you're writing basically an editorial story.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.280]   E-books to me is a very, very different beast.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.800]   'Cause you have to go deep and broad
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.920]   and it's gotta be a highly valuable piece for someone
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.680]   'cause hopefully it answers jobs
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.760]   or helps them understand how to do their job better.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.600]   Right?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   - Yeah.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   - Can you give us some examples,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.200]   like just topically,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.120]   and obviously I don't have to, you know,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.400]   say the customer name or whatever it is,
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.360]   but like some examples of e-books
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   that are really, really like impactful for you.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.280]   'Cause again, anyone looking to create an e-book today
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.920]   might want some guidance on what to,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.600]   how you have to approach it.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.080]   - Right, right.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.840]   Yeah, I'm trying to think of back to some good examples,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.720]   but yeah, you know,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.640]   back to your point about different audiences.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.840]   So one of my clients is an app development firm.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.000]   Actually they were my last full employer
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.160]   before I decided to break off and go independent.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.000]   But we, early on in my work with them,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   we, you know, we decided we wanted for existing prospects.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   So if you think about the funnel,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   this is not a piece to drive awareness.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.160]   It was a piece to send,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.200]   the sales team could send to existing prospects
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.080]   to better understand what they do.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.320]   But basically the idea was to, you know,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.560]   step-by-step go through
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.600]   what the typical app development process looks like.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.320]   And it's not a perfect piece of content
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.160]   because every case is really different.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.080]   But we, you know, we talk through and explain in detail
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.200]   the different pieces and, you know, the feedback,
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.320]   you know, the ROI on that was, you know,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.560]   basically feedback from the sales team that it,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.400]   it really helped them further their discussions
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.840]   and sort of give them a nice leave behind
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   to explain their, you know, the process.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   But then also it was a great opportunity
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.520]   to reach back to sort of old leads or cold leads
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.800]   and sort of re-engage with them with a piece of content.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   Another example, we did an e-book
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.520]   about enterprise applications, same client,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.760]   enterprise mobile applications,
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.400]   and the opportunity for basically to create apps
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.320]   for your workforce that would allow them
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.160]   to do their jobs better.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.840]   So this was, this one we used more at the top of the funnel.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.800]   We used it to drive awareness.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.640]   And it was really, it was actually,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   we did a study leading up to it,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   some research about, you know,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.160]   look, we commissioned a quantitative study
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.760]   to ask workers, you know, how they felt
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.720]   about their existing tools that they use to do their job.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   And we found basically, you know,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.000]   not surprisingly a lot of dissatisfaction
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.160]   around sort of the off the shelf tools
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.120]   that companies provide them.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.800]   So basically the e-book was an overview
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.200]   of the research findings,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.760]   but put in the context of, you know,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.120]   there's an opportunity with the maturation
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.800]   of mobile applications and mobile OSs,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.000]   specifically iOS and Android,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.080]   to, for companies to fairly inexpensively
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.480]   create custom apps to support their workforce.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.120]   And we promoted it through a lot of newsletters
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   that specifically targeted HR and IT teams,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.760]   and drove quite a few new leads into this.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.960]   The system and built a newsletter list with that.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.600]   So that, those were just two examples of e-books
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.040]   that sued very different purposes,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   but I thought, you know,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.000]   both were very effective at what they did.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.480]   - That's really, really cool.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.680]   And I find myself envious of people like you,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.640]   because the skillset that's required
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.400]   or the broad set of skillsets to dive deep
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.800]   into any given topic quickly,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.200]   and to become an expert quickly,
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.120]   to be able to write something sensibly credible,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.040]   is not something that I find easy to pivot, you know?
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.200]   And I would never cut it in your world, Troy,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.600]   like I couldn't do it.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.160]   - Well, it's so man-made, I mean, it's not easy.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.920]   It's not easy for me either.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.160]   In fact, that difficulty defines really
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.640]   how I prefer to work.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.960]   It shapes how I prefer to work,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.680]   which is, and it's a bit of a challenge,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.200]   because I'm a freelancer.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.520]   I don't have the overhead of a company,
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.640]   you know, the security that comes
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.840]   with working for a company,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.120]   and I don't have HR benefits and all that stuff.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.480]   That's a whole different topic,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.600]   but, you know, to do what I do well,
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.400]   I feel like I can only work on, you know,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.320]   sort of two to four clients at a time.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.960]   So, you know, I mentioned, you know,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.560]   this app development firm that,
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.640]   happy to share the name, by the way,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.040]   it's ArcTouch, they're really good at what they do,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.520]   and they work with big brands
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.000]   and lots of big media companies
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.840]   to build their mobile products, basically.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.680]   But I've been working with them since 2014,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.080]   whether it's, you know, full-time
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.800]   or when I left in 2020.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.840]   And then, you know, even the other clients
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.400]   that I've had the most success with,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.160]   I work with over a long period of time,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.640]   and I get to know, you know,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.720]   their business really closely
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.960]   and can dive, you know, deep over time.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   But it is, you know, it is daunting,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.520]   especially if you're gonna go deep on an e-book,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.240]   if you're just starting to work with somebody,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.440]   because you're, you know,
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.600]   it's gonna be fraught with a little bit more peril
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.640]   if you try to do an e-book on day one
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.240]   of working with a client.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.880]   So my preferred working situation
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.320]   is no more than two to four clients
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   and sticking with them for a long period of time.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.280]   - Well, that's a good tip.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.040]   I think you're right.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.080]   Quantity versus quality, right?
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.200]   And giving yourself the time to really dive deep
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.320]   is really important.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.960]   You know, back to the actual discipline
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.720]   of ghostwriting itself,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.920]   to me is fascinating, right?
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.080]   'Cause I think about people who ghostwrite for presidents
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.200]   or for CEOs, right?
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.000]   And there's a art of having to understand
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.600]   their tone and personality
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.960]   to write something that genuinely looks like
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   it came from their behalf.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.400]   And it's a little different than obviously ghostwriting
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.960]   for like a blog or e-book, for example.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.800]   Can you tell us a little more about the,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.320]   just ghostwriting itself as a function
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.840]   and what it means to you,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.760]   the different applications or how to do it well?
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.200]   - Yeah, it's a complex question,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   but I'll try to break it down.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   The most important thing is to understand the context
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.480]   of somebody's work.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   And I think, you know, I've thought a lot about this a lot.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.400]   I think one of the reasons I'm able to do what I do
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.000]   is honestly my career path
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   in working in a lot of different roles.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   And specifically, you know, there's a lot,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.360]   I started as a journalist.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.000]   There's a lot of people who do what I do,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.960]   started as journalists.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   But I think the sort of secret sauce layer for me
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.240]   being able to be, to do this for as long as I have
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.760]   is that I've worked in business in different roles.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.640]   And, you know, you and I worked together at Logitech.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.040]   Logitech is a great example.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   I started in doing sort of block and tackle public relations,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.080]   media relations on their PR team.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.040]   And then I, for a year or two,
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.960]   I worked as their full-time, the full-time PR writer.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   And I wrote a lot of press releases
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.760]   and I wrote some reviewers guides.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   So basically, you know, when we had new products,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   we'd write a guide and send out a unit to a list of media
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.040]   and sort of give them tips on the best way to try it out.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.920]   But, you know, I wanted to learn,
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.000]   at that point I was super intrigued with,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.960]   started to get super intrigued
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.080]   with the sort of product development.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   I loved Logitech's products, still do.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.760]   And I had an opportunity to shift over
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.320]   to the gaming group and become actually,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.120]   I was a global product manager there for a couple of years
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.880]   and also did some game developer relations.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.400]   So I did some business development
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.440]   and I learned about operations
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.160]   and I learned about product development
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.320]   and I learned about supply chain
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.720]   and how to build materials in a spreadsheet
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.240]   and understand the, you know, sort of ROI.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.200]   So tons of great learnings in that.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.560]   And then, you know, after Logitech,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.000]   I did a lot of different sort of digital marketing
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.800]   'cause digital became the thing.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   So I've had this broad experience in business.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.360]   So I think I have this built-in context.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.160]   Everything's a little different, right?
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.920]   But I have this sort of built-in context
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.480]   that allows me to understand
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.200]   when I'm talking with somebody,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.880]   a new thought leader that I haven't talked to before,
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.360]   to usually at least on the surface level,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.160]   understand their business context and their work context.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.680]   And, you know, and then it's just a matter of like,
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.960]   you know, going back to journalism school
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.000]   and, you know, knowing how to ask questions
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.080]   and even beyond that, being curious, right?
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.880]   Being curious, asking, just like you're, you know,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.320]   sitting at a bar with friends
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.400]   or around a campfire with kids, you know,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.440]   asking questions and being naturally curious
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.680]   and listening, right?
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.480]   That's the last part is listening.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   And so all of those things, I think,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   combine to allow me to do what I do.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.840]   You know, the challenge of,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.320]   you mentioned of sort of tone and voice,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.720]   it's important.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.120]   And I think that comes through some trial and error
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.360]   when I'm first working with somebody
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.720]   and kind of goes back to the point I made earlier about,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.440]   I prefer to have longer engagements with people
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.520]   because as I go along and I learn their style
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.480]   through more conversation and more access,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.880]   then I can better sort of channel their voice
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.560]   and, you know, turn it into something on my first try
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.280]   that they're happy with, proud of, to put their name on.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.720]   - As a writer, how do you deal with
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.680]   just harsh criticism and feedback?
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.480]   That would probably break me down as a human.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.960]   So I'm pretty sure, like you mentioned,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.200]   like it's been a journey for you
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.760]   and I'm pretty sure you learn a lot of things on the way
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   to build a thick skin.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.440]   Like how do you process criticism?
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.680]   Like how do you do it?
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.600]   - Well, yeah, I mean, you have to,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.120]   it's human nature to get defensive, right?
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.480]   And I think I get defensive like everybody else.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.480]   I try to minimize reacting in the moment, right?
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.440]   And just try to take it in.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.680]   And if, 'cause your brain's first instinct
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.200]   is to shut it down.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.400]   So it's just, I don't have a great answer for that
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.840]   other than you have to on some level be okay
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.040]   with feedback that you're not always gonna agree with.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.160]   And then the real trick is to turn that feedback
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.360]   that you may not agree with
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.800]   and then find a compromise,
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.600]   if that's what it takes to finish your work
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.640]   that you're proud of.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.000]   But ultimately you also have to know,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.120]   like if it's a ghostwriting gig
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.400]   and this person's name is going to appear on top of it,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.960]   they have to be proud of it, right?
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.480]   So you have to get to that point where they're proud.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.040]   And I actually kind of relish that challenge.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.240]   I've just seen my name on stuff once in a while,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.200]   but it's a totally unique challenge
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.560]   to get somebody to sign off on like something
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.880]   that you basically wrote that has their name on it.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.440]   - Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.720]   Shifting gears a little quick for here.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.360]   So what advice would you give to someone
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.840]   who is at the start of their career going,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.040]   and they generally know that they like writing,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   they don't know what to do with that.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.120]   So what advice would you give them?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.680]   And then alternatively,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.720]   for someone who is a little more seasoned,
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.880]   what advice would you give them
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.760]   in terms of what they should consider
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.960]   when evaluating future moves in a career and whatnot?
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.720]   - So my advice early in your career
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.960]   would be to start broadly.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.840]   When I first made the transition,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   I went to a tech PR agency when I left newspapers.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.280]   And by working at a tech PR agency,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.240]   I was able to start getting exposure
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.400]   to different businesses,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.200]   whether a lot of B2C, a lot of B2B,
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.600]   understanding customers,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.680]   understanding the media landscape,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.680]   understanding audiences
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.280]   and what motivates different audiences
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.960]   and how to sort of start to create messaging
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.480]   targeted at different audiences.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.720]   And that's a great foundation.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.800]   I wouldn't recommend anybody that's coming out of college
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   or early in their career to specialize too much, honestly.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.560]   You wanna know what you're good at and really good at,
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.120]   and you can sort of hang your hat on that,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.920]   but it's really important to have that,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.360]   to sort of get a broader context to do your job well
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.280]   and understand a bigger landscape.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.400]   'Cause as I said, I think that's something
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.000]   that has allowed me to have that context
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.560]   when I'm having those first conversations
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.520]   with thought leaders today
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.680]   is to sort of point back to those broader experiences
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.080]   that I had earlier in my career.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.520]   When it comes to leaders
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.400]   that maybe wanted to focus more on writing
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.520]   or be ghostwriting later in their career,
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   I mean, I think if you realize that like me,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:55.720]   you really relish the storytelling above all else
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.120]   and you relish this idea of helping businesses
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.720]   get their thought leadership out
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.400]   and actually achieve some kind of ROI out of it,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.600]   which is what I do.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.480]   That's the time to consider it.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.760]   I think there's two ways to go.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.560]   There's one would be to work at a bigger agency
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.960]   where maybe you have benefits and things like that.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.880]   Bigger marketing agencies,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.920]   a lot of them have internal writers these days.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Sometimes really big companies have content marketers,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.360]   they call them, that do a lot of writing,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.560]   so that's another path.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.400]   If you get to my point in my career
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.320]   where I've been doing this for a while
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   and I've got a decent professional network,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   then you can think about freelancing.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.000]   I haven't, I've been lucky,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.720]   I haven't had to do a whole lot of marketing,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.040]   but there's definitely ups and downs
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.680]   that you have to be prepared for when you're freelancing.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.760]   - But Troy, those are super, super helpful conversation
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.720]   for me 'cause you reminded me of a lot of really good things
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.520]   and even in the web marketing world,
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.400]   like a lot of muscles to exercise.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.200]   And I would agree with your statement around
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.600]   starting your career as a generalist, right?
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.400]   I think I also started my career
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.920]   in a agency side of the business,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.720]   and you just get exposed to so many different aspects
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.560]   of that discipline, I totally agree.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.520]   Kind of coming back full circle,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.680]   as kind of just kind of closing thoughts,
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.880]   again, every piece having a purpose is so important, right?
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.440]   And if you're entering this field,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.880]   being intimately familiar with your audiences
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.720]   and the mediums of what you're gonna write for
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.760]   is really important.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.000]   Do you have any closing thoughts for us, Troy?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.040]   - No, I mean, I do think AI is interesting right now.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.800]   Like I said earlier, Tim,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I have some mixed feelings about AI,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.760]   but I think one of the reasons why I believe
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.000]   there's gonna be people like me for a very long time
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.040]   is AI is great at helping look back
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.600]   and assimilate background knowledge on things,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.840]   but in terms of AI's role in writing,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.480]   it can't, at least right now, it can't really lead, right?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   So we still have, our leaders are human,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.800]   our innovators are human.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   They're using AI tools to lead and to innovate,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.000]   but in terms of telling their stories,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I think we're a long way away from AI
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.960]   being able to look forward and to lead, right?
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.960]   Which is something only humans can do.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.280]   So yeah, aside from that, I think I'm good, Tim.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.160]   I've really enjoyed having this conversation with you
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.040]   and love your podcast.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.520]   (laughing)
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.360]   - Thanks a lot, Troy.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.200]   - Great having you on.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.840]   We'll have to bring you back on this show
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.200]   'cause there's other things I wanna talk to you about
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.600]   that has nothing to do with ghostwriting,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.520]   but I just love to get your perspective on stuff,
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   but thank you for following it.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.360]   For more information on Troy and information,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.520]   just follow the descriptions below.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.600]   Troy, thank you for your time.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.440]   - Awesome, thanks, Tim.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.480]   I appreciate being on.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.120]   (gentle music)
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:35.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
