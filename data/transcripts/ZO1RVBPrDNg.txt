[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Today is October 14th on the podcast and the date marks the 40th anniversary of Pastor
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.240]   John's late night wrestling over a huge decision.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   Should he leave seminary as a professor in order to take up a full-time pastorate in
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   a local church?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.940]   Pastor John, take us back to that season of life and I think it's related.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.800]   We have a question here from a listener named Vanessa who asks, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   I hope you are well.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440]   I, like so many others, are thankful for your ministry.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.640]   My question for you is this.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   Does God have a specific plan for my life or do I have freedom to choose what I want
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.000]   to do and God will work in that?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.760]   Two good career options are in front of me.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.380]   Neither would be bad or sinful.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.840]   When faced with two good options, how have you made decisions?"
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   And of course, in this context, take us back to that anniversary.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.840]   Tony, this was really moving for me, for you to force me to think about this.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.680]   I didn't know until you pointed it out that we were coming up on the 40th anniversary
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.120]   of that night in October 1979 when God did such an amazing work in my life.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.520]   This is amazing.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.300]   What a night it was.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.440]   So I have in front of me here on my desk—I'm going to rattle it so you can hear it so you
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.540]   can hear the paper—I have in front of me the actual handwritten Blue Book pages in
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.960]   volume 25 of my thought notebook, which I began to keep in 1966.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:49.240]   And this one is dated June 22, 1979 to November 21, 1979, so it contains this epic-making
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.780]   night for me personally of October 14.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.360]   And I'm going to read part of it eventually, but in just a minute.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.400]   But first, a word about Vanessa's question.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.360]   "Does God have a specific plan for my life, or do I have freedom to choose what I want
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.440]   to do, and God will work in that?
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.960]   Two good career options are in front of me," that's what she says.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.260]   "God's sovereign will for your life, Vanessa, is going to happen no matter what.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.760]   The mind of a woman plans her way, but the Lord directs her steps," Proverbs 19.21,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   applied to you.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.220]   You plan, He directs.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.880]   Good to plan, He's decisive.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.820]   His revealed will, His will of command, the will that He reveals for us to do in the Bible,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.340]   is what He tells us to do in Scripture.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.020]   You should always pursue that, always.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.740]   But those commands do not specify explicitly which career to choose, right?
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.920]   So what do we do?
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.780]   We do six things.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.900]   We make it our aim to be radically holy in every part of our lives.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.700]   Two, we seek to be Bible-saturated, shaped through and through by Scripture.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.820]   Three, we seek to know ourselves, the way God has made us, our spiritual gifts.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.020]   Four, we seek to be aware of the needs of the world that we could touch.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.900]   Five, we soak all of this in prayer every day for God's wisdom and leading.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.580]   Psalm 25, especially valuable for this.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.860]   And six, in it all, we live in a worshiping community of love so that at every step along
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.060]   the way, fellow believers are speaking into our lives.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.340]   And then, with those six steps in place, there come these critical moments in our lives when
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.420]   two paths are in front of us, neither is sin.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.260]   So one of those critical moments for me, one of the most pivotal moments of my life
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.420]   was midnight, almost, October 14, 1979.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.620]   So I want to read just a few excerpts from the seven or nine pages that I wrote there
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:38.460]   so that you can get inside how God used my wrestling, and it might shed light on your
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.460]   own wrestling.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.980]   I was employed as a teacher, professor of Bible at Bethel College, had worked there
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:54.620]   for six years, and the question was, "Would I leave this very happy and fruitful job and
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.260]   seek a pastorate?"
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.660]   Which I had never had before.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.380]   Two good options, right?
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.340]   So here's what I wrote.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.740]   I am closer tonight to actually deciding to resign at Bethel and take a pastorate than
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.780]   I have ever been.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.740]   I'm not kidding.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.300]   The urge is almost overwhelming.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.260]   It takes this form.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.380]   I am enthralled by the reality of God and the power of His Word to create authentic
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.380]   people.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.020]   And I believe, I really believe, that God has made me a vessel of His Word, which when
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.960]   poured onto people, changes them in this direction.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.860]   But I'm not wholly deluded.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.220]   I know, I really know, I would despair as a pastor.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.740]   I would despair that my people are not where I want them to be.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.020]   I would despair at the ruptured study and the writing goals.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.260]   I would despair at barren administrative details.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.980]   I'm skipping something, you can hear the pages rattle.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.120]   What then would I lose?
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.500]   I would lose the simplicity of task and routine in the college.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.700]   My life and time would be much less my own.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.140]   I would lose the serenity of undisturbed hours of study and self-imposed hours of leisure
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.020]   because the needs of the flock are unpredictable.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.660]   I would lose the quiet of the study and trade it for hours in the car on the way to the
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.300]   hospital and to homes.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:44.500]   I would lose the uniformity of responsibility and be swamped by dozens of different tasks,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.580]   many of which would no doubt be distasteful unless and until my palate changed.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.660]   I would lose the collegial stimulation of fellow theologians in return for a draining
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.100]   ministry to the hungry.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.340]   I would lose an almost total occupation with theological subject matter and inherit the
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.220]   press for programs and functions.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.380]   I would lose the ease of having to reckon with no visible failure.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.140]   If I fail with students, they pass on quickly.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.860]   But in a church, I must reckon with the possibility nothing happens.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.580]   People become discontented.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.740]   No one is being one to Christ.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.860]   Old animosities remain unhealed.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.420]   If I only think of all the satanic might-bes, I despair already.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.700]   But is this any way to make a choice?
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.340]   Great God, what is faith?
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:56.820]   If not trusting you for the life-transforming work of your spirit through the ministry of
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.140]   the Word.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:05.580]   I think what has happened is a gradual clarification of what my highest values are and the most
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.140]   fruitful way to achieve them.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.580]   Those values are to see the Word of God produce people of great faith and great love.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.900]   That is why Paul stayed and did not set sail for Christ in Philippians 1.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.500]   "For your advancement and the joy of your faith," he said.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.820]   This was how he magnified Christ in his body by life.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.260]   And that is my greatest goal of all, to magnify and exalt and display Christ in the world
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.100]   and in heaven.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:47.900]   By seeing people transformed into new creatures of love and faith through his Word and Spirit.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:55.300]   This moment of indecision is real and makes me feel on the brink of doing something that
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:04.620]   could be so revolutionary for me and for some group of people that I do not want it to be
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.660]   set aside now and say, "Oh, it will pass.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.460]   You have felt this way before.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.540]   You get over it.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.740]   You realize it was just a moment of dissatisfied fantasy."
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.820]   No.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:29.900]   The recurrence is now too frequent, and tonight, it is almost midnight now, too strong.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.980]   I will seek counsel and pray.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:43.220]   My last word is this, I cannot decide now, but I know which side I want to win, the pastorate.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.660]   That's the end of my journal entry.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:53.860]   And before I went to bed, maybe an hour later, the die was cast.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:01.580]   All that remained was to see if my wife, Noelle, felt the same in the morning, and she did.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:09.380]   And in June the next year, we began a 33-year pastorate at Bethlehem.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.700]   So that's how it happened for me.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.700]   God is faithful.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.300]   So, Vanessa, may he guide you.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   He will.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   Yeah, amen.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   That's incredible.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.260]   Thank you for taking us back into that season and recounting for us that long night, Pastor
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260]   John, and what you learned and what we can apply from it.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   That's really helpful.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.060]   And thanks for subscribing to Ask Pastor John in your favorite podcast app or on YouTube.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.540]   We appreciate having you along as you wrestle through all the complicated decisions of life.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.700]   Well, should you stop listening to this podcast, and when and why?
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.500]   I don't know what sort of question that is.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.180]   It's kind of crazy to ask it, but it's a question I'm going to ask Pastor John next time.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you Wednesday when I ask Pastor John, "When
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.820]   should I stop listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast?"
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   That should be interesting.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.320]   [End]
