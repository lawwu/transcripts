[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.520]   the second book of Kings, chapter 5, and looking particularly at the first verse.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.240]   "Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.620]   and honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.000]   He was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.280]   Now there is the first verse in this chapter which records for us this extraordinary story
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.580]   of this man, Naaman, the captain of the hosts of the king of Syria.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.400]   I am calling your attention to it this evening, and God willing also next Sunday evening,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.380]   because it seems to me to provide us with a very striking and wonderful illustration
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:07.880]   of a principle which is taught everywhere in the scripture, and which is a very vital
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.940]   principle in connection with the whole of Christian salvation.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.980]   We have been a number of Sunday evenings looking together at the message of the gospel, particularly
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.580]   to a certain type of person, as typified, for instance, in the Pharisees, of whom we
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.500]   read in the gospels.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.060]   Now that is an aspect of the truth which is put prominently forward in many places in
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.820]   the scripture.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.700]   And here I am suggesting this evening we have got a wonderful illustration of that in terms
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700]   of an Old Testament story.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.220]   Now nothing is more important than that we should realize that the message of this book
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.020]   is really but one.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.300]   Two testaments, one book, one message.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.700]   And what is that message?
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.060]   Well the great message of the Bible, the great object of the Bible, is really to deal with
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.060]   just one thing, and that one thing is man in his relationship to God.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.580]   The Bible is the most practical book in the world.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.420]   There are foolish people who say that they are so practical they have got no time to
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.900]   read the Bible or to listen to sermons out of the Bible.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.100]   We want to get on with life, they say.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.980]   Well of course the Bible is a book that has just one object, and that is to enable us
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.700]   to get on with life.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.020]   That is what it is for.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.900]   It is not a theoretical book at all.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.940]   It is a book that comes to us exactly where we are to tell us the cause of our troubles,
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.780]   and to tell us about the only way in which we can be delivered from those troubles.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.780]   Now it does that in the Old Testament as well as in the New.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.620]   There is only one real difference between the two testaments, and that is the form,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.580]   if you like, in which the message is presented.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.540]   In the Old Testament you have types, prophecies, looking forward, you have got the shadows
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.740]   suggesting the substance.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.260]   In the New Testament you see the great thing itself in all its fullness, but the same thing
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.700]   is operating in the Old as in the New.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.580]   The Apostle Paul is always telling us in his epistles that there is only one way of salvation,
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.540]   and that is by faith alone.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.020]   Abraham was saved by faith as much as was the Apostle Paul.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.700]   Abel was saved by faith.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.420]   Take that great eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, that is what it is telling
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.420]   us.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.820]   All these men were saved by faith.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.940]   There is only one way of knowing God and being saved and being delivered from this evil world
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.940]   and from the devil, and that is this way of faith.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.060]   So you see, you have got it everywhere in the Old Testament in these great characters
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.500]   such as Abel and Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, the great prophets, and many others.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.340]   The same thing then you see in the Old Testament as in the New.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.180]   And in a very interesting way, you have got people stumbling at this message in exactly
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.820]   the same way in the Old as you have in the New.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.340]   And this man Naaman, whose story we are looking at tonight, is one of these great illustrations,
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.260]   just with respect to that particular aspect of the problem.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.660]   So as we look at this man, we shall be looking at a portrayal in this pictorial, dramatic
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.140]   manner which is so customary in the Old Testament.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:08.660]   But we shall see the selfsame principles as are taught so explicitly and more clearly
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.460]   in the New Testament.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.460]   But I am doing this deliberately for this reason.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.620]   I think we are all helped by an illustration.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.820]   We have been concentrating for a number of Sunday evenings on the doctrine, on the teaching,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.820]   on the principles.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.500]   Well, now, some of us may be helped perhaps if we see all this in a concrete instance,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.260]   in an example, in a portrait.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.820]   And there we see again the kindness of God.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.500]   He stoops to us.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.540]   He is so concerned to help us.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.240]   He does not only give the teaching.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.780]   He gives the pictures, the illustrations, the stories.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.940]   It does not matter how you arrive at the truth as long as you get there.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   If you get it through the story, well, it is all right.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.780]   If you get it directly, it is equally all right.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.540]   So by one way or another, we arrive at this knowledge of truth.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.620]   But occasionally I say it is good that we should look at this great question, this great
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.820]   principle in the terms of a picture or a portrait.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.220]   Very well, let us look at this man, Nerman the Cyrican, and see what we can gather here
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.220]   about this great truth that is stored everywhere in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.220]   What is it?
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.460]   Well, here is the first thing.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:37.260]   That which spoils life is sin.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.460]   That is the first great message that strikes us here at once, that sin is something which
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.580]   spoils life.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.580]   Listen to it.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.180]   Now Nerman, captain of the host, he was captain, remember, captain of the host of the king
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:58.540]   of Syria, was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.380]   given deliverance into Syria.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.700]   He was also a mighty man in valor.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.260]   Here is the citation you see.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.100]   This man has been honored by the king, and here is the citation.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.300]   This is why he has been honored, such a remarkable man, a man of natural ability, great powers,
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.060]   great prowess, a man who had been highly successful in conducting his campaigns, and because of
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.540]   that he was a great man with his master.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.940]   Here it is, he seems to be rising from step to step.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.500]   He seems well nigh perfect.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.220]   And then comes this little word, this little word "but."
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.620]   But he was a leper.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.260]   Now there you know, in just that phrase, you really have got everything that the Bible
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.060]   tells us about sin.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.500]   Let me hold it before you.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.780]   It is conveyed perfectly by this picture of leprosy.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.740]   Leprosy in the Old Testament and in the New ever stands as a kind of type of sin.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.020]   It is an illustration of sin.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.580]   Now I want to consider this with you both in general and in particular, because we are
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.260]   all aware of this, are we not, and we are all agreed about this, that there is something
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.180]   which is spoiling life.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:33.980]   There are so many things that are good about life today, and yet you know, it is probably
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.980]   true to say, isn't it, that not one of us would be in this building at this moment were
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.300]   it not for the fact that we know that there is something that is spoiling life at the
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.020]   same time.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:53.300]   We know that about life in general, we know it in our individual lives and experiences.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.940]   Now how easy it would be tonight.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:03.300]   For me to give you a list of the excellencies of this twentieth century, all that has been
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:11.020]   so true in this extraordinary century, all the advances in knowledge, particularly scientific
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.940]   knowledge, the great strides, the phenomenal strides that have taken place in the realm
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.820]   of medicine and the healing of diseases, the strides and advances that have taken place
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:31.100]   in housing, education, culture, everybody is better off today, never had it so good,
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   and so on.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   You are familiar with all that.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:40.020]   Well, if you look at life on the surface, you might tend to say everything is all right.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.180]   But nobody says that everything is all right.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.220]   This fatal but seems to come in.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.180]   And it is always there, it has been there throughout this century.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.060]   For instance, if you cast your minds back to the thirties, those of us who are old enough
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.780]   to do so, the tendency then was to say, you know, everything would have been all right
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.780]   but this man Hitler.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.860]   And it is always like that.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.220]   Everything is all right, everything would be perfect but, if it were not, but it is
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.540]   always there.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.060]   And so it is at the present time.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.540]   The world is like this, me and Ne'em and the Syrians.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.300]   You can say this is true of it, that is true of it, how marvelous, how wonderful, the world
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.940]   has never been so wonderful as it is tonight.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.180]   We have never had so many amenities.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:40.020]   The poor are disappearing, everybody is being lifted up, circumstances, conditions, everything
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.020]   is better.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   But is it perfect?
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.420]   No, it is not.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.940]   There is something wrong.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:56.020]   There is something there, like this leprosy, that seems to spoil it all.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.340]   Insecurity about the future.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.780]   Is all this prosperity going to last?
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.580]   What is the world going to do?
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.420]   Are we working up for another war or are we not?
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.660]   Just when you think everything is perfect, this 'but' comes in and everything seems
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.220]   to be spoiled, as it were.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.100]   It does not seem to be much, but there it is and you cannot get rid of it.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.740]   Now there it is looking at it in general.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.940]   Take it in particular and you find exactly the same thing.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:33.060]   The life of man, according to the Bible, ever since sin entered in, has never been whole.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.060]   It has never been entire.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:40.020]   Now, man, as God made him at the beginning, was entire.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.300]   His life was whole.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.620]   There was nothing lacking in the Garden of Eden, nothing at all.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.780]   Man had been made perfect in correspondence with God, enjoying it.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.100]   There was his food, he had but to pick it and to eat it.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.100]   There was nothing lacking at all.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.380]   No disappointment, no unhappiness, nothing going wrong at all.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.140]   God looked at it all and he saw that it was good.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:12.900]   Now I say the characteristic of life there was this wholeness, this perfection.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:19.900]   There it was with no blemish, with nothing at all detracting from it.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.140]   Then that fatal thing called sin came in.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.540]   And you see what sin has done has been to rob life of its wholeness and of its completeness,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.500]   of its perfection.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.700]   And so the life of every one of us can be described in this way.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.860]   We are this, that, and the other.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.380]   Life has, I say, been spoiled and ruined by sin.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.380]   It detracts from this positive wholeness and completeness and perfection.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.980]   Now let me illustrate it just in two or three respects for you to see what a perfect description
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.580]   this is.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:05.380]   However successful a man is in this world and in this life, his life is never perfect.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.140]   There's no such thing as perfect and complete success.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.140]   There's no such thing as perfect and complete happiness.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:18.660]   There's no such thing as perfect and complete and entire peace.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.180]   Nothing to me is more instructive when you read the biographies or the autobiographies
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.900]   of the world's great men.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.820]   As to see this very point which is made here by this word "but".
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.620]   There you see a man, a very able man and an ambitious man.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.900]   He says to himself and to his wife and children and to the family, "Now if only I get there,
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   everything's going to be all right."
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   He gets there.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.940]   But he doesn't find that everything's all right.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.780]   There's always something detracting.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.460]   Now I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being realistic.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.860]   I'm simply telling you what you'll find described, as I say, in these biographies.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860]   And you'll see it in the novels.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.860]   If he's a true novelist, if he's not merely a man who's out to be popular, if he really
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.780]   is a man who portrays life, this is what you'll find everywhere.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:16.980]   In other words, it is what a philosopher once called the tragic sense of life.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.060]   There's always a fly in the ointment.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.380]   There is always something that is detracting from the perfection of the thing we think
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.380]   we've got.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.180]   You've got to that great position, yes, but you're aware that people are jealous of you
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:39.380]   and they're envious of you, and that they're waiting and watching for you to make a mistake,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.140]   many of them perhaps waiting for you to fall altogether in order that they may get there,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.340]   wouldn't be at all disappointed or unhappy if you had taken ill and had to retire.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.700]   You know all that, and it just spoils everything.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:58.460]   Ah, the poet has put it for us, "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.980]   Why does he lie uneasily?
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.620]   Well, he knows that there's another man who'd like to have it, and who's got a dagger concealed
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.620]   somewhere.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.220]   "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.780]   He's got there, he's got the crown, he's reached the acme.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.900]   He's not perfectly happy, there's this fatal buck that comes in.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.700]   There is something wrong.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.980]   The Bible's full of this.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.220]   Here's one instance here, but you know in the book of Esther, there's another equally
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.220]   good story.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:32.740]   You remember that man Haman, who was a great favorite with his king, Ahasuerus, and he'd
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   been exalted.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.340]   He'd got everything, and he thought he was so great that nothing could spoil him, so
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.900]   he let it be known that whenever he passed along the streets, everybody had to bow to
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.900]   him.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:51.780]   And you know, everybody did bow to him, but one man, a man called Mordecai.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:58.540]   And though this man Haman had everybody bowing to him, he was miserable.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.580]   This one man wouldn't do it, and because one man wouldn't do it, it spoiled the whole thing
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.660]   for him.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.880]   And he went back and complained to his wife, he was miserable, and he was unhappy.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.100]   This man had been honored by the king, put into the supreme position.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.420]   The king had given him his ring to put on his finger.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.580]   He could issue an edict, it would be carried out.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.620]   He was virtually with the power of a king, and everybody bowing to him.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.060]   Yes, but there was one man who wouldn't do it, and it spoiled the whole thing.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.420]   He went back with his face lowering, his brow furrowed.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.140]   His wife said, "What's the matter with you?"
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.340]   He said, "There's this man, Mordecai.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.380]   He won't bow to me."
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.180]   What a parable, what a picture of life.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:44.420]   Yes, he was a great man with his master and honorable because by him, the lord had given
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   deliverance to Syria.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.820]   He was also a mighty man in valor, but...
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.420]   He was a leper.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.020]   And it seemed to detract from the whole thing.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.260]   It is then sometimes, as I say other people, but sometimes it's a man himself, his own
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.860]   temperament, his own constitution.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:13.020]   Read the stories of people who excel in their professions, in their art, whatever it is.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.460]   Get to know the story behind the scenes, and you'll find that they're victims of their
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.660]   own temperament.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.020]   You see them performing, and you say, "Oh, marvelous."
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.500]   If you knew what they were going through before they went on, or even while they're doing
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:29.780]   it, or what happens afterwards, you would scarcely credit it.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:37.340]   Some constitutional trouble, nerves, sense of strain.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.820]   The success seems to be endless.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.920]   It seems almost perfect.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:47.460]   But you rarely get to know the person, and you'll find this leprosy, this running sore,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.780]   how delicately parched and balanced it all is.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.780]   Or sometimes it may be some trouble in the family.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.100]   And thus, you see, we all spend our lives as natural human beings.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:04.660]   And this is what we say most frequently, "If only, if only."
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.740]   But there's always something.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.780]   Something which seems to spoil the whole thing.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.060]   And this, of course, is the great problem of life.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.260]   This is rarely the explanation of so many of the divorces.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.460]   A man says, "Well, now, of course, I've done this and that and the other, but I'm unfortunate.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   I made a mistake.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.820]   My wife doesn't seem to understand.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.220]   She can't keep going with me.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.220]   If only."
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220]   He tries again.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:33.820]   You see, this but, the fatal leprosy that always keeps on coming in, and just spoiling
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:39.100]   life, just detracting from the great and the phenomenal success.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.860]   "Oh," says the Bible, "there is no peace," saith my God to the wicked.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.780]   It doesn't matter how wonderful, how far he may go.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.740]   There is no peace to the wicked.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.740]   Sin is leprosy.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.820]   It just comes in and spoils the whole picture.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.900]   Well, there is one thing we see.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.140]   But you know, sin isn't merely something that detracts from happiness.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:07.620]   It is something that positively makes us unhappy.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.420]   You follow the life of sin the way of the world, and you'll know misery.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.420]   You'll know unhappiness.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.740]   You can't help it.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.180]   Remorse is bound to come.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.020]   You'll cause pain to yourself.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.780]   You'll cause pain to others.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.020]   Sin causes positive unhappiness.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.900]   The trouble with this man was not only that it seemed to be detracting from all he'd got.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.660]   He was positively miserable.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.380]   He was suffering, actually, in a positive sense.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.580]   And wherever there is sin, there is pain, there is sorrow.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.460]   The stale, sad music of humanity.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.180]   The pathos of life, the tragic sense of life.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.180]   What's it due to?
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.300]   "Oh," says the Bible, "it's due to sin.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.420]   Life was never meant to be like this, but sin always leads to trouble.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.620]   The way of the transgressor is hard."
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.020]   Then look at it in this way, the ugliness and the offensive character of sin.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   Leprosy.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.180]   A terrible thing, a revolting thing, a horrible thing.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.100]   And that was the thing from which this man suffered.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.980]   I don't want to stay with these things this evening, but I'm just trying to show you that
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.940]   this is what the Bible says is the cause of all the trouble.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.100]   Sin is ugly.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.100]   Sin is foul.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.260]   Look at it.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.260]   Really look at it.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.260]   Don't merely read the paper.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.900]   Look at the thing that it's describing.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:42.100]   See it, the dishonesty, the pretense, the sham, the cunning, the stealth.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.420]   All the things to which it stoops, all the things upon which it tramples.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:53.300]   Is there anything which is quite as ugly and as offensive and as foul as sin?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.260]   Hasn't life become terribly ugly?
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.260]   Well, it's due to this very thing.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.780]   We are all talking about these problems, we are bemoaning them, but the question is, what
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.780]   are they due to?
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.860]   And that's the answer.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.820]   This is sin.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.780]   This is leprosy.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.460]   And the last point I make, therefore, about it at this point is that it is something which
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:17.300]   is no respecter of persons.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:25.020]   This was a great man with his master, a man of great valor, a man of great success.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.020]   He was a leper.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.060]   It doesn't matter who we are nor what we are, it's true.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.380]   Read the biographies of kings and of queens and of captains and of prime ministers, men
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.980]   at their best in every walk of life, you'll always find it.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.540]   We are all subject to it.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.620]   We are all suffering from it.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.100]   Sin, the universal problem.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.340]   Oh, you see, this brings us all to a common denominator.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.900]   There is no success and failure here.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.180]   We're all failures.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.380]   We've all got this terrible leprosy of the soul.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.540]   Well now, then, there is the first point that I make.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:08.740]   The Bible tells us that the thing that really is making life what it is, and spoiling life
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:16.180]   and ruining it and making it ugly, is this terrible thing which it calls sin.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.580]   Then look at the second point which comes out here so clearly.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:28.820]   Men at his very best and at his highest cannot deal with this problem.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.660]   That's the essence of the story of this man Naaman, isn't it?
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.380]   Here he is, you see, and everything is spoiled because he's got this leprosy.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.380]   Well, obviously.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.900]   He had gone to his doctor and he'd gone to the other doctors and all the doctors.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.620]   He was such an important man.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.620]   And they'd all done their best, but poor Naaman still goes on suffering.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.820]   And the disease gets worse and worse and nothing can be done.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.260]   Indeed, you notice that we are told here very definitely and explicitly that even the kings
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.260]   are baffled.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.220]   Here is his own master, the king of Syria.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.920]   What wouldn't he have done to be able to cure this great man, this favorite of his, Naaman?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.820]   But he couldn't do it.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.620]   And then he hears of somebody in Israel.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.020]   He says, "Very well, I'll write a letter to my brother, the king of Israel, and I'll send
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   Naaman to him."
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.260]   And you remember, we see Naaman going, "And here is the poor king of Israel."
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:26.220]   Suddenly this man arrives at his doorstep with a letter from the other king asking that
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.420]   he may cure him.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.660]   And listen to what we are told.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.420]   It came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.660]   said, "Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   a man of his leprosy?
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.220]   Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me."
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.960]   He couldn't cure him.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.300]   The king of Syria couldn't.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.860]   The king of Israel couldn't.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.980]   They were both completely helpless.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.540]   All their magicians, all their physicians, all their great men, and they themselves.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.500]   They can do nothing at all with respect to the problem.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.100]   Do you see it?
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:13.580]   That's an epitome of the whole history of civilization for you.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.100]   That's the story of the human race.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:25.340]   That is literally the whole story of mankind's quest throughout known centuries and known
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.340]   history.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.780]   "What do you mean?" says someone.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.020]   "Well, what I mean is this, that ever since the dawn of history man has been aware of
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.780]   this trouble in his life, in particular and in general, and he's been trying to deal with
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.140]   it."
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.180]   That is the story, I say, of all the thinking and the research and the science and all the
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:54.100]   delving into the mysteries, trying to find a cure, trying to get rid of this thing.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.820]   It's the story of civilization and all its greatest achievements.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.980]   But never has it been more true than it is at this present hour.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.060]   I see the world this evening in the precise position that is depicted here.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.380]   Here is man and the leper.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.380]   That's all of us.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.380]   That's society.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.380]   That's every one of us by nature.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.380]   There is the leprosy.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.260]   And the world is trying to get rid of it.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:27.100]   And the world is completely failing to do so.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.620]   Now I say that this is the story of humanity, the story of civilization.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.180]   How has the world been trying to do it?
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.540]   Well, go back to primitive times.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   Go back to the most primitive societies that you can ever read of or find anywhere in history
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.540]   or find today.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.540]   And do you know what you'll find?
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.380]   Well, you'll find that they've got tribal laws.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.980]   What's the point of a tribal law?
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.180]   Why do these primitive races of people have these laws?
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.300]   Well, that's just their bungling way of trying to deal with the problem, trying to
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.260]   get a certain amount of order into the chaos and the confusion.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.980]   Tribal laws, that's what they're doing.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.540]   They're trying to heal the leprosy.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:20.860]   Then come up the scale a bit and you come to governments, kings, emperors, governments,
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:26.460]   whether elected popularly or whether selected from above, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.940]   The whole notion of government is still the same.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.220]   It is an attempt to deal with this problem and to solve it and to get rid of it and to
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.500]   set men free from this fatal leprosy.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.740]   You see, look at it in terms of acts of parliament.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.980]   That's the meaning of every act of parliament.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.740]   It's to try and to bring order into life, to try and get rid somehow or other of this
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.540]   chaos, to give men relief and release.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.140]   Improve his lot, we are told.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.660]   Then you'll emancipate him.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.060]   I've been finding out this so frequently.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:04.060]   We were told, you see, until about, well, until after the end of this last war, that
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:13.380]   the real cause, the most drastic cause of the ills of mankind was poverty.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.500]   And if we could only get rid of poverty by means of acts of parliament or new arrangements
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.140]   or new economic laws and enactments, if only men could be delivered from poverty, you deliver
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.620]   them from sin.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.820]   Well, we've got rid of the poverty, haven't we?
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.980]   What is our major problem today?
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:38.420]   Well, we are being told by the sociologists that the major problem today is this, that
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.900]   people have got too much money, and therefore there is this increase in sin and vice and
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.220]   crime.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:53.420]   The problem, they say today, is the problem of this society of ours, the plentiful society,
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.660]   the exact opposite of what they taught before.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.100]   Before they used to say also that the trouble was that men had to work so hard they were
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.660]   tired out and they didn't have time to think and to read, and if only we could give them
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:10.300]   more leisure, more time to think and to read, well, then they would lift themselves up and
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.940]   they'd get rid of sin and they wouldn't be the victims of evil.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.380]   Well, we've succeeded in doing that also, haven't we?
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:24.180]   And now we're being told that the great problem facing us is the problem of leisure, that
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.020]   people have got too much time on their hands and because they don't know what to do they
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.540]   go and do things they shouldn't do.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.180]   The problem of leisure, you see, it's always this, it's always that.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.020]   Man is trying to solve the problem.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   What's the matter?
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.220]   Why are people behaving as they're behaving?
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.660]   Why do we get these wars?
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.980]   Why is there this unhappiness?
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.180]   Why is there mounting crime and all the rest?
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180]   What is it?
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.180]   Well, now, they've been trying to deal with this throughout the running centuries.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.180]   Philosophy comes in.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:56.140]   That is the real business of philosophy, to try to understand men, to try to understand
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:02.500]   life, and we've had great philosophers in many centuries, but the problem still remains.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.140]   The philosophers can't get at it.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.280]   They themselves are suffering from leprosy.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.460]   They tell us what to do, they can't do it themselves.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.620]   Even if we do what they say, we're still not happy.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.140]   This problem remains.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:17.580]   Education, culture, come right up to today.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:24.900]   The world today is full of agencies designed and brought into being to solve this problem.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   We've never had so many.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.180]   The world has never been so busy in trying to treat itself as it is at this moment.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.020]   I mustn't wear you with these things, but you're aware of the agencies.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:41.220]   Marriage guidance council, psychology being introduced into the school, into the home,
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   into the prison, everywhere.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.380]   They say, "Now, we must get at it in this different way.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.200]   We're exploring every avenue.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.220]   We are searching in every direction."
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:56.100]   But the problem is not only there, it's becoming more and more evident and obvious.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.100]   What is all this?
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:04.340]   Well, all this, you see, is nothing but the old picture of Nerman the Syrian, who was
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.620]   a leper.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.820]   The physicians and astrologers couldn't heal him.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.660]   The kings couldn't heal him.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.620]   They'd all done their utmost, but here he is, and nothing can be done, and the position
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.900]   is desperate.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.620]   And that is the world as you and I, the world that you and I are in at this very moment.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.260]   The world is very sick.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.300]   The world is desperately ill.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   The leprosy is there.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.900]   It's staring at us in the face.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.540]   Look at all our acts of Parliament during the last hundred years.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.580]   We've never passed so many.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.900]   Man has never passed such good legislation as he's passed in the last hundred years.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.660]   I'm not here to criticize them.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.540]   That's no part of the business of preaching.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:54.700]   All I'm here to say is this, that all this noble, excellent, wonderful, beneficent legislation
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.780]   leaves the fundamental problem.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.180]   The leprosy remains.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.780]   Man is still sick.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.540]   Man is still miserable and unhappy.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.780]   Man is still failing.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.740]   Man is still ill at ease.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.820]   Man is still full of fear.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.100]   Man doesn't understand he's bewildered.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.180]   He feels he's the victim of forces round and about him, and he can't escape them.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.980]   This thing is in his constitution, and all that is being done for us doesn't seem to
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.940]   touch the problem.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.900]   The kings fail completely.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.140]   The problem is evidently too deep for them.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.380]   It's too subtle for them.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.860]   The disease is too foul for them.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.500]   Their medicaments are inadequate.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.100]   Very well, there is the second point that is put here so plainly to us, but let me hurry
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.700]   to the third.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:32:02.220]   And the third point is that man is ignorant of the only way to deal with the problem.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.220]   What do I mean?
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:09.700]   Well, this is to me the most entrancing and the most charming part of this story, and
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.620]   I want to show you the way in which it's put.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.860]   Here is this great man suffering from leprosy.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.180]   Everything has been tried, everything has failed, and they're beginning to feel utterly
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.220]   hopeless.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.900]   But now the remedy was to be had.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.900]   It was there.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.340]   There was a remedy available.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.580]   But these great people knew nothing at all about it.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.780]   They were completely ignorant of it.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.980]   The solution is there in Elisha the prophet, but these people know nothing about Elisha
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.100]   the prophet.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.460]   These great kings, looking for a solution, unaware of the presence of the solution, by
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:53.460]   them the whole time.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.340]   There is the picture of the world, isn't it?
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.740]   We wouldn't be in this building at this moment, and I wouldn't be standing in this pulpit
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.900]   if there were no solution.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.180]   That's what I'm doing here, that's what I'm for.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:13.980]   I'm here to announce a solution, an absolute solution, a certain cure.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.700]   But the world doesn't pay any attention to this, doesn't seem to be aware of it.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.060]   Is there not some other physician somewhere?
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.700]   Isn't there some great astrologer somewhere?
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.700]   Is there another king?
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.380]   That's what the world is thinking.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.060]   The world is unaware of the fact that the whole time the answer is at hand.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.140]   It doesn't know it, it's ignorant of it.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.140]   Why?
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:44.980]   Well, because the world, you see, is concerned about what it calls "great matters."
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.140]   The world is not interested in anything small.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.380]   Everything for the world must be on a big scale.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.100]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.300]   It does everything in a grand manner.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   Everything must be big.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   Why?
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.740]   Well, because man is so great, he's got such a great conceit of himself that nothing but
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.780]   some great solution is adequate, and he's always looking for that.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.020]   You see, great kings, here they are, two of them, they are concerned about great affairs
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.020]   of state.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.420]   They are concerned about great armies and about great conquests.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:24.340]   A little servant girl happens to have been captured in a little skirmish with Israel,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.700]   but a king knows nothing about a little servant girl.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   How can he?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   It's ridiculous nonsense.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:33.460]   What if a man went into the king and said, "Your Majesty, you know, in that last fight
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.340]   we captured a little servant male, maid.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.780]   Can't you imagine what would happen to him?
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.180]   He'd be thrown out of court, dismissed from his job probably."
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.300]   What's a servant maid to a king?
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.620]   The solution is there, but kings are concerned with great matters.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.660]   And the whole world is like that.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:35:01.180]   The world spends its time in setting up royal commissions, acts of Parliament, the profundities
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.900]   of some great philosopher, some wonderful discovery of science.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:11.820]   It's looking, scanning the heavens, something big, great, marvelous, outstanding, something
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.420]   absolutely new, something hitherto unheard of.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.620]   That's what the world is always looking for, isn't it?
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.700]   And it is because it is like that, you know, that it's unaware of the solution which is
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.300]   at hand.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:35.740]   Or to put it in another way, the world is unaware and ignorant of the only real solution,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:41.900]   because this solution is so essentially different from everything that it had ever imagined.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.020]   That's the thing that comes out in this story.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.020]   What is this?
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.980]   Well, let me put it to you positively.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.060]   You know, the whole of the biblical message, the whole of the Christian salvation and what
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.140]   it's got to tell us this evening is all in this little servant girl.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.780]   I like the way the Scripture puts it.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   Listen.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.780]   "The Syrians had gone out by companies."
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.740]   This is what you're told immediately after what you're told about this great, big, almost
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.100]   almighty man, Naaman the Syrian, who was a leper.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:16.060]   Then verse 2, "The Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:27.740]   of the land of Israel a little maid, and she waited on Naaman's wife."
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.380]   Nobody knew about her.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.200]   She was too unimportant.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   She doesn't matter.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   She doesn't count.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   How can she?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.620]   But here you see is the glory of this Gospel, the message of this book.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:43.860]   Here is its irony, its divine sarcasm, its extraordinary paradox.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.220]   The great are looking for great things.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.220]   Kings are going to cure.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   Send him to that king.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   Ask him to heal him.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.780]   "Who am I?" says the other king.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.420]   "Am I a god that I can do?"
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.780]   They're thinking in those terms.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:01.540]   But the solution and the answer is there in the little servant girl, the unknown maid
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.660]   who was attending on Naaman's wife.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.580]   The answer to the problem is there, not in the drawing room, but in the kitchen, as it
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.580]   were.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.980]   Not in the palace, in the courtroom, not amongst the courtiers and the sycophants.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.980]   Where is it?
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.100]   Well, I say, it's in the lowest and the humblest place in connection with the whole establishment.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   There's the answer.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:33.660]   Have you ever realized that that is what we are told in the Bible from beginning to end?
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.020]   That's the picture that is given.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.300]   That's the message that is given in the Bible.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:45.020]   Here, you see, are these great dynasties, these great empires, Egypt and Babylon and
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.860]   Assyria and the Chaldeans and this, that and the other.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.060]   They were great people.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.940]   They were great kings, great captains, great chieftains.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:58.020]   They had their great men, their astrologers, their magicians, their wise men.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.380]   These great empires striding the universe, as it were.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:08.060]   That's what secular history is interested in.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:14.140]   But you know, the real key to the history of the world is to be found in a very little
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.180]   country called Palestine.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:25.300]   Just a little bit of strip of land seems so small and insignificant by the side of these
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.340]   great spreading empires.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.260]   But it's the key to history.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.420]   That's the little country that figures in this book everywhere.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.740]   That's the little country that is always bringing in the solution, turning everything upside
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.780]   down, giving the answer that the great and the mighty are looking for, the despised little
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.740]   land of Palestine.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:53.140]   And likewise with the people, the Jews.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.180]   This is God's way, you see.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.460]   This is God's answer.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.580]   This is God's solution.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:05.900]   He chose the smallest nation of all, a nation that seemed to be quite despicable by the
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.980]   side of the others.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.180]   But here is the secret.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.780]   This little people, this little race in this little country, they are the people.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.580]   They are the people who have got the answer.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.660]   They were the ones who believed in the one and only true and living God, while the others
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:23.460]   believed in their polytheism, their many gods, their animism and various other things.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.100]   Here was the testimony.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:31.300]   The others ignored it, they laughed at it, but they had to come to it.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:39.380]   And there you find many wonderful stories which illustrate exactly the same point.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.980]   It's always some unexpected humble and lowly person who doesn't seem to count at all who's
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.980]   got the solution.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.660]   Let me give you one great parallel in passing.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.860]   You remember the story of Joseph?
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:40:01.900]   Here is a great man in Egypt, Pharaoh, endless wealth and power, no limit to his authority
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:09.380]   and to his success and everything that he can command.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:14.220]   But suddenly he is threatened with an awful and a devastating problem.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:21.100]   A famine is coming, and what can they do about it?
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.500]   He's had a dream and he doesn't understand it.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.420]   He sends for his wise men and astrologers.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.020]   They're dumbfounded, they're absolutely confounded, they don't know.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.580]   All the might and the understanding of Egypt is put to bear upon the problem.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.260]   Commission after commission is set up.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.540]   All the subtleties of science and of art and everything that can be produced, it's all
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.540]   on the problem.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.100]   None of them have an answer.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   Where does the answer come from?
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:54.220]   Comes from a prison, from a man who's a prisoner in a prison.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.220]   Who is he?
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.380]   Oh, he's some fellow that was sold to them by some traveling merchant, never been in
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.780]   the court, never known to the king, to Pharaoh.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.060]   From the prison, from a lowly person who doesn't matter, somebody they'd never heard of, he
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.060]   is given the dream, he gives his interpretation, he saves the position in Egypt.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.660]   Now that's the story of the whole Bible, you see.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.820]   You've got it equally well in the great case, in the great story of David and Goliath.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:28.260]   Here's a colossus striding the earth, and everybody's trembling and quaking in their
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.260]   shoes.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.100]   Who's the man who defeats him?
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:36.340]   Not a great captain in the army, but a little shepherd boy called David.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.140]   He can't even walk in the armor that's given him or handle the sword, but he can use a
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.780]   sling and one stone and it's quite enough.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.420]   That's the Bible, that's the message of the Bible.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.380]   The world is not aware of the answer, but the answer is there the whole time.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.820]   It's looking for great things.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.820]   God does it in this way.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.940]   Look at the story of the prophets, it's exactly the same.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:05.140]   But come for me to close, see it at its very acme.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:13.540]   In the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.140]   Where do you see it there, Sir Simon?
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.620]   Well, I'll tell you where I see it.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.860]   The whole world was looking for a Messiah in a sense.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:27.380]   They were scanning the heavens, but there was one place they never thought of looking.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.060]   And it was in that place that he came.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:39.780]   He was born in Bethlehem, one of the least and the most despised of the cities of Judah.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:45.820]   The Savior of the world wasn't born in Jerusalem, he was born in Bethlehem.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.700]   You read again the second chapter of Luke's Gospel and you'll read about that census,
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.180]   all the people went up to be taxed.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.460]   And they were all talking about the taxation and the politics and this ought to be put
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.460]   right and that ought to be put right.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.900]   They didn't know it, you know, but the Savior of the world was about to come into their
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   very midst.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.300]   They wouldn't go out of the hotel, they said there's no room, here's a woman about to have
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   a child.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:13.180]   No, no, we're not going to shift out, so she had to go and sleep in a stable.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.780]   And it was there that the Son of God was born and the Savior of the world.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.620]   The little servant made of the solution.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:30.420]   A little helpless babe lying in a manger is the answer.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.620]   With the cattle amongst the straw.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.980]   All the kings knew nothing about him, the great people knew nothing, the great thinkers
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.620]   knew nothing, the philosophers were unaware of it.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:45.620]   They were still seeking for something strange and new and wonderful.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.060]   But it was there he came.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.940]   Because the same principle, you see, the little maid, the unknown, the unexpected, there's
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.940]   the answer.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.260]   And where did this person spend his time after he came to manhood?
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   Well he spent his time up in Galilee.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.740]   And they were all stumbled and offended at this.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.220]   They said this man claims that he's a unique teacher.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.100]   If he is, why did he spend his time up there in Galilee?
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.460]   And who is he preaching to?
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.180]   He's preaching to a rabble of poor common people.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.940]   If he's the Son of God, why doesn't he go up to Jerusalem?
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.820]   Why doesn't he set himself up as a king?
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:23.140]   Why doesn't he gather a great army and conquer the enemy and dismiss us from the power of
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   Rome?
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.020]   Why doesn't he?
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:34.420]   This fellow, this carpenter, always up there in Galilee with this rabble of ordinary people.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.420]   Watch this.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:40.220]   He's not a philosopher, he's not a king, he's not a great man.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.780]   This impossible.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:52.540]   And then of course they saw him nailed to a tree and dying and expiring in apparent
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   utter weakness upon it.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:01.100]   And they see his body taken down and buried and put into a grave and they say, "Is that
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.100]   your Savior?
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.100]   Is that your salvation?"
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.100]   "No, no," they say.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.660]   "You don't get salvation out of kitchens and out of stables.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:18.900]   Something big, something great, something momentous, something marvelous."
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.860]   The world, you see, has never been aware of the solution to its problem, the answer to
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.580]   its every question, the only satisfaction of its every need.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.140]   And this was not only true of the Son of God himself, it's been true of the church ever
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.140]   since.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:38.300]   Look at the church as it was at the beginning, a handful of ordinary men.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.700]   There wasn't a great man amongst them, there wasn't an able man apparently, just ordinary
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.700]   men, workmen, fishermen.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:52.300]   He leaves his kingdom to them and the world is not aware of it.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.420]   But the world soon began to pay attention to them because they proceeded to turn the
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.040]   world upside down.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:05.020]   And within three centuries when the great Roman Empire was reeling under the attacks
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:11.140]   of the Goths and the Vandals and the barbarians and everything was being lost, it was the
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:18.820]   Christian church that preserved what was preserved of civilization and of truth.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.500]   The thing from the kitchen again, the people in the catacombs, not the people in the imperial
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.700]   palace, the catacombs, there was the vital thing.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.500]   The emperor didn't know it, they didn't realize it, but there was the solution hidden
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:37.340]   away in the bowels of the earth in the catacombs.
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.620]   And so it has continued throughout the running centuries.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:46.140]   The world in its madness and in its greatness has been seeking its solutions from some sort
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   of a king.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.820]   And the solution has been there, and when it's been desperate it's had to turn to
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.180]   it, as these people had to turn to the little servant girl.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:59.460]   I'm thinking of Martin Luther at the moment, just one man, just an ordinary monk, not a
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:05.180]   cardinal, a man who was insignificant apparently, in a place unknown, in a corner of Germany,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.780]   but there was God with the man and the answer came forth.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:14.900]   It's the great story of revivals.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:22.620]   And you know, my friends, the position is still the same this evening.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:30.300]   There is only one answer to the problems of society tonight, and it is the answer that
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:35.500]   the Christian church possesses.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:41.540]   But 90% of the people of this country are not interested in the Christian church.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.780]   We are told that only 10% affect any sort of interest and only half of those prosecute
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.660]   it at all actively.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.820]   Of course not, they're interested in great things.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.780]   What's Bertrand Russell got to say?
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.540]   What's this great thinker got to say?
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.260]   What acts of parliament can we pass?
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.260]   What new commissions can we set up?
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.140]   What can we apply to this matter?
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.340]   We must bring our scientific knowledge to bear, and we are going on with great confidence,
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.420]   sure we're going to find it.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.180]   You'll never find it.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:15.780]   There is only one solution to the problem of sin.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:23.880]   It is this Christian message of salvation, the despised, derided, forgotten Christian
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.880]   church.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.620]   Alone has the answer.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.860]   We are in the kitchen of life.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.420]   The newspapers know nothing about us.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.300]   The world has never heard of us.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.180]   What's it matter?
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   We are God's servant maid.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:51.860]   We are the unknown, the despised minority, the little remnant that remains.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.820]   But we've got an answer to the problem.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.180]   We've got a cure for the disease.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:02.500]   It is our testimony alone that stands between the world and destruction this evening.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   What is it?
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:10.300]   Well, it's the testimony that was given by the little servant maid to her mistress.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:18.620]   We don't say that we can cure the world, but we do know that the power of God can.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.220]   That's all this girl knew.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.980]   She couldn't cure leprosy, but she did know that there was a cure.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.940]   She'd come from a land where the power of God had been manifested, and she said, "You
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:37.380]   know, if my master could only get unto this power, then his leprosy would be healed."
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.140]   And that is what I'm doing in this pulpit this evening, and this is the task of the
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.780]   Christian church.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.620]   We are just bearing witness to this.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:56.140]   That when the world has come to realize that with man it is impossible, we go on to say,
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.140]   but not with God.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:05.060]   For with God all things are possible.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:13.140]   There is an almighty power, there is a miraculous power, there is power, power, wonder-working
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.820]   power in the precious blood of the Lamb.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:22.260]   There is a dynamic in this Christian message this evening that is able to eradicate sin,
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:29.820]   to cleanse men and purify them and restore their skin to its original condition.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:38.700]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ," says Paul, "why, it is the power of God."
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:43.980]   And to salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, I
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.540]   am here to tell you this evening that whatever your problem, whatever the running sore of
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.660]   your soul, whatever the thing that gets you down and damns and ruins your life, there
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.220]   is one cure.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.020]   It is an absolute cure.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.420]   It is the cure of God.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:06.420]   There is a power.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.780]   And the little girl was able to testify to the one through whom the power was exercised.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.860]   Do you remember how she put it?
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:20.940]   She said it like this, "Would God, my Lord, were with the prophet that is in Samaria?"
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.720]   There is power in Samaria and it is exercised through a prophet.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.500]   He pointed to a person.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:35.900]   And thank God that is my privilege in this pulpit at this moment.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:42.900]   I am not here merely to preach a vague, indefinite power.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:49.860]   I am here to point to a person, the one in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:57.340]   bodily, the one in whom God has treasured up all the riches and the resources of his
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.940]   grace and wisdom and power, Christ Jesus.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:12.620]   We preach Christ crucified, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:21.340]   And what I tell you this evening is that you have but one thing to do in the depth of your
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:31.820]   disease, in the agony of your need, with the running sore of your soul.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:41.660]   Go to Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, and you will be cured.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:47.420]   He can remove your guilt because he has already taken it away.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:53.100]   He can give you new life, new power.
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.740]   He will heal you.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.900]   He will restore you.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.340]   He will make you anew.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.020]   He will lead you on.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.020]   Go to him.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.020]   That is all you have to do.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.500]   He is the all-sufficient Savior.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:22.380]   He is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes him.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:26.540]   That is all.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:35.980]   What the world could not do, he does just like that.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.820]   You just go to him.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.220]   He knows all about you.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.780]   He can heal you.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   Heal your soul.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.500]   Heal your spirit.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:56.380]   Rid you of the thing that spoils life for you and give you life anew, life indeed, life
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:01.420]   more abundant.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:10.820]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God, but it has pleased God through the foolishness of
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:16.140]   preaching to save them that believe.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.780]   It is still the same tonight.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:25.940]   Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.260]   They are all scoffing at Christianity, dismissing it all.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:34.740]   Yes, but they are ill, they are lepers.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:41.820]   God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the things that are wise.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.300]   Servant maid, you see, knows what kings do not know.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.660]   God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound those that are wise.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.980]   Yes, things that are despised, things that are not.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:59.220]   People like ourselves, it is through us, it is our testimony, it is our witness, our life,
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:10.460]   it is an exact repetition and continuation of the little maid who was serving Naaman's
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:19.980]   wife, who had the answer when the great and the kings were still ignorant.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:25.700]   My dear friend, in the midst of all your reading and all your delving into the mysteries and
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:31.220]   all your thinking, wait for a moment.
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.500]   Listen to this old, old story.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:45.620]   Listen to this despised message of Jesus and his love, of Jesus and his blood, of Jesus
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:53.860]   of Nazareth, Son of God, dying that you might be healed, rising to give you life and to
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:56:01.740]   present you to God, go to him, and you will be healed.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.620]   Amen.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.540]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
