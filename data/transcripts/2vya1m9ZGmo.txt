[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Kayla writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, my soul is in great distress.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   After living in disobedience and under conviction for a few months,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   my deep desire I once had for fellowship with God is now gone.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I used to be so in love with Christ, and Hebrews 4 makes clear that
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   sin hardens the heart, and I found it to be true. My question is this,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   does this mean I have fallen away from the faith? My biggest fear is being
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   destined for destruction, as scripture says of Judas and others. Please help."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Kayla?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I'm really thankful that Kayla is in distress.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I'm thankful that she's fearful, because how much worse would it be
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   if Kayla were careless right now? If she were cavalier, if she were just
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   blowing off this coldness and saying, "Devil, my care, I don't give a rip
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   how I feel, doesn't matter anymore, I tried that Christianity stuff,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I'm done with it." That would be infinitely worse than fear and distress.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The text that gives her fear, but also gives hope, is Hebrews 12 about Esau?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   "See to it," this is chapter 12, verse 15 from Hebrews, "See to it that no one
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   fails to obtain the grace of God, that no one is sexually immoral or unholy
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   like Esau," and maybe that's what she's done, is fallen into a season of sexual
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   sin. I mean, those are the kinds of things that make us feel hopeless
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   about our possible salvation. "Don't be like Esau, who sold his birthright
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   for a single meal," just threw away his spiritual privileges for an immediate
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   gratification. "For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   a blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place," that's the literal translation,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "no place to repent, no occasion to repent, no repentance, though he sought it
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   with tears." It's possible to backslide so long and so deeply that there's no
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   return. Now, is that what's happened with you? It doesn't sound like it,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   because Esau was rejected not because he repented and wouldn't be accepted,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   but because he couldn't repent. That's what it says. He found no repentance.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   He found no place to repent, though he sought it with tears. He had become
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   so callous, so hard, so distant, that there was no ability for him to see
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   how horrible his sin is, to see how great the mercy is, to feel horrible and
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   broken about his sin and turn away from it to the living God. He couldn't do it.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It was all a sham as far as he was concerned. And the question then,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Kayla, is do you see the horror of sin? That's a gift of God. That's an element
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   of repentance. Do you see the gospel held out freely? So here's what Jesus said
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   about the unforgivable sin, because my guess is that's lurking right there in
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   the background of your concern, is have I committed the unforgivable sin?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Here's what Jesus says in Matthew 12, 31. And listen to these initial words,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   because they are meant to give you hope. "Therefore I tell you, every sin and
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   blasphemy will be forgiven, people." That's amazing! Every sin and blasphemy
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   will be forgiven. And then he says, "But the blasphemy against the Spirit will
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   not be forgiven." Now, what is that? They were calling him the devil. They were
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   saying that he casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, and therefore they
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   had turned the world on its head. They were seeing Jesus as demonic, and they
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   were no longer able to see Jesus as who he really was. Have you gotten to the
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   demonic point that Jesus is the devil, and you now can pronounce judgment on
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   him? Or can you repent? And if you can repent, there's hope. And here's one of
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   the most beautiful statements of hope that I know of. It's from 1 Timothy 115,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   where Paul is talking to you, Gaila. "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me as the foremost,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   to believe in him for eternal life." So here's what he's saying. I was a
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   blasphemer, a murderer. He says this in Acts 9. A murderer, a persecutor, a hater.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And let this sink in. Paul was a Pharisee. He believed in demons. There is no reason
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   to believe that Paul disagreed with the Pharisees in the Gospels who said Jesus
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   was casting out demons by the power of demons. Paul was a blasphemer. He had
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   walked right up to the edge, evidently, of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. And God
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   chose him, saved him. Why? Paul says it's so that in the 21st century, John Piper,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   on a podcast, could say to Gaila, "Christ is that patient with you." That's why he
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   saved Paul. He saved Paul for Gaila. I really believe Gaila should read 1
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Timothy 1 15 to 16 that way. Paul wants to be read as giving encouragement to
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   those who feel like the patience of God has run out. So in the name of Jesus and
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   with the authority of Paul, Gaila, I think I can say to you, I do say to you, turn
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and come to Jesus and you will find his arms outstretched to a prodigal daughter.
