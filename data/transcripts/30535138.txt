[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.220]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.920]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.240]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.600]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.380]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.760]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.960]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.000]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.560]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.960]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.080]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.840]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.360]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.240]   Well, friends and listeners,
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.960]   I'm excited to tell you that the end
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.560]   of the academic year is approaching.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440]   I know that some of you have been chomping at the bit
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   and some of you are sort of sad
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.920]   to see your community days drawing to a close,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.600]   but all of us are thinking about end of the year
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.240]   and end of the year stuff.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.000]   And one of the things that goes along
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   with bringing our academic year to a close
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.100]   is usually assessment.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.620]   Looking back at what we've done,
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.520]   at what our students have learned,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.240]   about how we've grown together,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.360]   and then also considering
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   what do we wish had happened differently.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.800]   All kinds of things to do with assessment.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.560]   So today we are gonna talk a little bit
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.440]   about assessing the year,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.080]   but I want us to think about assessment
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.460]   maybe in a little bit of a different way.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.800]   We wanna think of assessment
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   as celebrating the students that you have.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.600]   And with me today is a very dear friend,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   a CC director who's worked with CC for years and years.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.280]   I know her, I love her.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.380]   I know how she loves her family
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.520]   and how she loves on her community.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   And I happen to know that she's kind of a big celebrator.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   I have with me today, Jill Philbrick from North Carolina.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.240]   Jill, thanks for coming on.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.320]   - It is such a pleasure to be here with you.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.160]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.560]   - Jill and I have had lots of opportunities
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.960]   at practicums and at trainings to celebrate together.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.040]   So I know listeners that you're gonna receive a blessing
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.960]   from hearing from her today.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.840]   So let me just put it out there, Jill.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.520]   I've already kind of spilled the beans with our audience.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.760]   Are you a big celebrator?
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.680]   - I am a big celebrator.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.960]   - Have you always been that way?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.520]   - Well, I think that in many ways, yes.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.200]   I would say that I have been.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.400]   - So as a child,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.580]   did your family do lots of celebrating things?
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.420]   - We did.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.320]   We did them.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.780]   I would say that I celebrate constantly maybe.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   That's really the way I feel like my parents were with me.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   My mom was home with me and we had one car.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.200]   So we spent a lot of time at home together
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.160]   just celebrating whatever.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.360]   I remember if I was learning to pronounce something
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.880]   or I was not homeschooled,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   but I have very vivid memories of my mom reading with me
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.760]   and helping me with vocabulary
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.280]   or if I had a school question
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840]   or one time they had a math thing at school
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.360]   and they called her and said
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.040]   that I had won this estimating contest thing.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   When I got home,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.520]   she had made a poster and hung it on the wall.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.120]   So I think I did grow up with that,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.760]   that celebration in everything.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.680]   Not only, I didn't have to do something giant.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.160]   If I was happy about it, she was happy about it.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   If I brought her a flower,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.400]   she was, "Oh, yay, thank you."
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.160]   So I think, yes, that was my culture.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.080]   - I love, that is very lovely.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.760]   What a lovely way to grow up,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   celebrating big things like birthdays
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   and winning prizes and then small things as well.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.480]   I can remember feeling celebrated
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.640]   when I learned to tie my shoe, you know,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.240]   or if I memorized a Bible verse
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.360]   for children's choir or something,
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.440]   I remember feeling celebrated.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   So what kinds of things do you celebrate as a family now?
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.200]   - As a family now, we definitely do birthdays,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.280]   you know, and different accomplishments.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   If someone met something like a work thing
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.040]   or a school thing, some things like that,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.760]   we definitely take a minute and everybody,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.600]   "Oh, look, guess what?
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.680]   "Tell everybody what you did today."
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.520]   If something happened at CC,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.840]   if there was a presentation that went well,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.120]   we tend to ask each other,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.680]   "Hey, how did your presentation go?"
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.880]   And even our older daughters would ask our sons,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.160]   you know, "Hey, how'd that thing go at CC today?"
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.600]   - Oh, that's so sweet.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.640]   - It really is.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.440]   And I guess that sort of celebration,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.600]   I wouldn't say it always turns into posters
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   and going out for dinner,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.200]   but it's always recognized
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.640]   and just affirming between one another.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.800]   So those kinds of things happen,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.920]   job things, good news that comes from different people.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.560]   At church, we celebrate, you know,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.480]   when there's a good report,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.240]   especially when we're praying for something to happen.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.160]   - Right, right.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.320]   - So yeah, that's all that's there.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.000]   - I love celebrating small things.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   I know, I feel like I like to celebrate things.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.080]   In fact, one of my daughter's friends said one time,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.640]   "Y'all have more weird celebration traditions
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.320]   "than any family I know."
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.040]   And so I think that maybe we do,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.640]   and I just didn't recognize that,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.040]   but we have always celebrated small things,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.280]   maybe in outsized ways.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.960]   I can remember for years,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   we celebrated the sighting of the first spring robin
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.760]   because Stephanie and I went to the library
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.960]   when she was really little and got books every week.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.800]   And one of her favorite books one year
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.280]   was a book called "My Spring Robin."
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.680]   And so it talked all about the first robin
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.440]   that this little child saw.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.360]   And so she made it her practice for years
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.320]   to find the first spring robin.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.600]   And I found myself last week,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   when I was able to spend some time
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.880]   with my grandson in his backyard,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.800]   I found myself looking,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.520]   and we in fact saw our first spring robin.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.640]   And I think he thought that Lolly
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.320]   was a little outside the bounds of it.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.960]   He didn't understand why I was so excited.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.040]   And I guess to him and his 20-month-old self,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.320]   it was just a bird in the backyard, Lolly.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   But I think that celebrating is fun.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.480]   - It is. - It's fun.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.000]   - And why wouldn't we?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.520]   - Yes. - I mean, you know,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.040]   God celebrates, He sings over us with joy.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.720]   There's glory every morning.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.160]   And I think He loves when we notice it.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.000]   I think He loves when we love one another enough
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.120]   to rejoice when others rejoice.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960]   - Yes.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.480]   I was gonna ask you, why is celebrating fun?
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.120]   'Cause we've talked about some fun things.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.640]   Why is celebrating fun?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   Why is celebrating necessary and beneficial or biblical?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.040]   I love what you've already said that, you know,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.680]   we're following God's example.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.240]   He celebrates and sings, and He asks us to be joyful.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.080]   Give me some other,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.800]   why is celebrating fun or necessary or biblical?
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   - Well, it's, I mean, it's really hard to celebrate
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.320]   with a frown on your face.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.880]   It's, you know, one time I heard somebody one time say
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.840]   that if you're not feeling happy, you should skip.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.600]   Because it is really hard to be in a bad mood
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.280]   while you're skipping.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.880]   - I don't think she invented that.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   I think she heard it somewhere.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   But I tried it, and it is true.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.360]   So I think putting ourself,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.480]   being intentional about rejoicing with others,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.960]   it might, if you're not a rejoicer or a celebrator,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.520]   it can feel a little uncomfortable at first and awkward.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.920]   You know, like maybe that person who really liked to hug
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.680]   and they come with their arms a little stiff.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.320]   But I think if we practice it,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.520]   we can begin to find a style of celebrating
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.360]   that works for us.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.960]   It doesn't have to everybody look the same,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.360]   but it does put our heart in an expectant state
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.640]   for good and for joy, and that's God, right?
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.160]   He is, He wants us to think on these things,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.080]   things which are worthy of praise,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.680]   things which glorify Him,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.480]   things which are good and have a good report.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.720]   And so we're doing what Philippians says
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   when we are looking for and thinking on those things.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.040]   So it is joyful and fun.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.720]   It is biblical.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.800]   And I think it's necessary because if we don't,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.480]   if we don't celebrate,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   then all the work can feel that it wasn't received.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.840]   And I think receiving the work
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.760]   is just as important as doing the work.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   So years ago, I was visiting family
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.960]   who lives a thousand miles away,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.120]   and I call her my cousin-in-law.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.480]   And if you've talked to me for long,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.400]   you've probably heard me talk about my cousin-in-law.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.080]   Michelle is her name, and she is so dear to my heart.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.840]   So she brought me, well, didn't bring to me,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.440]   she was showing me a quilt that somebody made
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   for her daughter.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.480]   So the thing's 20 years old now,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.520]   and it is shown some wear, but you can see the stitches.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.400]   And this quilt was, it's so precious to her.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.080]   And we were talking about how all that hard work,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.000]   those even stitches, that was, it was not,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.680]   it didn't just fall together.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.560]   This was hours of someone's time and love.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.360]   And if Michelle had not received that quilt,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.040]   it would have been just merely work
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.080]   on the part of her friend.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.360]   But when she received that quilt,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.480]   it was a joy for both of them.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.840]   And I think that when we receive the work
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.440]   that our children do, it's not anymore just work.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.480]   It's also joy.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.760]   If we cook a meal and everybody ate it,
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.320]   but no one received it with gladness,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.440]   then we just feel like we did work.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.080]   But if they tell us it was good, or that they appreciate it,
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   or they even notice that we, I don't know, did something,
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.560]   whatever thing we did different that time,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.080]   either added some cinnamon,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.080]   or put one little single flower on the table,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.120]   or maybe brought in that new spring robin
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.720]   and let it walk around on the table.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.160]   (both laughing)
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.880]   That when we notice those things, it does bring joy.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.320]   And if we don't notice, like God notices,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.160]   we read in the Bible that He sees the work we do,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.200]   and He honors it.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.240]   And sometimes knowing that He sees is enough for us,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.720]   because we can feel unthanked, we can feel unnoticed.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.920]   And I'm sure our children feel that way too,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.800]   about their math, and their science, and their Latin,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.120]   and cleaning their room, and practicing their instruments.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.960]   - Right.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.200]   - All those things that they can feel overlooked
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.160]   and unappreciated.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.840]   And when we know God sees it and God receives it,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.000]   then it helps us to do it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.160]   Well, why not us also actively follow God's pattern
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.080]   of receiving it, acknowledging it,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.280]   and making it part of what we celebrate?
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.680]   - Oh, I love this so much.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.160]   We celebrate because it follows God's pattern.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.680]   I love that.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   And what a great thing to pass on to our children
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.600]   so that our grandchildren will also be celebrated,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.120]   and our great-grandchildren.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.200]   I love it that in what you have said, Jill,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.720]   I can see that rejoicing together,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.640]   celebrating together, builds community.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.680]   And we can live together in celebration,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.000]   and that is a beautiful thing.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.040]   I love this a lot.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.200]   Okay, let me ask you,
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.320]   let's bring it toward our homeschooling lives.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.920]   I mean, although as homeschooling moms,
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.040]   for all of these years,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.880]   you and I are used to everything
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.040]   being about the homeschooling life.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.520]   What do you remember?
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.320]   'Cause you said you were not homeschooled.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.800]   Neither was I.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.000]   What do you remember about the end of the year
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.400]   as a student yourself?
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.040]   What was the end of the year like for you?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   I mean, I remember exams.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.400]   That's what I remember about the end of the year.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.600]   - Yes, I remember exams.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.960]   And I remember feeling that at the end of the year,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.480]   there was lots of watching movies.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.320]   - Oh, gosh, yes.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.280]   - In the classrooms.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.440]   You know, it felt like everything sort of slacked off.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.680]   But I don't know that I felt like
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.520]   there was an academic closure.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   And so I love that in CC,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.680]   we do have some year-end presentations,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.440]   some things that build.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.520]   I think that that final debate
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.280]   and that final presentation or speech
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.360]   or memory master opportunity,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.800]   even if you don't take advantage of it,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.560]   or faces of history,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.800]   I think that those things are an academic closure
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.200]   and a way to celebrate and finish something
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.040]   instead of just having it dribble off into nothingness.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   So I would say that my academic year,
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.160]   really, it just was a shift in our thinking
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   towards summer and most people,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.480]   I can't wait to get out of here sort of thing.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.960]   And sometimes the teachers too,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   which doesn't make you feel super celebrated
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.000]   and welcomed at all,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.120]   when the teachers don't know what to do.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.520]   - Yeah, they're just eager to get rid of you
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.720]   and not see you every day for a while.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.680]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.120]   And say, instead of,
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.920]   I don't think they knew,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.840]   they probably had work they had to do.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.880]   And so putting a movie on was,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.040]   it was not that they didn't want
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.120]   to do something fun with us
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.760]   and they thought they were doing something fun with us.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.920]   There were no blue books,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.320]   there was no big conversation at the end of the year
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.840]   with all the inside jokes that we have gathered
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   as we studied.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.560]   - I like that, inside jokes.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   Yeah, those last days of community with CC are,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.040]   you're right, all about the inside jokes
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.320]   and the remembering the stories
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.000]   and the culmination of all those efforts
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.680]   towards something.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.600]   Like you said, you have mock trial,
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.960]   you have the senior thesis,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.640]   you have final debates.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   So many end of the year,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.160]   tie up all the loose ends
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.920]   and let's celebrate together
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.240]   what we've learned together.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.640]   And that's a cool thing.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.960]   So what do you do with your children?
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.080]   What have you done?
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.120]   What do you do with your children
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.320]   as the end of the school year approaches?
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.160]   How do you commemorate the year?
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.320]   And then I'm gonna ask you,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.120]   how did you assess the year?
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.320]   - So I would say that commemorations in our home
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.000]   have followed what was being commemorated in community.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.800]   So if it was mock trial,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.640]   we would participate in that,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.240]   gear up for that and then celebrate that when it was over.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.840]   Or the final debate,
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.120]   just saying, "Hey, how did that go?"
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.880]   "Yay, your last debate, okay."
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.720]   - Wonderful.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.200]   Or you can either put it behind you
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   and let's just move on or--
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.280]   - Right. - Right.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.360]   (laughing)
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.200]   - Yes.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.800]   - You know, that can be the thrill of victory
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.640]   and the agony of defeat sometimes.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.280]   - Yes, the how well you did and how much we learned.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.120]   Yes.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.480]   - Yes, exactly, exactly.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.720]   And sometimes, okay, the Bible says let's avoid offense.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.480]   There can be some of that in there too.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.320]   - Right, right.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.280]   - Because it's difficult to look back
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.000]   without only seeing something from your own perspective
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.840]   in mock-- - Sure.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.640]   - Anything of the competition especially.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.800]   - Sure, sure.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.960]   - So, you know, working through that,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   I think that's part of assessing too is,
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.600]   okay, let's be honest about this.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   Where did you do well?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   Where didn't you do well?
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.200]   What was or was not what you would consider fair?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.320]   And what do we do about it in the future?
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.760]   Can you be more clear?
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.440]   Can you, what can you do?
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.720]   So those kinds of things I think have been,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.440]   have guided the kinds of celebrations we have at home
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.880]   based on the things that were accomplished in CC.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.480]   Excuse me.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.360]   So we would sometimes go out to dinner.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.280]   Sometimes maybe with another student or a family,
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.040]   people would say, hey, this is over, let's, who's,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.920]   and it would be spur of the moment usually.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.880]   Like, we're going to Chick-fil-A, you know,
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.720]   after commuting. - Yes.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.680]   - Of course it's Chick-fil-A.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.520]   - Of course. - Because that's where
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.360]   all the (indistinct) works.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   - That's where we're going.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.720]   - And get a milkshake.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.920]   - Yes.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.040]   - Right, things like that, or just even,
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.600]   just staying a little longer
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.480]   and playing on the playground a little longer.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.680]   And the moms hanging out and talking.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.960]   Our community doesn't have a whole lot of dads.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.680]   Usually if they come, they come for lunch or something,
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.200]   which we love seeing them.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.320]   But when I say moms, I only mean that
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.480]   in my personal community,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   there aren't really a lot of dads that are there.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.160]   Not that they shouldn't. - Yes.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.520]   - So I don't want to exclude that.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.520]   - But when the parents do hang around and talk and laugh,
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.320]   that feels like a celebration too.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   - Yes, it does. - That nobody's rushing
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.840]   to get in their car and that we ask each other,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.920]   hey, how'd they do?
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.240]   How did this go?
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.200]   I feel like that is, it's a way of life
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.920]   instead of maybe necessarily a huge thing.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.320]   And that because CC has a lot to celebrate throughout,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.120]   because we have peer review
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.040]   and self-assessment constantly in the challenge years,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.400]   we are frequently assessing
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   and learning how our assessment
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.160]   is not only what we would criticize about ourselves.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.280]   - Yes, yes, I like that.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   I remember that I used to,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   as a tutor, when we would have debates,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.960]   we would begin, we would always do assessment at the end
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.600]   because for one thing,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.960]   students have to be pressed to assess themselves well,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.800]   to not, some to not be too hard on themselves
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.440]   and some not to give themselves too much credit.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.000]   But it was always important that we did that together.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.560]   And so I would always ask the opposing team,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.760]   what did your opponent do well?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.440]   And they got to share what the other team did
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.680]   that was so good and they would give them kudos.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.000]   And then I would always ask each team,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.920]   what do you wish you had done differently?
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   Not necessarily better, that's kind of pejorative.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.880]   What do you wish you had done differently?
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.600]   So I love that whole idea of taking assessment,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   not just from your parent and not just from yourself,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.560]   but from your community of learning.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.800]   That's really good.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.720]   - Yes, and I love that you said too,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.920]   it's different instead of better.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.920]   I'm not sure that I have been intentional with that wording,
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.480]   but I love that.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.520]   And I love very specific, very intentional wording.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.280]   So I'm going to make that change
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.600]   and work toward adjusting that in my vocabulary.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.000]   I really like that.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.480]   What could you have done differently?
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.600]   - As a student, I was always, and frankly, as an adult,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.320]   I was always really hard on myself.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.760]   What did I do wrong?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.520]   How did I fall short?
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   And so I think it is really helpful to think,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.440]   huh, well, this is what I did and this was the outcome.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   Instead of saying, what did I do right or wrong?
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.920]   What could I do differently?
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.360]   Maybe the outcome was not bad,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   but I now think if I had done this instead,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.480]   maybe the outcome would have been this instead.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.920]   And so that's just, that's kind of fun.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.800]   - I really like that.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.360]   I think all the future people who cross my path
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.680]   and are assessed by me will want to write you
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.520]   a thank you note.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.920]   - Let me ask you this.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.520]   What do you assess about your student
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.240]   or with your student at the end of the year
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.000]   or anytime you do assessment really,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.960]   but since we're talking about assessments
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.360]   at the end of the year,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.200]   what do you assess with your students?
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.600]   - I would say the number one thing I assess is whether,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.480]   and I ask them, did you do your best?
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   I am thrilled when their academic work is strengthened,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.880]   but I would rather, and I don't think we have to choose.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.360]   I don't think it's either academic growth
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.440]   or character growth.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   But I think only one and not the other can be frustrating.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.640]   So if my child did great academic growth,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.280]   but grew very prideful or angry at their peers
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   or started comparing themselves a little haughtily
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.920]   or gave me a hard time every time I said, get out this,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.600]   then that's a big part of homeschool for me.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.320]   That's the whole point of homeschool
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.640]   is a whole person mentoring,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.800]   not just can you be the best at one
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.000]   or even six strands of learning.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.400]   So that is probably the heavier weight for me.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.960]   I have been blessed that my children
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.360]   have not struggled academically.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.040]   It does not mean that everything came easy.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.240]   I mean, that they were A students in everything,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.360]   but it does mean that I did not,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   they were able to do work when they applied diligence
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.680]   and when they tried, it was not the struggle
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.880]   that some people have to go through.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.680]   And I am very, very blessed for that.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   So I have had the ability to push them a little further
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.120]   and to push them in their attitude as well and say, okay,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.560]   but did you really do your best?
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.880]   And I think that I've assigned grades that way.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.480]   I have, I've said, okay, did you do your best?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.360]   And if they say no, then for me personally,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.600]   then that's not an A plus
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.360]   because in my assessment of my children,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.640]   their attitude matters toward their grade.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.320]   And if they did not give their best,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.680]   and if they did not give their best,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.600]   if they got everything right in math,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   but their attitude stunk,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.920]   well, I mean, it's kind of hard not to give an A plus
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.040]   when you got it all right,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.280]   but I am not very good at grading.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.960]   - You could, and you are the parent.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.080]   You are the authority.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.400]   You know what you were going for
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.960]   and arrogance was not it.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.800]   - No, it was not.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.600]   And honestly, I feel like grades mean so little
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.700]   compared to what they used to be,
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.200]   that everything is a gray area with grades,
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.720]   especially when you're a homeschooler,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.200]   that no college really looks at that A as an A,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.360]   that they don't look at that B as a B.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.800]   And I've given my kids Bs for not doing their best.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   And I've asked them, what do you think you deserve?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.560]   And they have said, well, I think I deserve a B here.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.840]   Now I have not, if they've said it was awful and hard
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.680]   and I think I deserve a C,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.400]   I'm like, well, okay, let's talk about it.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.080]   - Right, exactly.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.120]   - Did you put in the effort?
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.960]   - Yeah.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.640]   - Did you make, did you correct it?
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.360]   Yes, I worked through it and I corrected it.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.680]   Well, then it was right by the end.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.380]   So I'm not gonna make you carry poor work with you.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.040]   It's not like you got half of it right
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.020]   and you can't redeem it
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.660]   and now you move on to the next chapter
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.280]   and you still don't know what you're doing.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   We worked through it.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   We figured it out.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.740]   You did complete the assignment.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.240]   You did learn what you needed to learn
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.320]   and carry that with you into the next page
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.900]   or chapter or book.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.120]   So I think that I give a lot of grace there,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.560]   especially when there's been a good attitude.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.320]   So I would say we assess attitude.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.800]   We assess cooperation.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.720]   We assess even things like preparation.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.280]   Were you up on time?
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.160]   Did this year go well?
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.840]   And we've had years that I felt like the whole year
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.600]   was just a struggle with everybody getting on the same page
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.440]   at the same time.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.840]   And we've said, okay, guys, you know what?
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.880]   This year, what went well was X, Y, Z.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.240]   What did not go well was one, two, three.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.360]   So what's our plan?
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.840]   And we've tried to work together
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.460]   and come to an agreement.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.800]   I only have one child in CC anymore
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   and he is in challenge two.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   And so this year, from last year
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.680]   and the beginning of this year,
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.040]   we talked about, okay, what's our plan?
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.480]   We know that the two of us who are very much alike
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   and who are probably the most unstructured of us.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.920]   - Sure, I can see that.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.240]   (both laughing)
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.060]   I can see that.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.760]   - It's just like a great big comedy show for heaven.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.100]   And they can just watch them.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.600]   They're having a good time.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.280]   And so we had to say, okay, we've got to set our alarm.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.080]   We've got to meet in the kitchen by a certain time.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.960]   We've, and even he would come to me and say,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.840]   mom, you know what?
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.000]   I've noticed if we don't start with math,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.480]   then it's really hard to get it in.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.840]   I'm like, you're right, bud.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.120]   Let's get this thing going.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.440]   So I think the two of us,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   sort of a continual course correction, I guess.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.520]   - I feel like that was a very long answer.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.560]   - I think that's a good answer though.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.560]   I love that continual course correction is very important.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.640]   And you know what, Jill?
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.600]   I think that's a good piece for families
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   to add into assessment.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   So it's not just what did we do well this year academically
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   and how did we grow spiritually
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.040]   and emotionally and relationally?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.940]   It's also what will we do with this assessment?
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.040]   You're teaching your children
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.840]   that assessment is important, but for a reason,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.160]   not just so that we can feel better or worse about ourselves
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.720]   but for what you just said,
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.920]   it will allow for continual course correction.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.520]   If we know that what we did this year
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.080]   did not, either did or did not give us the results
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.640]   that we really were shooting for,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.880]   then what will we do to make sure
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.240]   we don't find ourselves discouraged or disappointed
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.760]   at the end of next semester?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   - Yes.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.560]   - So I love that.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.120]   - I really liked that you said
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   it isn't to make us feel good or bad.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.820]   It's to have a better result
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.460]   or a continued growth of results if things are going well.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.960]   I really liked that summary there.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.920]   That's awesome.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.560]   I know that a lot of parents,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.960]   especially maybe some of our listeners
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.820]   who are just getting started
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.880]   with this home-centered education,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.840]   they maybe have had their kids in public
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.080]   or even private school,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.040]   and they themselves may be the result
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.840]   of public and private education.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.640]   A lot of parents rely on assessing by test scores
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.680]   or a grade that their student may have gotten
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.560]   on a project, a report, or a paper,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.400]   mostly seeing assessment as how much have we learned
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.960]   this year in or about fill-in-the-blank subject.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.040]   But I love that you brought out
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.840]   there are other areas of growth
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   that we as parents who love our whole child want to assess.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.760]   You know, when I was in school,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.560]   I got a grade for trig
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.520]   and a grade for chemistry
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.720]   and a grade for American literature
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.160]   by specific teachers who,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.960]   now, I'm not saying they didn't care about me as a person,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.840]   but academically, they only cared about
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.200]   what I did in that one subject, in that one class.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.160]   And as homeschooling parents,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.560]   that's not true of our children's teachers
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.760]   'cause we care that they are learning
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.040]   what they are applying themselves to.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.560]   I'm not saying that I didn't care about
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   my child learning algebra two or biology, right?
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.600]   I did care that they were learning
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.880]   what they applied themselves to.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.320]   But I also cared that they were
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.680]   learning to do hard things,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.320]   that they were learning to persevere.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.960]   I cared that they were learning to listen
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.800]   with a caring heart.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   I wanted to know that they were kinder
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.840]   in their dealings with their family and their friends
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.640]   than they were last year.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.280]   So what are some other growth things that we could assess?
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.400]   - I think comprehension, and it sounds academic,
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   but if they are frustrated by Latin or math or reading,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.480]   then that would let us know that that's an area
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.040]   that they need more equipping.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.000]   And it isn't that they failed,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.080]   it might be that there's a missing piece,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.040]   a gap in the grammar somewhere,
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.480]   that somewhere, something is just not clicking.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.640]   And what we might say then is,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.240]   if we recognize that our student
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.920]   is having a hard time with something,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.800]   then that's probably the area
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.640]   that we need to begin sitting with them while they work.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.480]   - Good job.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.840]   Oh yeah, that's awesome.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.200]   - That way we are also,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.600]   I mean, 'cause we probably don't know
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.120]   as much as they do about the topic
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.800]   if we haven't been sitting with them.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.720]   So letting them teach us or letting them ask questions
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.600]   and us working through some of those things and using,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.200]   there's so many resources.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.440]   Oh my goodness.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.520]   I mean, CC Connected,
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.680]   if you really are a watch a video person,
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.960]   there's videos for most of the things.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.240]   - For most everything.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.080]   - Yes.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.160]   And in foundations,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.320]   lots of people have come up with lots of things.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.600]   If memory work has been hard,
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.200]   then we need to sit with our children
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   and work on memory work.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.200]   If Faces of History or leading up to that
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.720]   with writing and IEW has been hard,
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.680]   then maybe we need to let them dictate to us
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.760]   or we need to model that for them.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.280]   Maybe we need to diagram some sentences
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.920]   and let them ask us the questions to confirm,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.960]   are we in the right direction here with this?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.600]   What part of speech is this?
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.800]   The question confirmations that they learn.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.960]   Maybe if we're in challenge A
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.840]   and they're having a hard time with their Latin vocabulary,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.640]   we need to sit down beside them and say,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   okay, tell me everything you know about this ending
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.440]   and let's compare it to the answer key
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.200]   and what can you find?
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.720]   So it's more, I would say,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.680]   assessing if they're comfortable learning.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.840]   And if they're not,
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   then we have a part as a parent
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.120]   to equip them in that area and strengthen that.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.040]   It isn't necessarily, can be,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.680]   that they just didn't do their work.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.360]   But then that's not a learning thing.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.200]   That's really something else.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.600]   - That's a hard thing.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.440]   - It is.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.680]   So if they need assessment in that area,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.560]   I would say, so understanding
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.960]   is something that's good to assess
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.160]   and to assess whether we're doing it
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.760]   in a way that helps them understand,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   not to assess their ability to understand,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.360]   but is this process working?
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.280]   Like we did in IEW,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.200]   did your keyword outline serve you well?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.440]   If you couldn't remember it,
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.360]   it wasn't that there's something wrong with your memory,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.400]   it's that you need to tweak your keyword outline
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.520]   'cause those things that you wrote
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.080]   aren't triggering your memory,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.760]   aren't allowing you to,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.240]   you need to choose something different.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.680]   - Right, right.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.040]   - So did it serve you, not did you serve it?
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.600]   And so I think the same thing with comprehension.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.080]   I would say too, assessing in an area of what,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.200]   like you said earlier, are they kinder?
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.080]   Are they celebrating one another?
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.920]   And when they feel celebrated,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.320]   hopefully that's some seed we planted in them
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   that will grow and will produce celebration for others.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.760]   Hopefully they will start to look at their friends
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.320]   and say, "Hey, that was a great, I loved your presentation.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.520]   "This was so good."
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.880]   And maybe even recognize where,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.120]   if we talk through those things with them
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.840]   about this is what you did well,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.960]   then maybe they'll be more comfortable
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.920]   sharing those kinds of compliments with others.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.840]   Or if we say, so language,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.200]   if a student says, "I'm a math person,"
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.880]   which I don't like when people do that anyway
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.200]   because you're a person and God is all those things
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.480]   and he's all those things in you.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.360]   So just don't limit yourself.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.280]   I'm not saying that you can't love math.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.840]   I'm saying don't say that that's all you are
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.880]   because you have all of it
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.120]   'cause God has all of it and he's in you.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.080]   But if you love math and feel like that literature is hard,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.200]   then maybe you can look at literature like you look at math
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.640]   and learn to decode literature.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.320]   Or maybe if you feel like you're really strong in literature
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.520]   and that math is not your favorite thing
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.960]   or that math seems to be more work for you,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.360]   then look at math as a language.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.920]   So what are your strengths?
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.360]   What makes this one thing work for you?
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.280]   And then ask the Lord.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.480]   Like as a parent, we can say,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   "Lord," he's right there wanting us to ask him,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.680]   "What this more approachable for my child?
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.440]   "Why do they seem to have better success,"
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.520]   on paper at least, "in this area?
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.760]   "And how can I relate that to this other area?"
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.440]   And show them where the skills they have
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.320]   will also work here.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   And that can encourage our students
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.440]   so they don't feel they have to put a whole different brain
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.760]   in their head to do a different task.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.040]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.080]   Wow, and that really teaches them
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.680]   about assessment in a different way.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.640]   It is not just a grade.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.640]   It is not only outcome-based.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   It's let's look at the process.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.240]   Let's look at the process of learning
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   and let's focus together as a parent and student as a team
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:21.080]   on how can we help you shore up your grasp
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.760]   on the skills of learning and on the different tools.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.000]   And let's look at the outcome that you got
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.960]   and why that might be a surprise to you.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.560]   And there's so much more to assessing
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.440]   than just thinking you got an A and you got a B
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.760]   and you got these many things right on the test
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.680]   and this many things wrong on the test.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.440]   It goes beyond that.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.800]   And as parents, we are so blessed as homeschooling parents
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.160]   that we have the time and the interest
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.200]   and the intimate knowledge of our student
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.520]   and how they are working.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.720]   And we really can do a better job of assessment
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   than any other entity can possibly do with our student.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.880]   And I love it that as the homeschooling parent,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.520]   as the mom and the dad in this situation,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   you know and love and shepherd your child's heart
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.200]   like nobody else besides the Father God.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.840]   And so you care about are they growing
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.880]   in the fruits of the Spirit?
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.160]   You know, have they learned
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.520]   to love their neighbor better this year?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   Are they learning to speak the truth in love?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.000]   Are they, like you said,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.520]   are they learning the art of encouraging one another?
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   You know, can you see if your child is more confident
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.960]   in following the Lord's guidance?
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.600]   You know, these are all, I mean, think about,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.680]   here's the truth, friends, classical educators, all of us.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.880]   Here's the truth.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.640]   When your child is 35,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.360]   probably nobody's gonna ask them
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.440]   to diagram a Latin sentence.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.320]   Nobody will care if they can do it or not,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.840]   but they may very well care
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   if your child speaks words of gold,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   if they speak kindness and love and truth,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.680]   if they can recognize and share beauty.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.880]   And so these are things,
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.240]   if these are the things that are important to us,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.760]   we need to spend some time assessing those things
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.680]   as well as test scores.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.280]   - Yes, and with test scores,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.920]   that does not assess character.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.160]   It does not assess their confidence,
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.840]   and it can feel so clinical.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   And we don't.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.520]   So for year-end, you know,
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.120]   the standardized tests that are required,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.960]   I did not necessarily teach that material.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.360]   My children did not necessarily read the same material
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.280]   that they would have read for a system
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.240]   that is planning on that particular test.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   And so I have, I think that maybe,
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.960]   I think there's a lot of us this way
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.680]   who really don't care about the test scores,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.160]   the standardized test scores.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.120]   We do it to check a box for the state
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   and to be honorable to what is required, and that's fine.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.240]   And I am comfortable with that because I don't care.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.000]   I really, personally, I don't care.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.040]   If it was really, really low,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.320]   I would probably then say,
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.280]   "Okay, we probably need to do a little more reading
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.240]   or a little more time here."
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.880]   But I don't even, I don't care.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.400]   If it's not dangerously low,
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.360]   and if it's really, really high,
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   then I also am thinking,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.280]   "Well, that probably has to do with the fact
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.160]   that you've had a well-rounded education
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.120]   and good reasoning skills."
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.440]   And some people just take tests well.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.280]   Some people are fantastic at standardized tests,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   and some people aren't.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.000]   It does not always reflect
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.640]   what we actually are thinking process.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.600]   I have sat there- - Such a good reminder.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.080]   - Well, I've sat there watching my children
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.960]   taking an online test, and I've seen them get things wrong.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.000]   And I've known that it was the way the question was worded.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.240]   Specifically, one of my children,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.200]   and you know my children,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   you could probably- - Yep, yep.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.000]   - Switch one like this,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.240]   watched this math question.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   She was probably in sixth or seventh grade.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.720]   And it said, "Tom has seven helpers,
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.840]   and they all, this many acres of wheat, this many dollars."
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.960]   This, I mean, it was a long, lots of things.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.640]   - Yes, lots of moving parts.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.640]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.400]   And then it said, "So how much?" at the end.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   And I watched her work through it,
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.360]   and I watched her get it wrong.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   And I know that it was because the question said, "Helpers."
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.720]   And the answer did not include Tom, only "Helpers."
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   And she was like, "No, it said, 'Helpers.'"
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   'Cause the answer that she was looking for
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.560]   wasn't even there.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.600]   And she thinks, "Helpers" means all four were working.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.080]   And so, there's nothing wrong with her brain.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.960]   - Exactly. - She is so specific
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.240]   in her language.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.360]   And she's taken tests that she, based on what she learned,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.720]   she said, "Mom, the right answer wasn't even there.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.760]   So I had to guess what they wanted me to say."
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.640]   So, and maybe it was, and maybe it wasn't.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.280]   You know, it could have been that she was wrong,
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.080]   or it could have been that the worldview
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.920]   from the book that this test is taken from
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.840]   does not have an answer that represents
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.880]   the worldview she read from.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.800]   - It's exactly right.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   And we are so blessed as the parent in the home,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.560]   every day, working shoulder to shoulder with our children,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.920]   to recognize that, and to know that,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.400]   and to be able to assess with that in mind.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.240]   I love that.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.040]   And that doesn't have to be what makes my year successful.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.200]   It can be my own observations.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   It can be the work we did.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.400]   I do the test because we need to do the test.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.000]   But that is not how I determine the success rate
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.040]   of what we learned.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.440]   - So how do you determine the success rate?
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:39.360]   - If they completed what I asked them to complete,
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.040]   and completed it with the standard
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.800]   that I believe is agreed upon between my children and me,
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.600]   I do not think that I expect way more
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.160]   than they think is reasonable.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:59.360]   I would say that they understand our family expectations,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.280]   and they know when they're meeting them
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.240]   and when they're not.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.880]   And they've come to me if they were sick that week,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.160]   or something, or if it was really hard,
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.040]   or longer than expected, and said,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.480]   I'm doing my best, or I got behind, and what do I do now?
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.000]   So even helping them, for them to be able to assess,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.360]   I'm not meeting a standard.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.920]   That's fantastic, that they can assess that on their own.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.560]   And then we can decide, is this a poor planning thing,
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.480]   and what's our response going to be?
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.160]   Or is this that this is just not gonna happen
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.720]   because of circumstances that are happening?
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.160]   And we can decide what our response to that will be.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.880]   And they're gonna need that as an adult.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.680]   They're gonna need to decide
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.640]   if they're running late somewhere,
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.880]   does that mean we still stop for coffee?
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.200]   Or does that mean that I don't take the coffee
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.240]   and I head on to work?
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.120]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.080]   - So, or I was having a hard day.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.680]   Do I still also have to stay up till two in the morning
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.520]   working on this?
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   Or is it okay for me to go to the Lord and say,
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.400]   I just need some rest right now?
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.120]   - Yeah.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.520]   I think that's really cool.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.360]   We do set examples for our students
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   about what right assessment is all about.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:23.600]   I think that we give them
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.920]   the tools to assess themselves
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   and the knowledge that assessment is more
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   than just a number on a paper or on a test.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.840]   That assessment includes all those things
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.200]   that we've been talking about.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.720]   The expectations, the intentions,
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.040]   the degree of effort that we put into it,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.720]   our attitude toward our work
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.920]   and toward our parent and toward ourselves
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.600]   and toward our community, all of that.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.680]   Here's the last question I want to ask you today, Jill.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   How can we, how do we celebrate our students
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:24.000]   on the growth they had this year?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.440]   How do we, and Anne, how do we help them see assessment
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.800]   is natural and good and helpful?
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.280]   - Well, I think they can see assessment
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.200]   as natural, good, and helpful
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.240]   when we make it a positive experience
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.240]   and when we also assess ourselves.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.880]   When they see this isn't just an assessment for them,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.320]   but when we talk about our own thing,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.920]   even if it is, you know, back to the dinner,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.400]   if we say, wow, you know, I think next time I would.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.680]   I, and we do that, you know, or if we're going on vacation,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.200]   well, I'm not taking this interstate again.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   Next time we're going to do this.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.520]   (laughs)
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.520]   If we, if they see us realize
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.600]   where we need to do something different and then apply it,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.680]   then even if it's a conversation with them, say,
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.840]   you know what, I realized I did this wrong with you.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.680]   Next time, this is what I will do.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.720]   Those kinds of, they might not recognize that as assessment,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.360]   but we show them, we can say now,
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.480]   just like I had to make an adjustment in my recipe,
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.960]   I'm asking you, how can we make an adjustment
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.880]   in your process here?
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.240]   So we can show them that it is an assessment.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   And I think that, that helps it to become natural and good.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.360]   - Well, I just want to say to you, I love this.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.840]   When we show them that assessment is positive
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.960]   and not punishment.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.800]   - Yes.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   - Assessment is about what assessment should be
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:07.480]   about how we are growing and how we can grow,
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.240]   not a stick to beat us up about what went wrong.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.680]   - Right, God doesn't do that.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.920]   He, I mean, He corrects us by showing us truth
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   and by pulling us toward goodness, not by beating us up.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.000]   And so the beating up was under the law.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.800]   You know, the beating up was you'll never meet this standard
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   was you'll never be good enough.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.200]   And so now that Jesus paid for us,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.400]   He put His standard in us.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   Instead of us having to race around trying to meet it,
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   He put it in there already.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.560]   It's part of us, His nature.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.880]   And so relying on Him,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.480]   'cause we could never meet that standard on our own.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.880]   Never, never, never.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.920]   And so Jesus came and He didn't lower the standard.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.760]   He didn't say, "Okay, now sin is allowed in holiness."
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.440]   Instead, He just made us holy.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   I mean.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.640]   - That's great.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.960]   - The standard doesn't change.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.000]   The standard of excellence doesn't change,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.280]   but the equipping for excellence
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.600]   is where we can make adjustments.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.720]   Jesus equipped us for holiness
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   and gave us the ability to live like a child of God.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.200]   And it doesn't mean we don't have times
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.680]   that we do things wrong and that we need to go back
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.520]   and fix things or repent or make a change.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.440]   But the ability is there and the equipping is there.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.080]   And so equipping our children to think for themselves,
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.720]   equipping our children to assess rightly,
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.840]   equipping our children to trust God and ask God,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.280]   ask for help and be honest with themselves
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.360]   is where we don't change the standard,
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.640]   we equip the student.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.800]   - I love that.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.440]   We equip the students.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.800]   And that is the key to assessment.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   Assessment is not a dark and scary thing.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.160]   It is not a dark and scary topic.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.040]   It is about the continuation of the equipping
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.640]   that we are providing for our students
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.560]   joyfully as we homeschool them.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   And so listeners, I hope that Jill has helped you to see
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.720]   that assessment is not a sad day.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.080]   It is not a sad process.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.240]   It is all bound up in celebration
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.280]   and to celebrate is what God has brought us through
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.000]   as a family together and the ways that we have grown
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.160]   more like Him this year because of what we have done.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.720]   And if we discover something that we didn't grow
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.640]   in the way we thought we would, that's a good thing.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.440]   The assessment has brought that to light
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   and we can do something differently in the future
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.520]   to come back toward our goal.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.640]   That's really cool.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.720]   Thank you so much for sharing all of this today.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.560]   - Absolutely.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.240]   It was always, well, it is always wonderful to be with you
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.680]   and it was a lot of fun.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.000]   - I think it is a great time for us to talk together.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.920]   And families, as we end this podcast,
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.280]   I want to tell you about something.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.080]   If you're looking for something to do as a family
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.200]   to celebrate the end of your year,
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.840]   to celebrate what the Lord has done in your homeschool,
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.200]   I want to make you aware of something
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   called the International Association for Creation,
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.040]   the Creation Trail.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:56.080]   It has partnered with certified Bible guides
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.280]   to offer in-person biblical worldview tours
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.880]   of world-class secular museums

[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:22.440]   and show you how that biblical worldview
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.560]   is portrayed or not portrayed,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.160]   maybe in what you see in the museums
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.080]   across the United States.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:33.400]   There are exclusive discounts on tours for families

[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.880]   You could even go as a group from CC,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.600]   maybe your challenge class would want to do that.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.600]   If you want to find out about the exclusive CC discount code

[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.640]   the end of a great year as your family
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.440]   brings your homeschooling year to a close.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.520]   Families, thank you.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.920]   I hope that you've gotten a new view on celebration
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.400]   and a new view on assessment and how they can go together.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.440]   Jill, thank you again for your insights.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.760]   - Absolutely, thank you.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.640]   I learned a lot today too.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.560]   - All right, bye guys.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   See you next time.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.720]   you
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.780]   you
