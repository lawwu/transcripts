[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860]   Do angels carry our prayers to God? Do angels play a mediating role between us
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.400]   and heaven? That's today's question. And what makes this question especially
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.440]   interesting is a theme that we've already looked at three times on the
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.520]   podcast in the past, and that's the fact that the angels do hold the prayers of
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.080]   the saints. They hold them. That's the glorious point of Revelation chapter 8
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.680]   verses 3 to 5, that the prayers of the saints, our prayers, accumulate in golden
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.960]   bowls full of incense, bowls that are held up by the angels according to
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.360]   Revelation 5-8. It's an incredibly encouraging image, it's meant to be,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.520]   because God wants us to know that every one of our prayers, our answered prayers
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.320]   and our yet unanswered prayers, all of them are heard by Him, are precious to
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.560]   Him, and always exist before Him. It's a trio of glorious truths that we saw in
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.480]   APJ episodes 37, 630, and 1226. Just an amazing image for us to grasp. But this
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.320]   question today is different. Do angels carry our prayers to God? That's the
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.920]   question on Barb's Mind, a listener to the podcast. Pastor John, hello. Do angels
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.880]   carry our prayers to God? I've heard this ever since I was a little girl, but
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.240]   passages like 1 Timothy 2.5 seem to suggest otherwise. Pastor John, what
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.720]   would you say to Barb? I had a grandmother growing up, lived with us,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.640]   who embodied some of the impulses, I think, for why over the centuries some
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.960]   churches and people have felt the need to shrink back from direct Christian
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.160]   access to God through Jesus, instead to put various other beings between us and
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.520]   God to represent us before Him. Barb, in this question, mentions angels as a
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.400]   go-between. And in Roman Catholicism, the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, is put
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   between us and God as a mediator. People all over the world, sadly, pray to Mary,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   say their Hail Marys, do their rosary, instead of coming to God directly and
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.640]   confidently and humbly through Jesus alone. My grandmother was fond of saying,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.120]   as she declined to participate in family devotions, to the great grief of my
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.160]   father, "God has more important things to do than listen to my prayers." Now, on the
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.960]   face of it, that sounds humble. It is meant to sound humble, but in reality
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.560]   it's not humility. It's a form of Christ-belittling, Christ-rejecting pride.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.280]   Her supposed sense of unworthiness was not the reason she didn't pray. She
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.480]   didn't pray because she did not believe the Word of God. She did not believe and
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.280]   cherish who Jesus was and the price he paid to open the door to God for sinners.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:41.600]   Her refusal to come to God the way God offered, through Christ, was not a humble
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.440]   refusal. It was a self-asserting refusal to see herself as needing a Savior whose
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:58.360]   life and death were utterly, gloriously sufficient to open the way to God and
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   bid her come boldly to God. She did not believe that God is glorified by
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.920]   welcoming our burdens and carrying them like a strong God that he is for us. And
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.240]   she didn't believe that what Jesus did on the cross and what he's doing today
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   in heaven would be glorified if she really humbled herself and was stunned
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.480]   out of her mind with wonder that the Son of God came into the world to open a way
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.320]   for repentant sinners beyond all imagination to come into the presence of
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.360]   the infinitely holy God through Christ alone and find a fatherly reception
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.200]   rather than incineration. She did not believe and millions don't believe that
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:05.760]   the infinite blazing holiness of God is so great that no angel nor the mother of
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   God, Mary, could be a better protection for us than Christ. Let me say that again.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.720]   That's just so crucial. She didn't believe, millions don't believe, that the
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   infinite blazing holiness of God is so great that no angel, no mother of God,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:35.080]   could be a better protection for us than Christ. If we're going to approach
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:44.240]   infinite holiness in prayer now, in fellowship with God now, and finally
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.920]   approach him face to face, then the thought of adding Mary or an angel, the
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:59.200]   thought of adding them to Christ for supplementary protection and acceptance
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.240]   is absurd. It's simply absurd. It's like saying, "Well, I've got an asbestos
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.880]   fire suit here and it's 12 inches thick. Now let's add a layer of tissue paper to
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.960]   make it more resilient." There is not one scripture that teaches us to approach
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:28.560]   God through angels or through Mary. Not one. Let that sink in. Not one. All of that
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:38.960]   insertion between us and God, in addition to Christ, is unbiblical tradition.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.880]   It is a dishonor to Christ and what he accomplished on the cross and what he's
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.360]   doing today. So let me celebrate with you for just a moment the glories of Christ's
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.320]   finished work for us on the cross and its ongoing application to us in heaven
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.480]   as he intercedes today for us and opens the way to God moment by moment for you
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.440]   to come. So we start with that text that Barb mentions in her question, 1st
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.600]   Timothy 2.5. "There is one God and there is one mediator between God and men, the
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.240]   man Christ Jesus." There are not multiple mediators that make it possible to
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.000]   relate to God joyfully without being destroyed. There's not. Christ and Christ
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.040]   alone accomplished this once for all. Then there's the glorious clear
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.400]   statement of Paul in Ephesians 2.17 and 18 and chapter 3 verse 12. Christ came in
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.080]   to the world to preach peace to those who are far off and peace to those who
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:08:00.200]   are near. Here's the key phrase, "Through him we have access in one spirit to the
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:09.120]   Father." And then this phrase, "In him we have boldness and access." I mean, could it
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.720]   be clearer? "In him we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:23.520]   in him." That's 3.12 Ephesians. And how did Christ do that? How did he open the way
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.440]   for sinners to come boldly through him to the creator of the universe in
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:38.000]   infinite holiness? Ephesians 2.16, "He reconciled us both to God in one body."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.480]   Key phrase, "Through the cross." Glory. I love it. What a great gospel. Through the cross,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.760]   through his death. Or here's the way it's put in Hebrews 10.19, "We have confidence
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:09:01.160]   to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh." So the blood of
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   Jesus and the torn body of Jesus dying on the cross in our place covers our
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.760]   sins, provides us with the righteousness we need to stand in the presence of the
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:33.120]   holy creator of all things. And then the living risen Christ goes on today, forever,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.640]   interceding for us by pleading his perfect sacrifice. Romans 8.34, "Who is to
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.800]   condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died. More than that, who was raised, who is at
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:57.080]   the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us right now as I talk."
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.800]   Or 1 John 2.1 puts it like this, "I am writing these things to you so that you
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:13.680]   may not sin, but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   Christ the righteous." We don't need another advocate. It's almost blasphemy, I
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.800]   want to say, to say we need another advocate or some intercessor or mediator
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:34.360]   besides Christ. And it's forever. Hebrews 7.25, "Jesus is able to save to the
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:43.160]   uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.040]   make intercession for them." Always, always, and forever welcoming us to God
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.400]   through his work. So how do we come into the presence of a holy God in prayer and
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.600]   fellowship now? How do we come? Here's Hebrews 10.19, "We have confidence to
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.720]   enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.120]   opened for us through the curtain, through his flesh." Can't say it too many
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.000]   times. So, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.920]   heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us come with confidence and draw near to the
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:35.120]   throne of grace. And how do we pray as we come to this throne through Jesus? Do we
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.520]   hold on to a rosary and pray our Hail Marys as if the Mother of God could
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:48.600]   improve on the access that Jesus has made? Do we call down some angel and hope
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:57.640]   he has greater access with our prayers than the Son of God? No, we don't. Here's
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.400]   what Jesus said, and this is simply amazing how precious, glorious,
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:12.440]   unthinkable it is. He said, "In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:20.200]   that I will ask the Father on your behalf, for the Father himself loves you
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.840]   because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God." In other
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:34.480]   words, when you speak to God, pray to God, the infinitely holy Creator of the
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.720]   universe, "In my name," Jesus says, "that is, in my forgiveness, my righteousness, I
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:50.760]   don't even have to ask Father to hear you. He loves you. He loves you as
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.120]   he loved me. That's what it means for me to be the one and only mediator between
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:06.480]   you and God. Trust me, sis, come to God through me." Yes, come to God through
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.320]   Christ. It's a bold offer, a bold promise. Thank you, Pastor John, for that, and
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.160]   thank you for the question, Barb. Hebrews chapter 10 and 19 grants us this
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.000]   confidence. It tells us that we have confidence to enter the holy places by
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.360]   the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:32.760]   curtain, through his flesh. Amen. That is a glorious fact that we cannot repeat
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.600]   too often, so next time we're gonna say it again, we're gonna celebrate it again
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.760]   from another angle. Thank you for joining us today. Ask a question of your own.
