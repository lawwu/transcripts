[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Bhaskar Sankara.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.600]   He's a democratic socialist, a political writer,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.440]   founding editor of Jacobin, president of the nation,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   former vice chair of the Democratic Socialists of America,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.760]   and the author of "The Socialist Manifesto,"
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760]   the case for radical politics
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.080]   in an era of extreme inequality.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.480]   As a side note, let me say that this conversation
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.880]   with Bhaskar Sankara,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   who's a brilliant socialist writer and philosopher,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.160]   represents what I hope to do with this podcast.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.440]   I hope to talk to the left and the right,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.520]   to the far left and the far right,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.080]   always with the goal of presenting and understanding
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.920]   both the strongest interpretation of their ideas
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   and valuable thought-provoking arguments
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.560]   against those ideas.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.640]   Also, I hope to understand the human being
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   behind the ideas.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.200]   I trust in your intelligence as the listener
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.000]   to use the ideas you hear to help you learn,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.120]   to think, to empathize, and to make up your own mind.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.360]   I will often fall short in pushing back too hard
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.440]   or not pushing back enough,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.080]   of not bringing up topics I should have,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.800]   of talking too much, of interrupting too much,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.240]   or maybe sometimes, in the rare cases, not enough,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.560]   of being too silly on a serious topic
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280]   or being too serious on a silly topic.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.720]   I'm trying to do my best,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   and I will keep working my ass off to improve.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.480]   In this way, I hope to talk to prominent figures
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.360]   in the political space, even controversial ones,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.440]   on both the left and the right.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.240]   For example, I hope to talk to Donald Trump
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.120]   and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.320]   to Ron DeSantis and Barack Obama,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   and of course, many others across the political spectrum.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.360]   I sometimes hear accusations about me being controlled
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.640]   in some way by a government or an intelligence agency,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.760]   like CIA, FSB, Mossad,
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.360]   or perhaps that I'm controlled in some way
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.000]   by the very human desire for money, fame, power, access.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.920]   All I have is my silly little words,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.600]   but let me give them to you.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.800]   I'm not and will never be controlled by anyone.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.720]   There's nothing in this world that can break me
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   and force me to sacrifice my integrity.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.400]   People call me naive.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.880]   I'm not naive.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.400]   I'm optimistic.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   And optimism isn't a passive state of being.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.200]   It's a constant battle against the world
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   that wants to pull you into a downward spiral of cynicism.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.400]   To me, optimism is freedom,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.320]   freedom to think, to act, to build, to help,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.120]   at times in the face of impossible odds.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.040]   As I often do, please allow me to read a few lines
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.480]   from the poem "If" by Rajar Kipling.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.840]   If you can keep your head when all about you
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.560]   are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160]   if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.640]   but make allowance for their doubting too,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.280]   if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.880]   or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.040]   or being hated, don't give way to hating,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.280]   and yet don't look too good or talk too wise.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.520]   Even this very poem is mocking
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.480]   my over-romantic ridiculousness as I read it.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.240]   The meta-irony is not lost on me, my friends.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.480]   I'm a silly little kid
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.840]   trying to do a bit of good in this world.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.480]   Thank you for having my back through all of it,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.260]   all of my mistakes.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.400]   Thank you for the love.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.800]   To support it,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.000]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.660]   And now, dear friends, here's Bhaskar Sankara.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.760]   Let's start with a big, broad question.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.680]   What is socialism?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.120]   How do you like to define it?
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.400]   How do you like to think about it?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.580]   - Well, there's so many socialists out there,
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.200]   and we can't seem to agree about anything.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.220]   So my definition, I'm sure, is really just my definition,
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.960]   but I think at the minimum,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.520]   socialism is about making sure
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.000]   that the core necessities of life,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.360]   food, housing, education, and so on,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.440]   are guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of being born
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.200]   so that those people can reach their potential.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   And I think that's a minimum requirement of socialism.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.560]   Beyond that, I think socialism,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440]   especially democratic socialism,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320]   the type of socialism that I believe in,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.760]   is about taking democracy
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.560]   from just the political democratic realm
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.080]   and extending it into economic and social spheres as well.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   So if we think that democracy is a good thing,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.480]   why do we allow our workplaces
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   to be run in autocratic ways?
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   - So economic, political, social,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.280]   in all those realms, the ideas,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.640]   the philosophical ideas apply.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.240]   Like what are, if you can put words to it,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   what are some philosophical ideas about human beings
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.000]   that are at the core of this?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.440]   - I think at the core,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.980]   it's the idea that we have intrinsic value.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.920]   We are individuals that have unequal talents, of course.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   We're individuals that want different things.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   But this unique individualness
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   can only truly come to light in a society
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.720]   in which there are certain collective or social guarantees.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.080]   So we could think, just like Stephen Jay Gould,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.040]   the scientist and socialist used to say,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.200]   about how many thousands of potential Einsteins
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.760]   or Leonardo da Vinci's that died in sweatshops
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.320]   and on plantations
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.640]   and never got the chance to cultivate
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.720]   what was unique and human about themselves
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.600]   and also never got a chance to have families
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.820]   and impart what was special and important to them
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.680]   to future generations and to posterity.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.560]   My own grandmother was born in Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.840]   She was illiterate till her dying days.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.120]   She, in East Orange, New Jersey,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.280]   she never had the chance to write down
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.540]   her memories of her life in Trinidad as a young woman
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.960]   and what it meant.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.200]   She, of course, had lots of children
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.040]   and she was able to impart some stories
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.880]   to her children and grandchildren.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.040]   But I often think about what someone with her wit
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.960]   and intelligence could have done
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.560]   with a little bit more support.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.720]   - But if all human beings have intrinsic value,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.880]   you don't have to be an Einstein
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.320]   for the application of some of the ideas
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   that you're talking about.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.200]   Is there a tension or a trade-off
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.080]   between our human civilization, our society,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.360]   helping the unlucky versus rewarding
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.620]   the skillful and the hardworking?
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.760]   - I think you could do both.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   There's always a balance between the two.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.640]   I think you could reward people who make innovations
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.000]   and who improve lives for everyone through their innovations
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.240]   by giving them, let's say, even more consumption,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   even that level of inequality,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.360]   while still making sure that there's not people
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.920]   in poverty and suffering,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.440]   and while making sure that, hey,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   we're gonna give these people who want to work
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.920]   that extra 10 hours or 20 hours
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   or want to apply their hard work some extra benefits,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.960]   but that these benefits would be
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.040]   not the extreme disparities that you have today.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.400]   - So at the core of socialism
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.220]   and maybe democratic socialism
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.400]   is maybe a reallocation of wealth,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   reallocation of resources?
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.920]   - I think it's wealth and resources, yes,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.620]   but it's also power.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.720]   And I guess one way to think about this is
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.600]   some thinkers on the right, like Hayek,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.920]   they would say in their most generous moments
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.100]   talking about socialists and socialism,
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.760]   they would say, "Socialists want to trade
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.440]   "some of your freedom for equality."
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.840]   And that's them trying to just accurately describe
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.880]   what socialism is trying to do.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.920]   The way that I would put it, it's a little bit different.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.880]   Socialists are proposing a trade-off,
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.120]   but it's really a trade-off between freedom and freedom.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.640]   And by that, I mean,
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.400]   let's say you set up a successful business
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   and you set up a business right here in Austin, Texas,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.720]   some sort of firm, it's producing some widget or whatever,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.560]   and it's producing a good that people really want and demand
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.000]   but you have some competition.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.240]   You decide to hire 20, 30 people to help you.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.200]   You entered into a free contract with these people
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.820]   who under capitalism, of course,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.320]   we're not living in feudalism,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.880]   have the option to join any other firm,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.560]   but they like you and they like this firm
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.620]   and they like your offer and you're paying them,
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   let's say $20 an hour for 40 hours of work per week.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.120]   Now, if the government comes along and says,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.920]   okay, there's now a new minimum wage,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.000]   the minimum wage is $22 an hour.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.440]   And also there's a maximum work week, 35 hour work week.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.520]   And if you work someone over 35 hours, even if they agree,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.040]   you have to pay them time and a half.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.520]   Now, that of course is now an abridgment
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.360]   of your freedom as an entrepreneur,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.640]   your freedom to set certain terms of employment
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.960]   and to engage in a contract with free people.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.040]   But now your workers and other workers in the sector,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.280]   'cause if you did it unilaterally,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   you'd just get undercut by your competition.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   Now, these people now have a few extra hours a week,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.880]   they can do whatever they want with,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.720]   they could watch more NFL with it,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.440]   they could spend more time with their friends or family
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   or whatever else, and they're still getting paid the same,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.640]   if not better, 'cause the wages also went up.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.720]   So it's really a question often of trade-offs
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   between whose freedom and autonomy
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.000]   are you going to prioritize,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.120]   the freedom and autonomy of the entrepreneur
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   or the capitalist in this case,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.760]   or the freedom and autonomy of ordinary workers.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.480]   Now, you could create a society that swings
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.040]   so far in the direction of prioritizing the freedom
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   of one group or one class or whatever else
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.960]   compared to another, that you end up in some sort of tyranny.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   Now, if the state said, you know, you Lex,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.280]   you're a capitalist, so you don't get the right to vote,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.960]   or we're gonna take away your private home
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   or your ability to do things
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.960]   that we think are intrinsic human rights.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now, this would be tyranny,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   this would be an abridgment of your rights,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.720]   but shaping your ability in the economic sphere
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.320]   to be an economic actor is, I think,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.800]   within the realm and scope of democratic politics.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.160]   - Yeah, so those are the extremes you're referring to.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.480]   And one perspective I like to take
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.800]   on socialism versus capitalism is,
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.680]   under each system, the extremes of each systems
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.880]   and the moderate versions of each system,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.160]   how can people take advantage of it?
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.600]   So it seems like no matter what part of human nature is,
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   whatever the rules, whatever the framework,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.320]   whatever the system, somebody's gonna take advantage of it.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.720]   And that's a kind of pragmatic look at it.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.360]   In practice, what actually happens?
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.040]   Also, the incentives and the human behavior,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.840]   what actually happens in practice under these systems?
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.040]   So if you have a higher and higher minimum wage
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.320]   and people watch more and more NFL,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.200]   how does that change their actual behavior
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.240]   as a productive member of society?
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.640]   And actually at the individual level,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.240]   as somebody who could be an Einstein
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.680]   and chooses not to because NFL is so awesome to watch.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.600]   So is both how do people,
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.960]   malicious people that wanna take advantage,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.920]   maybe not malicious, but people that like me are lazy
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.960]   and wanna take advantage.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.320]   And people that also I think like me,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.520]   like I tend to believe about myself that I have potential.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.640]   And if I let my laziness naturally take over,
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.480]   which it often does, I won't materialize the potential.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   So if you make life too easy for me,
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.680]   I feel like I will never get anything done.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.360]   Me personally, of course,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.280]   there's a giant set of circumstances
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.400]   of the unlucky and the overburden and so on.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.440]   Okay, so how can people take advantage of each system,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.080]   socialism, capitalism?
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920]   - So for one thing,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.040]   people are going to take advantage of systems.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   They're gonna find loopholes,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.160]   they're gonna find ways around,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.240]   they're gonna find ways to at times,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   dominate and coerce others,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.920]   even in systems meant to get rid of domination and coercion.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.160]   That's why we need to design our systems
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.800]   in such a way that it eliminates
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   as many of these things as possible.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.160]   And also that's why we need democracy, we need freedom.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.320]   So in a Soviet system, for instance,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   you had the rise of this authoritarian bureaucracy
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.840]   that dominated and coerced others in the name of socialism.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.640]   Now that system desperately could have used
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   some political democracy and some checks
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.200]   on what people were doing
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.360]   and some ability to reverse their power, right?
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.680]   And as soon as of course,
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.760]   little elements of democracy was brought to that system,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.160]   the system collapsed because there started to be outlets
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.200]   for dissent and for dissatisfaction.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.240]   So I think we can't design a priori a perfect system.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.480]   We need to be committed to certain principles
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.320]   that allow systems to be perfected.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.440]   And for me, that's the importance of democracy.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.080]   So even a few years ago, not to go on a tangent,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.400]   but people were alluding Chinese authoritarianism
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.440]   and they're saying, China's building this efficient system.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   The state runs so well, there's technocratic excellence,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.800]   plus there's just productivity
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   and they're just working harder than Americans
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.440]   and whatever else.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.560]   But look at in practice, what really happened with COVID,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.160]   both the initial suppressing of information
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.320]   about what was happening in Wuhan and the outbreak
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.680]   where many ordinary Chinese workers and doctors
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.160]   and others were trying to get the word out
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   and they were suppressed by communist party officials
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.320]   locally in Wuhan, probably with the collusion nationally.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.600]   And now with zero COVID policies and whatever else.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.360]   So I think that often we find that even though it seems
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.600]   like these are weak systems and democracy makes us
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.840]   less competent technocratically and otherwise,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.520]   I think it's kind of a necessity for systems to grow
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   and evolve to have that freedom in civil society.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   But as for individuals, now the first part of it is,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.560]   yeah, I think people should be free
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.840]   to make their own choices.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.800]   You might have tremendous potential,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.600]   but you might choose to spend it in leisure.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   And leisure doesn't only mean doing,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.360]   sitting around at home, drinking a bunch of beers,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.040]   kind of wasting your life away that way.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.320]   Leisure might mean spending more time
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.000]   with your friends and family,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.080]   building these sort of relationships
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.480]   that are gonna maybe not change the world
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.200]   in some meta sense, but will change the lives
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.120]   of the people around you and will change your community
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720]   for the better.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.800]   - I'm taking notes here 'cause for me,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.520]   leisure just meant playing a lot of Skyrim.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.120]   This whole family relationship thing,
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.320]   I'm gonna have to work on that.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.360]   I didn't realize that's also including leisure.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.560]   So I'm gonna have to reconsider my whole life here.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.400]   Anyway.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   - No, leisure should mean sitting activity too, right?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.480]   I mean, there's that famous book,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.320]   the Robert Putnam one, "Bowling Alone" or whatever,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.480]   which described it for now.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.640]   I mean, I'm, it was born in 1989.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.920]   I like video and computer games,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.680]   so I definitely do that type of leisure too,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.880]   but I found a lot more richness in my life
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.680]   when in the last decade, a lot of my leisure
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.080]   has returned to going to the local bar
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.000]   for the couple of drinks I have a week
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.480]   instead of doing it at home alone,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.880]   watching TV or something,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.240]   'cause you get that random conversation,
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.720]   that sense of a place and belonging.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.680]   But I guess what's the undercurrent maybe
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.320]   of your question was,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.040]   now, if you have a system with lots of carrots,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.760]   but not the whip of, hey, you might be destitute,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   you might be unemployed,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.160]   you might not be able to support yourself
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.920]   unless you're working a certain amount,
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   would we still be as productive?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.640]   Would we still be able to generate enough value for society?
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.360]   And I think that that's a question
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.160]   that is quite interesting.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.520]   I think that we're living in a society now
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.720]   with enough abundance that we could afford
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.440]   more people deciding to opt out of the system,
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.560]   out of production,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.240]   and that the carrots of staying in,
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.800]   more money for consumption,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.240]   more ability to do cool things,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.680]   more just social rewards
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.080]   that comes from being successful
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.960]   or from providing would be enough.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.800]   But that's another thing
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.680]   that would have to be balanced in a system.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:21.560]   So if we were seeing mass unemployment by choice
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.120]   in a democratic socialist system,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.240]   then you might need to reconfigure the incentives.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.920]   You might need to encourage people
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.240]   to go back into production.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.600]   But that's something that, again,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.400]   you could do through democracy
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.080]   and through good governance.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.200]   You don't have to set the perfect blueprint
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.640]   in motion,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.160]   write up a treatise now in 50 years from now,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.480]   try to follow it like it's scripture.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.240]   - So by the way,
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.480]   I do like how you said whip instead of stick
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.560]   in "Carrot and Stick."
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.880]   That's putting a weight on the scale of which is better.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.720]   But yes.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.040]   But I would actually argue to push back
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.000]   that the wealthier we get as a society, as a world,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.840]   that the more comfortable the social nets become.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   So the less of a whip or a stick they become.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.640]   Because one of the negative consequences,
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   even if you're on welfare,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.520]   is like, well, life is not gonna be that great.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.400]   But the wealthier we become,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.720]   the better the social programs become,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   the easier life becomes at the bottom.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And so you might not have this motivation financially
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   to get out from the bottom.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.560]   That said, the pushback on the pushback
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.920]   is that there's something about human nature in general,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.480]   money aside, that strives for greatness,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.000]   that strives to provide a great life,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   a great middle-class life for your family.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.920]   And so that's the motivator to get off from the bottom.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.200]   - Well, I think a lot of people
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.720]   who are stuck at the bottom of the labor market today,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.000]   one, these are people who are kind of,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.920]   are true philanthropists,
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.560]   'cause a lot of them are the ones who are working two jobs
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.480]   and are working 60 plus hours
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.520]   and are providing in this country,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   it's such a bargain for their labor
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.280]   'cause they're so underpaid,
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.160]   so many of the things that the rest of us use
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.200]   to enjoy life and consumption or whatever else.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.520]   Like I got here from downtown Austin,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.400]   and I think my lift, I did tip,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.480]   but I think my lift was like eight bucks base
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.760]   or whatever else.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.080]   It's the, I think that we are all indebted
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   to people who are working
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.320]   and we don't see it at various stages
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.840]   of the production process from the workers in China
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.000]   and Taiwan producing technological things
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.600]   that we're recording this on to growers
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.840]   and workers in agriculture in the US.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.720]   So I think that one,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.000]   working class people are already working,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   but as far as getting out from under poverty and desperation,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.840]   we're in a society that doesn't give people a lot of tools.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.760]   So if you don't have access to good public schools
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.600]   from age five until 12, 13,
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.160]   it's gonna be really hard to move from generations
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.240]   of your family being involved in manual labor
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.720]   to doing other forms of labor.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.560]   You're gonna be stuck at a certain part
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.800]   of our labor market as a result.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.000]   If you don't have access to decent healthcare
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.120]   throughout your life,
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.920]   you might be already preordained to an early grave
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.720]   by the time that something kicks in,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.000]   you really want to change something in your life
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.800]   in your mid twenties.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.440]   Obviously it's a combination of agency
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   and all these other factors.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.760]   There's still something,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.880]   I think innately human, innately striving
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.440]   that a lot of people have,
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.880]   but we don't really give people in our current society
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.680]   the tools to really be full participants in our society.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.960]   We just take for granted, for example,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.800]   and I'm from the Northeast,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.040]   I give like excessively Northeast example,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.320]   but we take for granted that someone from,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.160]   Hartford, Connecticut is gonna have,
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   your average working class person in Hartford
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.440]   is gonna have a very different life outcome
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.160]   than someone born on the same day, the same hour,
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.280]   in Greenwich, Connecticut.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.400]   We take for granted that accidents of birth
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.680]   are gonna dictate outcomes.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.960]   - So you mean like,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.520]   depending on the conditions of where you grew up,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.760]   there's going to be fundamentally different experience
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.520]   in terms of education,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.040]   in terms of the resources available to you
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.120]   to allow yourself to flourish.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.400]   - Yes, a poor city and a rich city,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.880]   and Connecticut is great.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.480]   It's highly, highly underrated.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.800]   Both New Yorkers and people from Boston
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.600]   kind of have a colonial feeling about Connecticut
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.360]   where we make fun of it and we try to carve it up.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.640]   The West belongs to New York, the East to Boston,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.040]   but I'm here for Connecticut nationalism.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.200]   I think it's a great place.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.760]   - Okay, can we actually step back a little bit
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.600]   on definitions?
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.680]   'Cause you said that some of the ideas practically
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.200]   that you're playing with is democratic socialism.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.600]   We talked about the higher level,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.920]   the higher kind of vision of socialism,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.960]   the ideals, the philosophical ideas,
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.080]   but how does it all fit into the big picture historically
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   of ideas of Marxism, communism, and socialism
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.760]   as it was defined and experienced
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.480]   and implemented in the 20th century?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.200]   So what's your key differences?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.280]   Maybe even just like socialism, communism.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.960]   - Yeah, well, I hate the no true Scotsman
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.920]   sort of response to this, which is,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.120]   oh, that socialism is bad.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.880]   So it wasn't really socialism.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.320]   And my socialism is good, so it is socialism.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.840]   But I think that socialism and communism
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.120]   share a common ancestor, which is they both emerged
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.920]   out of the turmoil and development
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.800]   of late 19th century capitalism.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.640]   And the fact that there was all these workers parties
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.600]   that were organizing across the capitalist world.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   So in Europe, for instance, you had this mass party
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.080]   called the German Social Democratic Party.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.560]   That became probably the most important,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.600]   the most vibrant party in Germany in the 1880s and 1890s,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.520]   but they were locked out of power
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   because Germany at the time was still mostly a Tarkic.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.480]   It had a parliamentary democracy,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.160]   but it was a very undemocratic democracy.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.080]   The Kaiser still ruled.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.560]   These movements took root across the capitalist world,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.040]   but including in Russia and in conditions of illegality.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.720]   So it was assumed for many, many years
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   in the workers movement across Europe
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.960]   and among socialists of Europe,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.320]   they called themselves social Democrats then,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.040]   that the revolution would first probably happen in Germany
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.800]   in this developed, growing hub of industrial capitalism
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.840]   and not in semi-feudal Russia.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.080]   But then World War I came,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.160]   the workers movement was split between parties
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.520]   that decided to either keep their head down
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.200]   or to implicitly support the war.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.760]   And then, you know, support the war for now,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.480]   keep your heads down, don't get banned, don't get arrested,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.880]   then we'll just take power after the war is over.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.400]   And those like Russia,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.480]   and also in the United States for that matter,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.120]   they chose the path of resistance to the war.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   And it was the Bolshevik faction of the Russian movement,
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:56.480]   Lenin's Bolshevik party that took power in Russia
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.240]   after a period of turmoil where it didn't seem,
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.160]   well, was it gonna go to the fascist right?
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.600]   Or was it gonna go to the far left?
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.440]   There was a period of flux and turmoil in Russia,
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.000]   but definitely the old regime was not able to stand.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And these Russian social Democrats, these Bolsheviks said,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   social democracy has so betrayed the idea
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.520]   of internationalism and brotherhood and progress
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.920]   that was supposed to stand for,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.360]   that we can't call ourselves social Democrats anymore.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.160]   We're gonna go back to this old term that Marx used,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.800]   we're gonna call ourselves communists.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.240]   And that's where official kind of communism
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.520]   out of Russia emerged.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.680]   In other parts of Europe,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.880]   parties were actually able to take power,
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.560]   some in the interwar period,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.520]   but most in the post-war period.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.640]   And they also came out of this
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.720]   old social democratic movement.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.960]   And these parties mostly just call themselves socialists.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.840]   And a lot of them still on paper
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.000]   wanted to go beyond capitalism,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.200]   but in practice, they just managed capitalism better
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.520]   in the interest of workers.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.360]   But they all had the same common ancestor.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   And in practice, to me, social democracy means
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.120]   trying to insert doses of socialism within capitalism,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.960]   but maintaining capitalism.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.240]   Communism met this attempt to build a socialism
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.360]   outside of capitalism and often authoritarian ways,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.720]   in part because of the ideology of these communists,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.360]   but in part because of the conditions
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.520]   in which they inherited.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.920]   They were inheriting a democracy,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.880]   they were inheriting a country
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.720]   that had been ruled by the czars for centuries.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.200]   And with very little condition,
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   like a very weak working class,
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.720]   a very poor and devastated by war and so on,
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.360]   where authoritarianism kind of
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.640]   lended itself to those conditions.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.280]   Then there's me.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.640]   Then there's democratic socialists.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.360]   And the way I would define it is,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.440]   we like a lot of what the social democrats accomplished,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.120]   but we still believe in going beyond capitalism
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.720]   and not just building socialism within capitalism,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   but we believe in this ultimate vision
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.360]   of a world after capitalism.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.280]   - What does that world look like
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.840]   and how is it different from communism?
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   Actually, maybe we can linger,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   before we talk about your vision of democratic socialism,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.960]   what was wrong with communism, Stalinism,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.160]   implementation of communism in the Soviet Union?
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.680]   Why did it go wrong?
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.960]   And in what ways did it not go wrong?
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   In what ways did it succeed?
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.440]   - Let me start with the second part of that question.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.720]   And that's a very difficult one to answer,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.400]   in part because I morally and ethically
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.720]   am opposed to any form of authoritarianism or dictatorship.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.320]   And often when you talk about the successes of a government
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.920]   or what it did developmentally that might've been positive,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   we have to abstract ourselves from what we morally believe
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.520]   and just kind of look at the record, right?
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:01.320]   I would say that the Soviet experiment
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.560]   started off in Lenin's time
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   as the attempt to kind of just a holding action.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.000]   Hey, we don't really have the conditions
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.120]   to rule this country.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.880]   We have the support of the working class or most of it,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.440]   but the working class is only 3% of the population.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.640]   The peasantry is really against us.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   A lot of this 3% of the population has died in war
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.400]   and half of them supported the Mensheviks
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   and the more moderate socialists anyway.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.520]   But the alternative in their minds
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.920]   was going to be a far right reaction,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.840]   some sort of general taking power in a coup or whatever else
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.480]   or just them ending up back in prison
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.120]   'cause a lot of them were in prison under the czar
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   or just killed.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.840]   So they figured, all right,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.320]   we're gonna have a holding action
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.480]   where we maintain as much of this territory
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.080]   of the old Russian empire as possible.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.760]   We'll try to slowly implement changes,
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.920]   restabilize the economy through something called
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.520]   the New Economic Program,
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.120]   which was kind of a form of social democracy, if you will,
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.640]   'cause it allowed market exchange for the peasants
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.320]   combined with state ownership of industries in the cities.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.520]   And for a while, it seemed to be working.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.760]   The revolution never came that they were expecting
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.560]   in Western Europe, but in Russia itself,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.240]   they were able to restabilize things
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.000]   by the middle or end of the 1920s.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.360]   And they were able to build more of a popular base
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.520]   for some of their policies because people who had seen
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.240]   the chaos of World War I and revolution and then civil war
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.680]   kind of just wanted stability.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.360]   And after a decade plus of war,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   if you had a government that was able to give you enough
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.600]   to eat and a job, that was good enough for them.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.040]   Then Stalin came into power
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.800]   and he wanted to rapidly industrialize.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.600]   And his logic was the revolution's not gonna come
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.680]   in the West.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.080]   We need to build socialism in one country
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.640]   and we need to catch up with the West.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.120]   We need to turn ourselves into industrial powerhouse
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.040]   as quickly as possible.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.240]   And that's where you got forced collectivization
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.720]   to try to increase the productivity of Russian agriculture
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.600]   through state ownership of previously fragmented
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.320]   agricultural holdings and through the implementation
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.640]   of mechanization, so bringing in more machines
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.080]   to make agriculture more productive,
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.600]   all under state ownership.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.040]   Plus more ambitious attempts to build heavy industry
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.480]   through five-year plans.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.240]   Now, I say this kind of coolly,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.640]   but we know in practice what that meant.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.760]   Forced collectivization was a disaster.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.800]   I mean, first of all, I think it was built
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.360]   on the faulty premise that scale always equals
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.520]   more productivity when in fact, especially in agriculture,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.440]   but in any field, it's a little bit more complicated
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.280]   than that.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.240]   And it led to millions of deaths, it led to a famine,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.080]   it led to a host of other problems.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.960]   Industrialization in the way that it happened under Stalin
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.800]   also kind of unbalanced the Soviet economy
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.160]   to lean too heavy towards heavy industry,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.320]   not enough for medium or light industry.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.560]   But this did mean, especially the five-year plan
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.640]   and industrialization did manage to put Russia
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.000]   on a different developmental trajectory.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.400]   So by the time the post-war period came,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.160]   one, it might've gave them the ability to survive
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.640]   the Nazi invasion to begin with,
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.160]   so that's a complicated question.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.880]   And then by the time the post-war period came,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.600]   Russia had kind of jumped ahead
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.480]   of its developmental trajectory in a way
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.640]   that a lot of other countries didn't do.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.720]   There are a few examples, like Japan is one,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.880]   they managed to.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.240]   If you kind of ran a scenario where Japan would be
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.360]   in the 1870s, 1880s and ran it a hundred times,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.720]   the Japan of the post-war period
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.160]   is kind of one of the best outcomes, right?
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.920]   And I think that you could say that
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.040]   about Russian economic development,
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.960]   its ability to catch up at a certain level to the West.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.840]   And then after that, of course, later on,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.280]   as economies got more complex,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.080]   as they kind of moved beyond regular heavy industry
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.640]   and as the main stable of the economy,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.960]   the Russian economy and its command system
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.760]   was unable to adapt and cope
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   and ended up falling back behind the West again
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.600]   by the 1970s.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.760]   So all this is a very long story to say
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.920]   that a lot went wrong in Russia.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.200]   The economic picture is actually
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.840]   a little bit more complicated.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.040]   Politically, I think it's just a small party
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.960]   without much popular support,
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.040]   but with real popular support in a couple of cities,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.640]   but a lot without a lot of popular support,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.920]   empire wide, took power
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   and they felt like they couldn't get back power.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.760]   And they kept holding on to power
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.640]   and eventually among their ranks in these conditions,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.440]   one of history's great tyrants took power
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.320]   and was able to justify what he was doing
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.440]   in the context of the Russian nation and development,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.240]   but also all the threats that came from abroad.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.600]   The Civil War wasn't just a civil war,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.080]   it was really an invasion by many imperial powers
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.720]   all around the world as well.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.920]   So I think a lot of it was conditions and circumstance.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.360]   And I guess the question really is,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.240]   to what role ideology played?
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.080]   Was there something within the socialist tradition
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.520]   that might've lended itself to authoritarianism?
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.640]   And that's something we should talk about.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.280]   - And that's a really complicated human question.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   It does seem that the rhetoric,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.960]   the populism of workers unite,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.480]   we've been fucked over for way too long.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.520]   Let's stand together.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.840]   Somehow that message allows flawed
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.240]   or evil people to take power.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.000]   It seems like the rhetoric, the idea is so good.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.640]   Maybe the utopian nature of the idea is so good
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.700]   that it allows a great speaker to take power.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.880]   It's almost like if the mission,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.520]   like come with me, friends, beyond the horizon,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.320]   a great land is waiting for us.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.280]   That encourages sort of, yeah, dictators,
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.680]   authoritarians to take power.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.300]   Is there something within the ideology
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.980]   that allows for that, for the sort of,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.400]   for lying to people, essentially?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.880]   - Well, I might surprise you with my answer
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.760]   'cause I would say yes, maybe.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.000]   But I think that it's not just socialism.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.880]   Any sort of ideology that appeals to the collective
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.400]   and appeals to our long-term destiny,
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.740]   either as a species or as a nation
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.800]   or as a class or whatever else,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.420]   can lend itself to authoritarianism.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.320]   So you can see this in many of the nationalisms
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.880]   of the 20th century.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.240]   Now, some of these nationalisms
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.520]   use incredibly lofty collective rhetoric,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.680]   like in Sweden, the rhetoric of,
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.420]   we're gonna create the people's home.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.800]   We're gonna make this a country with dignity
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.840]   for all Swedes.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.200]   We're gonna make this a country that's more developed,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.960]   more free, and so on.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.320]   And they managed to build a pretty excellent society,
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.480]   in my estimation, from that.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.000]   Countries like fascist Germany and Italy,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.040]   they managed to do horrendous things in Japan
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.020]   and horrendous things with that.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.660]   In the US, with national popular appeals,
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.300]   FDR was able to unite a nation
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.420]   to elevate ordinary working-class people
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.180]   into a position where they felt like
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.300]   they had a real stake in the country,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.480]   and I think did great things with the New Deal.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.420]   In Russia, of course, this language was used
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.980]   to trample upon individual rights
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   and to justify hardship and abuses
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.020]   of ordinary individual people
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.040]   in the name of a collective destiny.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.060]   A destiny, of course, that was just decided
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.980]   by the party in power and during the '30s and '40s
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.680]   by just Don himself, really.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.780]   Now, I think that that's really the case
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:35.420]   for making sure that we have a bedrock
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.060]   of civil rights and democracy.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.700]   And then on top of that, we can debate.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.180]   We can debate different national destinies.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.000]   We can debate different appeals,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.140]   different visions of the world.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.980]   But as long as people have a say
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.660]   in what sacrifices they're being asked to do,
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.620]   and as long as those sacrifices don't take away
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.340]   what's fundamentally ours, which is our life,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:03.340]   which is our basic rights.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.120]   - And voice, our voice.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.860]   So this complicated picture,
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.400]   because help me understand,
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.780]   you mentioned that social democracy
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.540]   is trying to have social policies
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.980]   within a capitalist system, in part,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.380]   but your vision, your hope for a social democracy
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.140]   is one that goes beyond that.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.180]   How do you give everybody a voice
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.820]   while not becoming the Soviet Union,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.500]   while not becoming where basically people are silenced
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.140]   either directly through violence
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.620]   or through the implied threat of violence
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.100]   and therefore fear?
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.420]   - So I think you need to limit the scope
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.900]   of where the state is and what the state can do
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.100]   and how the state functions, first of all.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.060]   Now, for me, social democracy was like the equivalent of,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.960]   I'll give a football analogy.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.000]   It was the equivalent of getting to the red zone
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.620]   and then kicking a field goal.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.820]   You'll take the three points,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.940]   but you would have rather got a touchdown.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.900]   And for me, socialism would be the touchdown.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.460]   It's not a separate, different playing field.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.660]   - Some people would say socialism would be an interception.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.800]   - Sure, sure.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.180]   No, and they would have the right to, again,
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.540]   to say that and to say we shouldn't go further.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.940]   - And most coaches would take the safe route, right?
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.940]   So you're going against the decision.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.740]   Anyway, I'll just take three points.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.620]   - But I understand, I understand.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.540]   So for you, the goal is full socialism.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.300]   - But I'll take the three points.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.540]   You know, it's a part of,
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.060]   I just wanna march down the field.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.180]   I want to get within scoring position.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   The reason why we should really move from this analogy,
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.580]   but the reason why I call myself a socialist
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.000]   is looking through history
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.060]   and these examples of social democracy,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.880]   you saw that they were able to give working class people
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.680]   lots of rights and income and power in their society.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.140]   But at the end of the day,
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.600]   capitalists still had the ultimate power,
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.880]   which is the ability to withhold investment.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.880]   So they could say in the late 1960s and early 70s,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.940]   listen, I was fine with this arrangement 10 years ago,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.260]   but now I feel like I'm gonna take my money
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.780]   and I'm gonna go move to a different country
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.540]   or I'm just gonna not invest
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.540]   because my workers are paid too much.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.560]   I'm still making money,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.980]   but I feel like I could be making more.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.620]   I need more of an upper hand, right?
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.840]   So their economic power
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.140]   is then challenging the democratic mandate
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.600]   of Swedish workers that were voting
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.180]   for the social democratic party
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.920]   and were behind this advance.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.820]   So to me, what socialism is in part
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.420]   is taking the means of production, right?
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.700]   Where this capitalist power is coming from
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.860]   and making it socially owned
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.300]   so that ordinary workers can control their workplaces,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.020]   can make investment decisions and so on.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.320]   Now, does that mean total state ownership of everything
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.480]   or a planned economy?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.680]   I don't think that makes any sense.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.280]   I think that we should live in a society
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.220]   in which markets are harnessed and regulated and so on.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.120]   My main problem is capitalist ownership
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.160]   in part on normative grounds,
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.680]   just because I think that it doesn't make sense
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.280]   that we celebrate democracy and all these other spheres,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.880]   but we have workplaces that are just treated like tyrannies.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.940]   And in part, because I think that ordinary workers
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.280]   would much prefer a system in which over time,
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.220]   they accrued shares and ownership
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.940]   where they got, in addition to base kind of wage,
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.160]   they got dividends from their firm being successful
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.820]   and that they figured out how to,
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.720]   large firms, they're not gonna be making
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.680]   day-to-day decisions by democratic vote, right?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.920]   But maybe you would elect representatives,
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.240]   elected managements once every year or two,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.360]   depending on your operating agreement and so on.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.820]   That's kind of my vision of a socialist society.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.860]   And this sounds, I hope, like agree or disagree,
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.800]   like it would not be a crazy leap into year zero, right?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.180]   That this could be maybe a way in which we could take
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.200]   a lot of what's existing in society,
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.120]   but then just add this on top.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.140]   But what it would mean is a society
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.720]   without a capitalist class.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.200]   This class hasn't been, individually, these people,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   haven't been taken to re-education camps or whatever else,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.340]   but they're just no longer in this position.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.080]   And they're now part of the economy in other ways.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.140]   They'll probably be the first set of highly competent
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.440]   technocrats and managers and so on.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.040]   They'll probably be very well compensated
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.240]   for their time and expertise and whatever else.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.640]   But to me, both the practical end of things,
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.840]   like taking away this ability to withhold investment
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.760]   and increasing our ability to democratically
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.140]   shape investment priorities and to continue down
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.920]   the road of social democracy and on normative grounds
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.080]   by kind of egalitarian belief that ordinary people
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.780]   should have more stake in their lives in the workplace,
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.680]   leads me beyond social democracy to socialism.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.480]   - So there's a tricky thing here.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   So in Ukraine especially, but in the Soviet Union,
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.620]   there's the Kulaks.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.680]   The possible trajectory of fighting for the beautiful
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.120]   message of respecting workers' rights
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   has this dynamic of making an enemy of the capitalist class,
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.240]   too easily making an enemy of the capitalist class
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.040]   with a central leader, populist leader,
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.460]   that says the rich and the powerful,
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.680]   they're taking advantage of you.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.800]   We need to remove them.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.640]   We need to put them in camps perhaps.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.120]   Not said explicitly until it happens.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.580]   It can happen overnight.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.080]   But just putting a giant pressure on that capitalist class,
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.740]   and again, the Stalin type figure takes hold.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:30.040]   So I'm trying to understand how the mechanism
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.020]   can prevent that.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.540]   And perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias here
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.260]   is I've been reading, I was gonna say too much,
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.840]   maybe not enough, but a lot about books like
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.860]   Stalin's War on Ukraine and just I've been reading
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.900]   a lot about the '30s and the '40s for personal reasons
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.500]   related to my travels in Ukraine and all that kind of stuff.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   So I have a little bit of a focus on the historical
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.720]   implementations of communism currently
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.620]   without kind of an updated view of all the possible
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.460]   future implementations.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.100]   So I just wanna lay that out there.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.400]   But I worry about the slippery slope
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.280]   into the authoritarian figure that takes the sexy message,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.380]   destroys everyone who's powerful in the name
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.860]   of the working class and then fucks
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.140]   the working class afterwards.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.980]   - So first of all, I think it's worth remembering
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.140]   that the socialist movement had different outcomes
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.340]   across Western Europe and Eastern Europe.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.820]   And in some of these countries in Western Europe,
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.020]   there wasn't actually democracy before the workers movement
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.140]   and before the socialist movement.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.560]   So the battle in Sweden, for instance,
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.040]   was about establishing political democracy,
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.180]   establishing true representation for workers.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.060]   And that's how the parties became popular.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.140]   Same thing in Germany too.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.820]   Then it was the social Democrats who were able
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.000]   to build political democracy.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.620]   Then on top of that, add layers of economic democracy,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.480]   social democracy.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.700]   The Swedish social Democrats ruled basically uninterrupted
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.700]   from the early 1930s until 1976.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.020]   It's kind of crazy to think about,
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.180]   but they were just in government.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.720]   They were the leading member of government.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.240]   But a few different coalition partners would shift.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.800]   Sometimes they were with their agrarians.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.620]   Sometimes they were with the communists briefly,
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.720]   but they ruled uninterrupted.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.480]   And they lost an election in 1976 and they just left power.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.400]   Then they got back into power in the 80s.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.920]   So in other words, they created a democratic system,
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.820]   of course, with mass support of working class people.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.720]   Then they truly honored the system
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.420]   because when they lost power, they lost power.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.960]   They left power.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.520]   There's plenty of cases like that across Europe
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.560]   and the world and in other countries like Korea
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.440]   and elsewhere where the workers movements,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.320]   the most militant, the most class centric workers,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.420]   South Africa is the same way, created democratic systems.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.600]   Now, Russia, I think a lot of what happened had to do
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.520]   with the fact that it was never a democratic country.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.320]   It was ruled by a party and the party itself was very easy
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.360]   to shift from a somewhat democratic party in Lenin's day
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.080]   to an authoritarian one in Russia.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.440]   And there was no distinction then
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.960]   between the party and the state.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.240]   So your authoritarian party then became authoritarian
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.260]   total control over the entirety of the state.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.000]   Now, the fact that the Soviet system involved
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.400]   total state ownership of production meant
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.360]   that the authoritarianism of the party state
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.440]   could go even deeper into the lives of ordinary people
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.080]   compared to other horrific dictatorships
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.120]   like Pinochet's Chile and so on,
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.880]   when maybe you could find some solace just at home
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.600]   or whatever else, you didn't have the same sort
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   of totalitarian control of people's lives.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.320]   But I would say that socialism itself
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.400]   has yielded different outcomes.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.840]   Now, on the question of polarization,
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.160]   I guess that implies that this polarization,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.760]   this distinction is a distinction that isn't real
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   in society and that is kind of being manufactured,
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.600]   generated.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   - You mean the capitalist class and the working class
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.440]   just to clarify?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.260]   Yeah, okay.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.760]   - So in certain populist distinctions,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   the division is basically arbitrary or made up,
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.080]   the us versus them polarization,
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.160]   depending who the us and who the them are.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   You know, it's truly something that's manufactured.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.000]   But capitalism itself as a system,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.440]   as a system based on class division,
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.960]   whether you're a supporter or opposite,
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.260]   I think we should acknowledge it's based on class division,
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.800]   that is the thing creating that polarization.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   Now, I think what a lot of what socialists try to do
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   is we try to take bits of working class opposition
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.440]   to capitalism, to their lives,
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.280]   to the way they're treated at work and so on.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.480]   And yes, we do try to organize on those bases
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.720]   to help workers take collective action,
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.600]   to help them organize in political parties and so on,
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.320]   to represent their interests, economic and otherwise.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.280]   But the contradiction exists to begin with.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.360]   And if anything, this system,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.120]   which I'm proposing, democratic socialism,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.360]   would be kind of a resolution of this conflict,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.520]   this dilemma, this thing that has always existed
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.560]   since Chieftain and follower and so on.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.200]   We've had class division since the Neolithic Revolution.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.640]   You know, I think this is a democratic road
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.080]   out of that tension and that division of humanity
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.480]   into people who own and people have nothing to give
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.000]   but their ability to work.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.280]   - So that idea is grounded in,
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.540]   going all the way back to Marx,
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.700]   that all of human history can be told
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.440]   through the lens of class struggle.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.000]   Is there some sense, can you still man the case
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.320]   that this class difference is over-exaggerated?
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.720]   That there's a difference,
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.640]   but it's not the difference of the abuser and the abused.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   It's more of a difference of people that were successful
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.680]   and people that were less successful.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.080]   - So I'll play devil's advocate,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.720]   which is that maybe one could argue
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.560]   that in its purest, earliest stage,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.360]   capitalism was based on a stark difference.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.720]   But then since then, two things have happened.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.760]   One, a bunch of socialists and workers have organized
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   to guarantee certain rights for working class people,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.160]   certain protections.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.880]   So in our system now, there are certain safety nets,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.400]   less in the US than in other countries,
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   but in a lot of countries,
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.000]   there are pretty extensive safety nets.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.840]   - Even like 40-hour work week, minimum wage,
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.360]   safety regulations, all that kind of stuff.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.600]   - And all those things are, in my mind,
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.440]   doses of socialism within capitalism,
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.520]   'cause what you're doing is you are taking the autonomy
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.240]   of capitalists to do whatever they want
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.000]   with the people contracted to them.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.080]   And the only thing stopping them is them potentially
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.160]   being able to go to another employer,
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.480]   but even then, it's kind of potentially a race
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.320]   to the bottom.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.200]   If you can't get more than $2 an hour
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.040]   from any employer in your market,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.400]   you're gonna have to live with it.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.520]   So one factor is we have built in those protections.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.840]   So we've taken enough socialism into capitalism
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.320]   that you could say that at a certain point,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.400]   maybe it makes a qualitative difference
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.120]   and not just a quantitative difference in people's lives.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.280]   The other thing is over time, we've gotten wealthier
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.960]   and more productive as a society.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.440]   So maybe at some point, the quantitative difference
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.480]   of just more and more wealth means that even if,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.920]   in the abstract, the division between a worker
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.120]   and a capitalist is real, if that worker is earning
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.800]   a quarter million dollars a year and has a good life
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.760]   and only has to clock in 35 hours a week, 30 hours a week,
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.560]   and has four weeks of vacation,
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   then isn't it just an abstract or philosophical difference?
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.920]   So I think you could level those two arguments.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.200]   What I would say is that, one,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.720]   a lot of these rights that we have fought for
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.920]   are constantly being eroded and they're under attack,
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.160]   in part because the economic power that capitalists have
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.600]   bleeds into our political democracy as well.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.680]   There's constant lobbying for all sorts
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:45.280]   of labor market deregulations and so on.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.720]   I fundamentally believe that if tomorrow
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.880]   all those regulations went away,
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.640]   capitalists would fight to pay people as little as possible
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.680]   and we'd be back in 19th century capitalism.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.640]   And not because they're bad people,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.320]   because if I'm running a firm and all of a sudden
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.040]   my competition is able to find a labor pool
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.320]   and is paying people less than me,
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.240]   I'm gonna be undercut 'cause they'll be able to take
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.000]   some of that extra savings and invest into new technology
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.680]   or whatever else and they'll gobble up my market share
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.000]   before long.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.960]   And then also beyond that,
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.920]   I do think there's a normative question here,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   which is, now, do we believe that ordinary people
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.880]   have a capacity to be able to make certain decisions
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.720]   about their work?
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   Do we believe they know more about their work
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.360]   than their bosses?
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.200]   Now, I don't think that's natural at every level,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   but I think there's no doubt that in workplaces,
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   workers know how to productively do their task
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.040]   in ways that their manager might not know.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.520]   I think we've all been in workplaces
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.120]   where we've had managers who kind of don't know
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.680]   what you do or whatever else.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.880]   And I think that collectively, if incentivized,
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.680]   we could have them, one, instead of hoarding
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.280]   more of that information, since they're getting a stake
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.960]   in production and so on, they'd be able to more freely
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   share it and be able to reshape how their day-to-day work
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.200]   happens.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.120]   And also with elected managers,
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.640]   you kind of take that up the chain,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.920]   I think you would have perfectly efficient
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   market-based firms that could exist without capitalists.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:36.080]   - So there's a, I mean, there's a lot of things to say,
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.360]   maybe within just very, very low level question
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.760]   of if the workers are running the show,
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.720]   there's a brutal truth to the fact that some people
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.360]   are better, and the workers know this,
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.040]   it's the Steve Jobs A players,
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.280]   you want to have all the A players in the room,
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.320]   'cause one B player can poison the pool,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.680]   'cause then everybody gets demotivated by,
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:06.440]   by the nature of that lack of excellence and competence.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.640]   This is just to take sort of a crude
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.400]   devil's advocate perspective.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.120]   Are the workers going to be able to remove
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.320]   the incompetent from the pool in the name,
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.080]   in the goal of, towards the mission of succeeding
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.400]   as a collective?
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.800]   - So I think that any successful model of socialism
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.080]   that involves the market, you need two things.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.120]   One is at the micro level, you need the ability
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.520]   to fire people and for them to exit firms,
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.200]   which might be a slower process in cooperative based firms
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.720]   than it is in a capitalist firm without a union,
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.440]   but it would be probably akin to the process
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.240]   that would happen in a capitalist firm
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.000]   of which there are many with unions.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.280]   So you need that, and then at the macro level,
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.720]   you need firm failure.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.120]   You need to avoid a dilemma that happened
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   in Soviet style economies, which was soft budget,
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:07.000]   you know, constraints and firms basically
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.720]   not being allowed to fail because the government
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.080]   was committed to full employment,
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.480]   the firms employed people.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.800]   So even inefficient firms were at the end of the day,
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.920]   they knew they were going to be propped up
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.680]   by the government and they would be given
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.080]   all the resources they would need,
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.320]   no matter how inefficiently they were using those resources
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.640]   to maintain employment.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.120]   So I think you need both.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.360]   - Do you worry about this idea of firing people?
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.960]   Man, I'm uncomfortable with the idea, I hate it,
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.600]   but I also know it's extremely necessary.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.000]   So is there something about a collective,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.080]   a socialist system that makes firing,
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.840]   you said it might be slower, might it become extremely slow?
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.400]   Too much friction?
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   Isn't there a tension between respecting the rights
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   of a human being and saying, like, you need to step up,
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.760]   maybe sort of deposit the care, like, you really,
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.080]   like, to really encourage fellow workers, no,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.120]   when there's a person that's not pulling their side
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.240]   of the, doing as great of a job as they could be.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.040]   But isn't the person that's not doing a great of a job
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.920]   going to start to manipulate the system
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.880]   that slows the firing in their self-interest?
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.360]   - Well, I think there would be certain,
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.600]   so maybe another way to put it is,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.360]   think about like if you're a partner at a law firm, right?
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.840]   I don't really know how law firms work,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.440]   so I probably shouldn't use this analogy,
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.800]   but correct me if I'm wrong, but let's say you're a partner,
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.640]   you kind of have equity in your law firm
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.320]   or something beyond your billable hours,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.880]   and let's say you're going to be fired from your law firm
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.000]   or they're laying off people or whatever else,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.720]   they could just get rid of you,
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.080]   but they would also have to figure out
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.840]   how to kind of buy you out too after a certain point.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.720]   So I think that like in a cooperative firm,
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.640]   you'd probably have a system where you,
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.720]   after a certain point of working productively,
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.640]   you probably have a period
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.560]   where you get fired really quickly, no matter what,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.200]   but once your job security kicks in,
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.000]   you would be able to, it would be a process.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.640]   It would probably be like a day or two process
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.480]   to figure it out,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.360]   or maybe they would have a progressive discipline process,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   which is first you have to get a verbal feedback,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.760]   and then maybe a written performance review,
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.800]   then you could be fired.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.760]   I mean, that's how it works in a lot of workplaces
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.920]   with either unions or with just basic job security.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.480]   Most countries, that's how it works,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.040]   'cause there's not at-will employment in most countries.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   So I think that the real tension is if you fire someone,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.960]   if you're condemning them to destitution,
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.560]   then morally you would really feel something there,
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.160]   as you should as a human being
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.240]   concerned about other people,
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.920]   but in a social system
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.680]   or even basic social democratic system,
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.240]   there'd be mechanisms to take care of that person.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.360]   So one, if a firm is failing for any reason,
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.000]   they're getting out-compete or whatever else,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.120]   those workers would then land in the hands,
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.240]   just for a little bit, of the state, right?
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.000]   And there could be active labor market policies
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.160]   to retrain people to go into expanding sectors,
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.600]   or your sector is now obsolete,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.320]   but here, you have these skills,
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.960]   you're gonna be trained,
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.600]   and here are some resources
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.000]   to kind of help you along your training,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.360]   and then there's a bunch of firms hiring,
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.200]   so go on your way.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.560]   Then also just with an expanded welfare state,
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.800]   being destitute in certain countries,
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.560]   being unemployed in certain countries,
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.680]   is easier than in other countries or situations.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.680]   So you still can fall back on that mechanism,
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:46.800]   and also my vision of market socialism,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   a democratic socialism,
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.080]   there would be an expanded state sector.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.400]   Not anything you can imagine,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.520]   but the way in which there's more of a state sector
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   in countries like Norway or Denmark
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.760]   than there is in the US.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.480]   So there would be various forms of state employment
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.000]   and whatever else.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.280]   So I mean, I think that the real question is,
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.920]   should being bad at your job,
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.320]   or getting fired for any reason,
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.440]   or getting laid off,
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.200]   should that be a cause to have you totally lose your shirt,
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.800]   or maybe should you just have to rebound,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.360]   maybe you have less money for consumption,
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.320]   or whatever else,
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.960]   and you'll be on your way onto bigger and better things
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.840]   in a few months.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.400]   - So a strong social net,
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.960]   in many ways, make it more efficient
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.880]   to fire people who are not good at their job,
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.640]   because then they won't be,
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.400]   that won't actually significantly damage
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.240]   their quality of life,
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.760]   and they have a chance to find a job
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.360]   at which they can flourish.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.720]   - Sure. - Right.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.640]   To step out into the macro,
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.760]   there's a tension here as well.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.200]   So you said that there's inequality between the classes,
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.360]   the capitalist class and the working class,
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.920]   and sort of, there's a lot of ways
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.560]   you can maybe correct me on the numbers,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.200]   but you could say that the top 1% of Americans
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.440]   have more wealth than the bottom 50%.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.240]   That's not talking about perhaps capitalist class
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.360]   and the working class,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.120]   but it's a good sort of estimate, right?
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.040]   The flip side of that,
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.480]   if you just look at countries
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.280]   that have more economic freedom
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.200]   versus less economic freedom,
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.920]   more capitalism versus less capitalism,
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.560]   their GDP seems to be significantly higher.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.920]   And so at the local level,
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.800]   you might say that there's an inequality,
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.040]   but if you look historically over decades,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.920]   it seems like the more capitalism there is,
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.720]   the higher the GDP grows,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.920]   and therefore the level of the quality of life
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.320]   and the basic income, the basic wealth,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.480]   the average, even including the working class,
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.240]   goes up over time.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.720]   Can you see both sides of this?
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.360]   - So I could definitely accept some of that premise.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.120]   One, within capitalism, right,
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.920]   you want a bigger pie.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.720]   And then if you divide up that pie,
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.080]   even if the bottom 10% of the working class share,
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.000]   let's say is less as a percentage,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.760]   it's still more in raw terms.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.600]   So it's better for everyone.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.960]   The part that I would dispute
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.320]   is more economic freedom versus less economic freedom.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.760]   So there's obviously some countries
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.080]   in which capitalism doesn't work,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.360]   and maybe economic freedom plays a role.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.720]   Like if you're in a country like Egypt or India
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.600]   with a highly, or previously highly bureaucratic system,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.560]   so you need to get licenses to do anything,
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.680]   and you need to run things for the state,
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.200]   or you need to bribe someone to get an incorporation done,
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.440]   or whatever else,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.800]   that's in case in which I would accept the premise of,
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.080]   okay, economic freedom to take entrepreneurial risk
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.800]   to start something new is limited.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.760]   There's all sorts of factors in which it's too difficult
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:11.560]   to start a firm, and it benefits no one really,
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.640]   except for whatever bureaucracy might be,
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.000]   might be taking their 15% cut.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.280]   But in general, I think in advanced economies,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.040]   it doesn't really work that way.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.400]   So think about it this way.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.600]   If you're, pretend like we're back,
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.200]   I'm sorry to go to Scandinavia again,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.760]   but this is a good example.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.440]   Let's say you're back in the 1970s
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.280]   in Scandinavia or whatever else.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.800]   You're in a country with extremely powerful unions.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.480]   So the unions have a lot of labor rights,
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.720]   the state has certain high taxation,
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.800]   certain guarantees on you too,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.720]   but you're a capitalist there.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:59.480]   Now, what would you do if your capitalist competitors
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   in the US were able to pay workers $10 an hour,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.560]   and you have to pay them 20?
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.320]   You would probably,
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.280]   and assuming you can't just flee or shut down
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.400]   or whatever else,
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.760]   you'd probably find ways to use labor saving technology.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.040]   That power of the high wages
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.680]   might encourage you to invest more in technology
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.400]   and to utilize people's times better
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.800]   so they're more productive at work.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.080]   So they're not just like sitting around or whatever else.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.440]   So this really happened in practice
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.200]   in the Scandinavian countries,
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.800]   in part 'cause it was combined with a certain type
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.160]   of pattern wage bargaining.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.080]   So I'll explain this really simply,
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.520]   but let's pretend that you're in a sector
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.480]   with three different companies.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.600]   I would say on automotive sector,
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   and I'll just say one is GM, one is Ford, one is Chrysler.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.800]   Now, all these workers in your sector are all unionized.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.080]   They're all Swedish UAW, whatever the equivalent is,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.800]   members, and they're all paid the same.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.560]   And the union is setting through bargaining,
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.760]   the union is setting the wages across the sector.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.560]   But the unions, and let's say GM is the most productive
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.000]   of these companies, Ford is number two,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.320]   Chrysler is number three.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.400]   The unions would intentionally set the wages,
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.920]   set their benchmark to Ford in the middle.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.720]   So what that would do is say to Ford,
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.120]   okay, Ford will stay in business
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.360]   'cause they'll be able to meet the wage demands.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.240]   Chrysler's probably might go out of business
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.160]   because they won't be able to meet the demands
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.720]   or they'll have to really adapt really quickly.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.760]   They might have to lay off people,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.000]   they might have to restructure.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.560]   So union knows this in advance
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.320]   and all the auto workers know this.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.560]   But the most efficient manufacturer, GM,
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.800]   now has excess profits
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.160]   because if they were negotiating with just the GM workers,
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.280]   the GM workers might even have been able to demand more,
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.200]   but instead these workers are pegging their wage demands
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.600]   to Ford's level and GM is in theory able to expand
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.880]   and employ more people
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.800]   and adopt new production techniques with their surplus.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.120]   Then those Chrysler workers would be absorbed by the state
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.200]   by active labor market policies,
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.680]   then put back to work for GM
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.320]   or for these expanding sectors.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.080]   So in other words, you're now in a situation
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.520]   where the state has a pretty big role in your economy,
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.440]   taking a lot of your money and taxes.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   Unions are really shaping your life as a capitalist
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.480]   far more than would happen in a country
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.760]   like the United States.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.280]   And yet still, despite your more limited economic freedom,
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.520]   you're still creating a more productive economy.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.360]   So it could work.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.920]   It just has, the system has to be designed right.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.480]   And I think social democracies were designed the right way.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.320]   I think any future democratic socialism
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.800]   after social democracy would have to be designed
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.720]   the right way.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.080]   - Could you just linger on that a little more,
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.960]   the pattern wage bargaining?
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   So GM is the most efficient and Ford is the second most.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.640]   Can you explain to me how, can you explain to me again,
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.840]   the wages, setting the wages to the Ford level,
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.640]   how that is good for GM?
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.280]   - So-
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.760]   - How that encourages more GM?
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.120]   - This is just sectoral or actually in this case,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.640]   centralized wage bargaining.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   So setting the wages at a level that Ford can afford,
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.280]   but a level that would probably be too expensive
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.320]   for Chrysler in the automotive sector would benefit GM
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   because they're drawing what we could call excess profits.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.920]   Because GM, if the GM itself could potentially
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.400]   have to deal with just the enterprise of GM workers,
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.680]   bargaining for wages.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.000]   And if they saw their profitability was high,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.680]   they would know their leverage and they would say,
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.720]   "Pay us even more or else we're gonna go on strike."
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.560]   But instead they're accepting slightly lower wages
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.240]   than they would have otherwise had in return
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.580]   for the company having excess profits,
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.520]   that they're through both the state, their union,
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.160]   and sometimes like there's worker councils
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.400]   or whatever else.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.160]   They're playing a role in saying,
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.760]   "Okay, we're gonna make sure this excess profit
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.840]   is actually invested productively
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.840]   in order to expand employment and just output."
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.320]   - Okay, can we talk about unions in general then?
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.480]   What are the pros and cons of unions?
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.240]   So the interest of the union,
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.040]   maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.760]   I have a lot to learn both about the economics
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.200]   and the human experience of a union.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.160]   The union's interest is to,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.520]   what, to protect worker rights
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.020]   and to maximize worker happiness,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.720]   not the success and the productivity
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.840]   and the efficiency of a company, right?
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.800]   - No, I would disagree.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.400]   So I think a union's interest is in
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.440]   what's collectively bargaining on behalf of workers.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.880]   Because in certain cases,
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:38.040]   I am right now a manager at The Nation magazine, right?
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.320]   If I have a problem with my working conditions
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.440]   or I need a raise or whatever else,
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.920]   I could with my skillset, my background,
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.160]   my role in the company, I could go to my boss,
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.640]   the owner of The Nation and say,
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.800]   "Okay, I need to renegotiate my contract on these terms."
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.440]   I could bargain, right?
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.440]   Now, if I was a ordinary worker at like a CVS or something,
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.560]   if I didn't like my conditions and I went to my boss
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.720]   and said, "Hey, I need a $2 raise
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.160]   and I need to be home by 8.30
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.680]   'cause I have obligations at home,"
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.660]   the boss would probably say,
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.200]   "I'm sorry, that's not possible, right?
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.440]   Maybe try the Rite Aid down the street
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.740]   or the Walgreens down the street or whatever."
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.600]   Now, if I went to the boss at a place like CVS
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.240]   or even better, if all the pharmaceutical workers
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.000]   at Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens went to our bosses and said,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.800]   "Listen, we collectively need to,
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:51.000]   $2 more and better hours, shorter shifts,"
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.200]   or whatever else,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.980]   then they would probably have no choice but to concede.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.200]   You have to bargain collectively at any level
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.040]   if you're an ordinary worker.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.520]   And there are some exceptions,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.460]   but that's for certain highly skilled workers.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.280]   But even in those cases, of course, all workers are skilled.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.180]   I mean, just the technical definition.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.680]   Even in those cases, a lot of those workers
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.960]   have to bargain collectively as well
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.440]   in order to get more wealth.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.340]   But they cannot make their demands so excessive
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.260]   that their firm gets out of business.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.380]   So the workers only are workers
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.620]   as long as they're gainfully employed.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:37.620]   So often unions will try to select their wage demands
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.900]   at such a level that it ensures
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.180]   that their firm will stay in business.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.900]   - Yeah, but the problem is the way firms go out of business
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.380]   isn't by an explosion,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.440]   like the way popcorn starts getting cooked.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.040]   At a certain moment, it just is over.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.880]   It seems like the union can,
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.240]   through collective bargaining, keep increasing the wage,
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.720]   keep increasing the interest of the worker
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.420]   until it suffocates the company,
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:09.680]   that it doesn't die immediately,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.100]   but it dies in like five years.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.840]   So that might still serve the interest of the worker,
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.180]   but it doesn't serve the interest of society as a whole
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.880]   that's creating cool stuff.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.660]   A market that's operating and increasing cool stuff
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.100]   and constantly innovating and so on,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.100]   and creating more and more cool stuff
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.440]   and increasing the quality of life in general.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.720]   - I disagree with the premise,
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.800]   because I think even taking your example,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.900]   that would be better for society.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.760]   If a firm cannot pay its workers a living wage,
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.200]   but its competitors can,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.840]   then that firm will either figure out a way to innovate,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.180]   develop new techniques, new markets,
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:53.380]   new ways to be productive, or it should go out of business.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:56.380]   And it would be better for it to go out of business
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.940]   than to stay in business
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:01.580]   or to be artificially kept in business in any sort of way.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.820]   That's the Chrysler, my old centralized bargaining.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:12.020]   - Right, but then there is, innovation costs money too.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.020]   So the flip side of that,
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.260]   I think to play devil's advocate,
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.900]   is that it incentivizes, automotive industry
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.800]   is probably a good example of that.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.080]   It incentivizes cutting costs everywhere
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.780]   and sort of whatever has been making you money currently,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.540]   figuring out how to do that really well
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.120]   without investing into the long-term future of the company
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.420]   for all the different ways it can pivot,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.340]   all the different interesting things it could do
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.120]   in terms of investing into R&D.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.200]   Whenever there's more and more and more pressure
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.800]   on paying a living wage for the workers,
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.640]   it might not, again, it might suffocate and die
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.960]   over the next five, 10, 20 years,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.980]   which might be a good destructive force
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.800]   from a capitalist perspective,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.160]   but it might rob us of the Einstein of a company, right?
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.560]   Of the flourishing that the company
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.280]   and the workers within it can do
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.320]   over a period of five, 10, 20 years.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.960]   - Well, this is just a problem with a lot of capitalism,
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.120]   which is about short-termism, right?
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.560]   'Cause the same thing could be said
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.280]   from you're starting a company,
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.440]   you have a plan for it to make a lot of money,
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.700]   but your investors want dividends right away.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.700]   So you have to take away from your long-term R&D
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.980]   or other plans and deliver short-term dividends.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:37.000]   That's often why a lot of, I think, R&D
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.320]   is often rooted in state institutions and research
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.680]   and whatever else is being drawed on.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.880]   And also I think that that's a reason why
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.240]   the state has some sort of role in fostering firms
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.800]   in either my version of a socialist economy
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.000]   or a capitalist economy or whatever else
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.840]   to help with these time horizon problems.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.240]   So I won't dispute that workers could play a role
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.700]   or wage demands could play a role in time horizon problems,
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.400]   but more often than that, it's coming from investors,
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.520]   it's coming from just a host of other market pressures
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.360]   that people might have.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.280]   And I would say that in the real world,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.200]   a lot of investment funds don't come
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.840]   from just retained earnings,
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.080]   it comes from a lot of sources.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.680]   So I think this is a problem that could be solved
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.080]   through public policy, but definitely exists today as well.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.300]   - So you mentioned living wage.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:36.440]   Is there a tension between a living wage,
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.360]   and maybe you could speak to what a living wage means,
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.340]   and the workers owning all of the profit of the company?
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.600]   Sort of this kind of spectrum.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   No, I guess the spectrum is from like no minimum wage,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.120]   the lowest possible thing you could pay to a worker,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.980]   then somewhere in that spectrum is a living wage,
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.680]   and then at the top is like all of the profit
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.720]   from the company is owned by the workers.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.280]   So split to the workers.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.040]   - I mean, I think that any society
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.900]   is going to have to make distributional choices.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.880]   You could have, imagine a variety of capitalism
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.120]   in which workers are paid quite little,
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.480]   but there's extremely high taxation,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.200]   and there's redistribution after the fact.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.120]   You can imagine a system in which
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.080]   there's less taxation after the fact,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.040]   but there's more guarantees and regulations
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.600]   on how much people are paid before the fact.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.060]   In my vision of a socialist society,
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.280]   there would be some other way that unions work,
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.000]   and in my example, the centralized bargaining unions
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.600]   would work that bargain at the sectoral level,
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.240]   and not just at the enterprise level
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.440]   like our unions do today.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.540]   There could be benchmarks set
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.840]   for different occupations or wages.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.520]   And the reason why you would want a benchmark
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.600]   at a worker-controlled firm
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.920]   is that you don't want workers self-exploiting themselves
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.220]   in order to gobble up market share,
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.740]   or because you don't want them collectively deciding,
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.940]   "Okay, we're gonna invest in this longer-term time horizon,
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.940]   "and out-compete other people that way."
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.460]   So you might say, "Okay, if you do this sort of
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.680]   "clerical work, you have to be paid
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.020]   "the equivalent of $15 an hour, and that's minimum,
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:29.020]   "but on top of that, you get dividends from excess profits."
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:34.040]   And I think it would also have to be combined
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   with public financing for expansions and for development,
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.500]   which could be done in quite a competitive way.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   So you could have a variety of banks.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.700]   My vision, state-owned banks,
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:53.260]   but how would they decide who to invest in
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.380]   and who to not invest in,
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.860]   who to give a loan for expansion to and who not to?
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.840]   'Cause you don't want it to be like,
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.660]   "Oh, I'm gonna invest in my nephew's firm,
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.900]   "and not this other firm,"
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.360]   or, "I'm gonna invest in this guy's firm
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.740]   "because he's an Italian, but not this guy's firm
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.220]   "'cause he's Albanian," or whatever else.
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.260]   Just make it rational at the level of their goal
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:19.260]   is just like any other investment person at a bank today
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.900]   to maintain a certain risk profile
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.620]   and to have an interest yield,
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.140]   and decide to invest on that basis.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.180]   So if there's a huge automotive firm
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.140]   that has been in business for 50 years
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.820]   that needs a little operating cash,
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.340]   like, yeah, they could get their $50 million,
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.620]   their 3% loan.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.700]   If you have some crazy blue sky idea
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.820]   and you managed to get it to that point,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.620]   like maybe you and your friends would get it at 12%
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:47.880]   or something close to what a VC would offer today.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.820]   So I only kind of go into these details,
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:54.820]   not because to say that a system doesn't have to,
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:59.420]   in advance, map out all the different possibilities,
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.300]   but I think it does have to be willing to accept
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.580]   a lot of things that we know today.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.540]   I can't give you a version of socialism
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.580]   that everything's gonna be fine,
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.220]   we're gonna live harmoniously,
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.420]   and we won't have these sort of tensions,
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:16.100]   and you could hunt in the evening
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.740]   and fish in the afternoon and write criticism,
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.300]   or whatever else.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.700]   I do hope that there's horizons beyond this
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.920]   that we could aspire to.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.980]   I do have those visions,
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.140]   but for now I think our task as socialists
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:36.340]   is to imagine five minutes after midnight,
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:41.580]   what can we do right away within our lifetime vision?
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.860]   - So that means through some level of central planning,
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.020]   reallocating resources to the workers.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.620]   - So I think the primary mechanism
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.900]   in this private sector under socialism
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.380]   would be a market mechanism,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.100]   firms competing against each other to expand,
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.580]   connected to a system of public financing.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:03.940]   But even at that level,
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:08.500]   the individual bankers and public banks and so on
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.900]   would be operating based on their own rationality,
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:16.440]   and the state would certainly shape investment decisions,
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.180]   but maybe no more than they do
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.820]   in a lot of capitalist systems.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.820]   So the state might, already today,
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.940]   in a lot of countries decide,
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.300]   we wanna invest in green technology,
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.180]   so it's gonna be favorable rates for people
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.780]   or tax credits for people investing in green technology.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.380]   So the state already shapes investment.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.060]   I think what should be centrally planned,
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.480]   and this is where I'm proud to sound
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.700]   like an old school socialist,
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.740]   is things like healthcare,
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.340]   things like transit,
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:50.260]   things like our natural monopolies of lots of types,
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:54.280]   I think can be done very well through planning,
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.460]   and we already have plenty of examples,
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.340]   but a lot of this society, I think,
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.300]   would be the private sphere
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.420]   of worker-controlled cooperatives
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.860]   competing against each other,
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:09.420]   weak firms failing, successful firms expanded.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.180]   - And the banks, you're saying publicly or privately owned?
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.180]   - Publicly owned.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.660]   - Let's just put it all on the table
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.660]   that it's almost guaranteed that every system has corruption.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.900]   So I guess the bigger question is,
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.820]   which system has more corruption?
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.080]   This one with central planning and worker cooperatives
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.200]   versus unfettered capitalism,
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.360]   or any flavor of capitalism.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.760]   - I think any system has potential for corruption.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.720]   I think it depends on how good your civil service is,
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.480]   how much oversight do you have
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.800]   to resolve a problem once it arises.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.680]   - How does corruption happen in a socialist system?
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.820]   So you have to, again, I apologize,
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.080]   but the large-scale examples of it,
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.820]   so we can look at Soviet Union, China, and Sweden,
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:00.660]   fundamentally different nations and histories
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:04.120]   and peoples and economic systems and political systems,
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:09.040]   but all could be called in part socialist.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:13.200]   And so what, you know, there's a ridiculous,
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.560]   almost caricature of corruption in the Soviet system,
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.680]   the gigantic bureaucracy that's built,
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.280]   where somehow corruption seeps in
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.360]   through kind of dispersion of responsibility,
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.200]   that nobody's really responsible for the corruption.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.520]   I just had a conversation with Ed Calderon,
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.600]   who fought the cartels in Mexico,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.240]   and there is a huge amount of corruption in Mexico,
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.440]   but it's not like even seen as corruption.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.320]   You understand when a cop pulls you over,
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.480]   you give this much money, and so on.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.360]   And so that kind of seems to happen in certain systems,
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.000]   and it seems to have happened in socialist systems
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.280]   more than in capitalist systems in the 20th century.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.640]   Or maybe I'm wrong on that.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.120]   - No, I mean, I think in a lot of countries,
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.000]   it's seen as the cost of doing business, right?
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.040]   Now, in particular countries built on a system
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.120]   of central planning, or just state allocation of resources,
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.040]   where the state both produces and allocates
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.480]   and things run through bureaucracies,
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.160]   then I think you're much more apt to have corruption
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.800]   than in a system with just a smaller sphere for the state.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.960]   So for example, if you're in a hypothetical version
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.120]   of the US, you might see a lot more corruption
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.440]   in like the post office, but you wouldn't have
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.080]   that corruption in your workplace,
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.320]   so you kind of learn to go around that.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.280]   For one thing, even in state sectors, you can have,
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.920]   and this often is the case in democratic countries,
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.920]   you have a transparent civil service,
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.960]   where people who are corrupt are prosecuted by judges,
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.920]   where it's frowned upon, and it just,
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.840]   over time, it goes away.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.920]   So you go from having political machines
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.000]   that were tied to certain, had friends
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.840]   in certain police precincts and whatever else in the US
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.120]   in the 19th century and early 20th century,
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.960]   to now today, that would be a huge scandal
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.120]   and unheard of, right?
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   So I think over time, having a independent court system,
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.120]   having a truly meritocratic civil service
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.080]   can be implemented anywhere.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.600]   I think though, in the Soviet Union,
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.400]   the extra little bit that happened was,
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.880]   you had a bureaucracy that just had so much power
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.840]   because the bureaucracy was producing
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.000]   and distributing everything, and everyone was relying
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.640]   on the bureaucracy with jobs.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.920]   The way to social advancement was through the bureaucracies,
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.480]   so you end up with people like Khrushchev,
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.920]   people going from peasants to supreme leaders of countries
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.840]   just through getting hooked up in the bureaucracy
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.040]   and advancing within it.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.440]   And not all of these were bad people.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.000]   I don't think Khrushchev was that bad of a person,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.680]   or Gorbachev, but this is their mechanism
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.920]   to advancement in systems like this.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.440]   In the vision of democratic socialism that I propose,
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.120]   the state doesn't have that overriding power to begin with,
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.360]   but I think in either case,
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.760]   corruption has arose in many different systems
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.000]   and has been successfully dealt with.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.160]   I think on the developmental trajectory
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.960]   of even countries today that we think of
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.960]   as being very corrupt, corruption will fade away as well.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:33.080]   But you definitely need a system in which individuals act,
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:38.600]   individuals are incentivized to act rationally.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:43.000]   So if you're in a system in which cops who are corrupt
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.720]   are prosecuted and investigated,
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.760]   and there's internal controls, a civilian board review,
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.040]   and kind of an internal investigators
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.160]   within police departments or whatever else,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.520]   there will be less corruption over time
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.680]   if people are punished.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.840]   If you're in a system in which if you're running a firm
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.920]   or you're the manager of a firm, an elected manager,
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.600]   and everyone at that firm is trying for more efficiency
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.920]   and trying for more excess profits
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.600]   or whatever else at the end of the day,
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.160]   dividends at the end of the day,
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.840]   then if you try to hire your nephew
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.320]   and he's not good at your job,
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.840]   you're not gonna win re-election, right?
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.760]   So you shouldn't, I think no system should rely on
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.560]   a change in culture that come naturally
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.240]   or some sort of individual altruism.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.440]   I think the systems have to be constructed
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.080]   in such a way that it's not rational to behave poorly.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.760]   - In sort of from a theoretical perspective,
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.680]   either a socialist or capitalist system
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.860]   can have either culture.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:47.800]   But it seems like if you prioritize meritocracy,
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.120]   if the people that are good, whatever the good means,
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.360]   in terms of integrity, in terms of performance,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.960]   in terms of competence,
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.160]   it seems like that leads to a less corrupt system.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.360]   And it seems like capitalism,
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.480]   there's all kinds of flavors of capitalism,
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.120]   but capitalism, because it does prioritize meritocracy,
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.720]   more often leads to less corruption.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   So that's not a question of political or economic systems,
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.840]   it's a question of what kind of stuff do you talk about
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.800]   that leads to a culture of less corruption?
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.680]   - First of all, I think in theory,
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.760]   maybe capitalism rewards meritocracy,
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.440]   but I think in practice, anyone watching this,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.760]   or you and me, would think of some of the people we know
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.320]   that work the hardest, and they're often working class
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.120]   people working in the food service industry
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.320]   or whatever else, right?
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.840]   I think we don't have, in practice,
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.600]   I don't think we actually live in a society
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   that rewards people for hard work.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.240]   I think we reward people for a combination
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.320]   of accidents of birth plus hard work.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.040]   - Let me push back, because yes, so I agree with you,
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.600]   but let me push back on a subtle point,
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.360]   because I like to draw a difference
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.280]   between hard work and meritocracy,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.960]   because as a person who works really hard,
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:13.120]   like I work crazy hard, but I've also worked
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.240]   with a lot of people that are just much better than me.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.240]   So hard work does not equal skill, good, productive.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.400]   I just want to kind of draw that distinction,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.680]   but I agree with you, I don't think our society rewards
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.560]   directly hard work or even high skill.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.800]   There's many examples, at least we can see,
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.240]   that it does not do so.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.480]   - So we have an unequal distribution of talent, of course.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.640]   So if we lived in a society in which there was
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.240]   some level of acceptable inequality,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.760]   and it's a normative kind of question
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.160]   of how much we would say is acceptable, right?
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.240]   And that inequality was based on this unequal distribution
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.360]   of talent, then I think that would be fine with me, right?
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.320]   That would actually be a meritocracy.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.200]   What I see in the US is often, okay,
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.400]   so if you are a upper middle class or rich kid,
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.360]   and you get a good education, K through 12,
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.280]   out of those people, there will be some
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.920]   that work extra hard and go on to do incredible things
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.160]   or are very successful, and there'll be other people
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.160]   that do not, right?
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.280]   And decide for whatever reason or go down a different path.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.400]   And you could say maybe among that group
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.800]   of the upper middle class, there is a meritocracy, right?
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.040]   But they're actually given those opportunities
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.440]   to make their own decisions and to fail,
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.400]   whereas many, many other people,
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.600]   the vast majority of American society,
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.120]   I would say 60 plus percent,
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.680]   don't really get those opportunities
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.200]   to make those choices to begin with.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.560]   And I would aspire to the type of world,
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.560]   at least as a first step, in which our only inequalities
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   are based on our unequal, innate distributions of talent.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.920]   - Yeah, I guess a lot of people worry
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.240]   that when you have a socialist
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.520]   in any degree central planning,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.440]   or perhaps a collective of workers,
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.720]   that it won't result in that kind of meritocracy
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.560]   that you're talking about.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.920]   But you're saying that no, it's possible
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.440]   to have that kind of meritocracy.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.640]   - Think about it this way.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.040]   The workers themselves are incentivized
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.000]   and are shaped by market forces too, right?
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.480]   They're trying to respond to consumer needs and preferences.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.720]   They're trying to expand market share.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.040]   They're trying to make money.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.120]   So it requires no kind of leap into,
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.600]   these people are gonna be more altruistic or whatever else,
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.680]   even on purely bourgeois terms,
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.320]   the same way you would maybe justify
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.560]   competitive capitalist firms.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.760]   I think you could justify this system
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.520]   as long as you think that people,
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.840]   elected management can perform just as well.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.880]   I think based on the experiences of cooperatives,
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.840]   we've seen that they can.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.560]   And then at the state level,
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:59.560]   state bureaucracies have their own sort of sets of incentives
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.040]   but in most systems
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.880]   that already have extensive state bureaucracies,
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.200]   these people at high levels are appointed or elected,
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.680]   they're held to certain standards.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.960]   At the national level,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.360]   a national government wants to maintain the tax revenue
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.040]   that they need to pay for school services.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.280]   So we already, I think, have incentive structures
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.720]   that you could say that some people might just,
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.000]   I think, disagree with the normative thing of like,
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.880]   why would people have to own their own means of production,
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.280]   control their workplaces or whatever else?
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.520]   Why do we need this level of equality?
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.360]   Can't we just get by with our existing system
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.600]   but just like make things a little bit easier
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.680]   for capitalists to make money
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.360]   and then everyone will benefit or whatever else.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.040]   I mean, that's a normative question.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.600]   In my vision of socialism,
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.160]   there'll be plenty of multiple parties
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.720]   with different views and perspectives
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.280]   trying to either push us deeper
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.240]   into more radical forms of socialism
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.600]   or on the other hand, to kind of roll back
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.920]   to more capitalist forms of government.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.400]   So I think that, again,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.920]   you can't try to make up a perfect system
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.720]   and try to implement it.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:11.720]   You have to do it as a process democratically and so on.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.800]   - So just philosophically, in your gut,
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.560]   you're more concerned about the innate equal value
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.000]   of human beings versus the efficiency
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.440]   of this wonderful mechanism that we call human civilization
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.240]   at producing cool stuff.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.960]   Just like a gut, if we were sitting at a bar,
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.480]   that's where the gut feeling you come with.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.760]   Of course, your mind is open
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.300]   but you want to protect the equal value of humans.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.880]   - So I don't want to fight the hypothetical.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.000]   So I'll say equality.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.760]   I am concerned with equality
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.340]   but I don't think the two are necessarily always in tension.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.280]   But also when you think about all the great things
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.640]   that human beings have produced,
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.400]   often I think people today just look at the end outcome.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.800]   Like we go to the pyramids
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.520]   and we'll marvel at the pyramids
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.400]   and the human achievement that it took to make it happen
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.800]   but we won't stop to think about all the suffering
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.460]   that went into the making of that thing.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.220]   So I think we kind of lean in the opposite direction
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.960]   where we marvel at our achievements
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.280]   but we don't often think about the suffering
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.600]   or exploitation that went into certain human achievements.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.880]   I would love a society in which we could marvel at things
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.480]   and not have to worry about the exploitation
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.400]   that was involved because there was no exploitation
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.640]   or oppression involved.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.960]   There was just human ingenuity
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.080]   and creativity and collaboration.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.440]   - And to the degree, which you may disagree,
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.920]   to the degree there's a tension between the two,
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.320]   at least give equal weight
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.120]   to the consideration of the suffering
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.280]   and don't just marvel at the beauty of the creations.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.120]   To the degree there is a tension between the two.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.400]   - What Stalin did actually too, it's not just capitalists,
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.560]   but what Stalin did was he sacrificed whole generations
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.720]   because he thought that he was building something
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:05.360]   for the future, for future Russians to enjoy
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.160]   and for future people of the world to enjoy.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.840]   And actually that analogy that I just gave
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:15.280]   about the pyramids was written by Karl Kotzke,
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.200]   the German socialist, anti-Stalinist critic,
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.300]   when he was complaining about US journalists and others
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:25.120]   going to Russia in the 1930s
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.880]   and marveling at all the new industries.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.800]   Are these people blind to the suffering
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.320]   behind these things that they're marveling about?
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.960]   - Speaking of which, I think you mentioned
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.240]   in the context of a social democracy
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.880]   that freedom of speech and freedom of the press
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:43.120]   or basically the freedom of people to have a voice
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.740]   is an important component,
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:47.640]   which I think is something that caught my ear a little bit
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.880]   because if you think about the Soviet Union,
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   one of the ways that the authoritarian regime
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.960]   was able to control,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.760]   it's almost part of the central planning
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.000]   is you have to control the message
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.640]   and you have to limit the freedom of the press.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:05.960]   So there's a kind of notion, especially in like ideas
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.680]   or maybe caricatures of the ideas of cultural Marxism,
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.840]   sometimes caricatured even further as wokeism,
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.440]   that you wanna be careful with speech.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.640]   You want to censor speech because some speech hurts people.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.880]   So in some sense, you want to respect the value,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.940]   the equality of human beings
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.000]   by being careful with the words you say.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.320]   So is there a tension there for you?
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.840]   - I think there's no tension.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.680]   And part, I think that it is very condescending
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.120]   or patronizing to assume that people can't take debate,
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.960]   that people can't either as a society or individuals
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.000]   visually be engaged in the exchange of ideas
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.960]   without or even very vigorous debate
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.800]   without being broken by it.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.080]   It's just not the case.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.080]   - I'm basically a free speech absolutist.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.240]   I mean, I would draw the line at obviously
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.120]   direct incitements of violence
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.240]   or certain other speech like that, but in general.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.320]   - Do you think a lot of people
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.920]   would be surprised to hear that?
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.680]   - No, I mean, not people who know my work.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.680]   I mean, more generally, I think a lot of people on the right
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.860]   even in the center, I think might have the idea
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:24.720]   that a lot of the far left wants to censor them.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.160]   I think some of the center left wants to censor them,
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.240]   but I think a lot on the far left,
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.440]   on the Marxist or socialist left,
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.440]   I think that free speech is more or less the norm.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:43.200]   - Yeah, where is the imperative to censor coming from?
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.960]   Is this just some small subset of the left on Twitter?
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.320]   Is there some philosophical idea behind certain groups
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.040]   that like if we're to steal me on the case
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.200]   in which group actually has the interest of humanity
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.160]   in mind in wanting to censor speech?
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.560]   - I think we might need to just take it case by case
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.440]   for an example by example, 'cause honestly,
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.200]   I would have to think about a particular case,
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.880]   but let's just say generally that a lot of American
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   liberalism rightly sees the revolution
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.380]   around the civil rights and later the extension
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:28.080]   of this rights revolution for gay rights and so on
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.080]   as being a very positive achievement
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.940]   of the last half century and I completely agree.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:39.000]   Now for me, now that we've won those rights,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.120]   a lot of our battle for change needs to go beyond
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.880]   the representational realm and needs to really reground
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.400]   itself in the material bread and butter struggles
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.160]   of ordinary people trying to survive,
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.960]   the battle for good healthcare for all Americans
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.160]   and so on, these are my immediate demands.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.680]   I think there's a segment of American liberalism
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.920]   that doesn't want to go in that confrontational
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:07.080]   economic direction and wants to skirt away
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.760]   from battles over things like universal healthcare
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.780]   and so on and really are just still caught
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.240]   at this battle over rights and representation
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.080]   and it's devolved in such a way that they feel
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.240]   like they need to make change the way they make change
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.760]   is only through interventions and culture
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.320]   'cause they don't really have the same sense
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.200]   of class and class struggle that agree or disagree with it.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200]   It's a very material plane.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.120]   So instead, they look at comedians who said
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   the wrong thing or they look at all sorts of other ways
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.080]   to make change that's not really making a change,
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.080]   it's just making them look bad and making our culture worse
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.240]   and I think that's where a lot of it comes from
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.640]   but I think that a lot of the left,
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.640]   even the left that's much more into battles over race
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.200]   and lots of other stuff like real serious anti-racist
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.800]   on the left, of course I'm an anti-racist
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.380]   but a lot of my work is focused on the primacy of class
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.980]   but even these people are very concerned
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:15.160]   about material struggles and issues
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.960]   and they don't really care about these issues
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.480]   they think are ephemeral kind of issues.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.880]   - So when you focus exclusively on language
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.600]   that somehow leads you astray,
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.760]   like on being concerned about language
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   without like deeper economic inequalities and so on,
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.680]   you just become an asshole.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.920]   That's on Twitter pointing out how everything,
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.000]   how racist everyone is.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.320]   So the anti-racism becomes a caricature of anti-racism.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.240]   - Exactly 'cause anti-racism was really about
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.760]   the struggle of people for equal rights and voting.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.640]   It was about the struggle for people
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.360]   who were trapped into bad neighborhoods
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.080]   because they couldn't get decent jobs
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.080]   and their neighborhoods were redlined or whatever else.
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.040]   It was really like a struggle for survival.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.080]   And what was the main demands, like the language of this?
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.120]   One, it was the march for jobs and freedom.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.280]   It was the slogan, I am a man,
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.600]   asserting the kind of universal dignity of people.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.440]   This is what the civil rights movement was about.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.400]   And it wasn't a surprise,
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.560]   there was a lot of self-described socialists,
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.480]   people like Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph,
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.640]   Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:33.800]   I mean, these were people who were,
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.880]   Ella Baker, they were socialists.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:39.480]   And I think a lot of Americans agree with them
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.640]   with their immediate demands,
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.760]   even though they weren't themselves socialists,
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.600]   but it was a very materialistic struggle.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.640]   And I think a lot of this has been co-opted
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.800]   into just some sort of vague
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.800]   and just disconcerting complaints
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.960]   about language or culture and so on.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.600]   - Martin Luther King was a socialist.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.920]   To what degree was he a socialist?
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.760]   I would love to learn about that.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.520]   - Martin Luther King, I think, broadly called himself
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.560]   at various points in his life,
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:13.280]   a Christian socialist or a democratic socialist,
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.280]   especially after his speech against the Vietnam War
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.360]   and the Riverside Church, I think that was '67,
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.600]   the last years of his life,
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.920]   he became much more involved in struggles against the war
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.520]   and also struggles for workers' rights.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.760]   He was assassinated when he was at a rally
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.080]   at workers' rights, so he thought the next battle
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.880]   was gonna be an economic battle.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.160]   He had this famous line where he said,
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.680]   "I don't just want to integrate the lunch counter
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.200]   "if it means that we can't afford to order a burger
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.240]   "while we're there."
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.680]   That was the line along those lines.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.800]   And I think that got to his point
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.120]   where the civil rights struggle was part of a step
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.080]   of building some sort of wider movement.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.840]   So he and these other civil rights leaders
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.000]   were very much interested in working with organized labor,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.080]   with working with the left as it was constructed then,
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.760]   and building some sort of mass space
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.640]   for not just rights, but redistribution.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.720]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.480]   It's fascinating which figures self-identified
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.920]   and were in part socialists.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.560]   - Albert Einstein was one.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.400]   - Albert Einstein was a socialist.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.680]   - Albert Einstein wrote an article
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.560]   for the first issue of this left-wing magazine.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.600]   It's actually still publishing today
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.400]   called "Monthly Review" in, I think, 1949.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.680]   And his article was called "Why Socialism?"
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.760]   I don't think it's paywalled,
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:35.080]   so people should check it out.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.320]   But yeah, Einstein was one.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.640]   - Huh, huh.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.040]   So probably the central idea is the pacifist,
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.280]   the anti-war idea for him, or no?
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.200]   - Honestly, it's been so many years since I read it.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.080]   I think it was more about,
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.480]   I think it was actually more economically focused,
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.920]   but I would need to go back and read it.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.040]   - But is war in general a part
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.920]   of the fundamental ideas that socialists are against,
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.600]   Democratic socialists are against?
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.480]   Like, what's the relation between socialism and war?
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.600]   - So I think that traditionally in the socialist movement,
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.440]   war was associated with capitalist competition
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.040]   and international competition.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.480]   And you can look at World War I as very much a case
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.760]   where different nations were competing with each other
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.760]   and developing quite violent rivalries
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.080]   that was in part based on competition
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.360]   and the periphery over access to markets and colonies
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.560]   and whatever else.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:33.360]   So it was very easy to draw a direct correlation.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.040]   I am opposed to war.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.400]   I'm opposed to imperialism,
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.640]   the domination of strong nations,
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.300]   dominating smaller nations.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.080]   I wouldn't call myself a pacifist.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.440]   I think most socialists wouldn't call themselves pacifists
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.720]   because there are some struggles that are worth fighting for.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.440]   There's national liberation struggles and so on,
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.040]   where if there's no democratic avenue for change,
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.360]   positive change has been made through armed revolts
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.240]   around colonialism and whatnot.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.400]   But we're living in an age where hopefully,
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.800]   I know neither of us have children,
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.880]   our children or children's children in the future
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.960]   won't have to live through war.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.260]   And that is one thing that as countries
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.960]   have gotten more developed, as the world has changed,
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   we've actually seen less and less war.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.600]   Like I won't dispute Pinker on this.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.580]   I think it's true.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:32.520]   Obviously Putin's invasion of Ukraine
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.180]   and the conflict in Ethiopia is like kind of an exception,
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:41.180]   but on the whole, I think we're going in that direction.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.080]   But I think it's always been a major organizing plank
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.000]   of socialists against war and against just kind of
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.440]   this sense of right-wing nationalism and national identity
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.880]   that often leads to war.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.080]   And obviously not everyone on the right has embraced that.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:00.800]   A lot of libertarians are consistently anti-war as well.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.160]   But I think the right ideologically
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.560]   has been associated with war,
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.200]   even if some advocates of capitalism have not been.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.420]   - Then there's the military industrial complex,
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.880]   which is the financial machine of the whole thing.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.880]   I presume, well, well, since a lot of that is government,
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.200]   what's the relation to socialism
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.340]   and the military industrial complex?
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.240]   - Well, a lot of it's government contracts,
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.640]   but it's privately produced, right?
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.460]   By companies like Lockheed Martin and things like that.
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:35.400]   You could draw a very crude materialist connection
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.640]   between any of these things
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.960]   and to kind of prove an ideological point,
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.560]   but we could produce just as many arms
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.640]   and then just bury them or never fire them off
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:46.120]   or whatever else.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.220]   Obviously there are companies that have a vested interest
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.820]   in heightening up tensions
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:55.400]   or saying that we need to buy a new weapon system
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.040]   and be prepared for a conventional war with China, Russia.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.480]   Meanwhile, I think we all know
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.000]   that if there's gonna be a conventional war
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.200]   between these countries,
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.380]   it's gonna lead to something worse.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:11.720]   And no amount of advanced fighter jets
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.520]   is gonna make a difference.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.240]   But I try to avoid cruder, causal connections,
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.680]   even though there are relationships.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.260]   It's kind of like the old slogan,
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:27.720]   which was quite an effective slogan in the early 2000s.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.920]   At my first anti-war marches when I was a teenager,
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.000]   I definitely have shouted it,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.960]   but kind of no war for oil.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.920]   Like both is correct in that it gets to what people's senses
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:39.960]   of what's going on and how it's bad,
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.160]   but also analytically it's kind of wanting
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.260]   to explain what really happened
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:47.840]   or why we ended up in the Middle East,
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.340]   which is a much more complex geopolitical story.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:54.060]   - Yeah, and it is a story of geopolitics.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:58.980]   It's perhaps less a story of capitalism or socialism.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:03.580]   It's a story, yeah, it's a geopolitical story
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:05.660]   that I think actually operates outside
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:08.520]   of the economic system of the individual nations.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:13.320]   It has to do more with, honestly, in part, egos of leaders.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:19.600]   And there's a international battle for resources,
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.000]   but surely there's alternatives.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:22.840]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:26.380]   I think that part of what being a socialist is
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.000]   is about dreaming in the long-term
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.280]   about a different sort of world without, in my mind,
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.620]   needless divisions of people into nations
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.800]   with standing armies.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.600]   I'm sure we'll still have pride about where we're from
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.740]   and there'll still be distinctive cultural features
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.380]   and so on about where we're from.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:47.680]   We definitely would, at least for the foreseeable future,
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.420]   be divided into places as like administrative units,
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:55.620]   but the idea that there should be a Mexican army
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.060]   and an American army and a Russian army
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:01.140]   and a Ukrainian army is just on the face of it,
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:04.020]   I think in the long run will be seen as ridiculous,
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.140]   just like we see it as ridiculous today,
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:11.140]   looking back at the idea that a lord from London
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.780]   would be engaged in civil strife
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:18.380]   with a lord from Liverpool
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.580]   and a bunch of peasants would die.
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.940]   Just kind of on the face of it just seems kind of ridiculous
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:25.380]   that these different places would have their own banners
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:26.740]   and lords and armies.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.060]   I think in the long run,
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.660]   you might have to zoom out 1,000 years,
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.980]   but in the long run, people will say the same
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.780]   about nation states and standing armies
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:39.780]   and battles over specks of dirt
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:42.200]   that mean nothing in a cosmic sense.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.440]   - Yeah, no, for sure, aliens would laugh at us
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.060]   or humans that go far beyond Earth
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:52.860]   and look at the history, hmm.
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:55.660]   Well, most of the history will be forgotten
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.420]   because if humans successfully expand out into the universe,
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.380]   just the scale of civilization will grow so fast
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:06.460]   that the bickering of the first few thousand years
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.860]   of human history will seem insignificant.
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:11.340]   - There's a very Marxist idea
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:13.260]   that I both appreciate in one way,
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:14.820]   but on the other hand, it's kind of scary,
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.720]   which is that human history is only now beginning
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.700]   before we're in prehistory,
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:24.300]   but in the future, we'll be in real history.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.460]   I think that a lot of really important history
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:29.380]   has already happened,
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:33.500]   and I think posterity will remember it,
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:36.420]   and I think that it will be easier to assign
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:40.260]   to certain people the role of villains,
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:44.900]   the people not to engage in the contentious topic,
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.940]   off topic of Ukraine or whatever else,
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.980]   but the idea that one government or man
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:53.180]   would launch a war to recover
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:58.560]   or to take several hundred square miles of territory
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.220]   and tens of thousands of people will die,
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:03.480]   I think seems absurd to us, many people today, luckily,
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.620]   but it would not have seemed absurd 50, 60 years ago.
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.180]   It would have just been a normal thing,
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:09.980]   these kind of territorial disputes and so on,
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.900]   and I think projecting the future,
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.120]   I think within our lifetimes,
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.640]   we'll live to see that kind of conflict be eradicated,
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:22.600]   and in part, you could say that, like, why?
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.080]   I think it's because of popular pressure and organization,
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.020]   so you could say kind of the pro-worker,
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:30.400]   socialist organizing part of it, making it less normal,
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.480]   but if you're a capitalist, you could say,
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.160]   well, markets are more interlinked,
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.840]   so war is even more irrational.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.240]   I don't really have a firm answer, whatever it is,
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.540]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.680]   - You mentioned Marxist view of history,
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.120]   it's kind of interesting to just briefly talk about,
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.200]   what do you think of it?
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.240]   What do you think of this Marxist view
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.780]   of how the different systems evolve
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.280]   from the perspective of class struggle,
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.080]   is what we're talking about?
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.720]   - Well, I fundamentally, I'm a Marxist,
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.160]   I fundamentally believe in the broad contours
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:04.320]   of historical materialism,
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.800]   but I think we should be clear on what Marxist theory
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.840]   tells us and what it doesn't tell us.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.920]   I think Marxist theory tells us pertinent things
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.080]   about how societies evolve,
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.640]   about how the distributional resources work
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.800]   in any given society, who owns, who doesn't,
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.400]   how the conflict, distributional conflicts and so on.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.400]   I think Marxism can tell us a lot.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.240]   - How surplus is distributed.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.680]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:37.480]   What it can't tell us is, as a friend put it,
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.800]   the sex appeal of blue jeans or whatever else,
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.520]   that's beyond what Marxism is meant to do.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.120]   - What economic system can tell us
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.640]   about the sex appeal of blue jeans?
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.720]   - No economic system, but socialism in the Soviet sense,
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.280]   when it was turned into the Soviet style,
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.960]   dialectical materialism, was meant to tell us everything
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:02.960]   from explain genetics and agriculture and whatever else
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:07.600]   in a very disastrous way.
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.960]   So I definitely don't believe in the application
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:15.560]   of these ideas in an extremely wide way.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:18.120]   And also I'm a Marxist because it's a framework
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:21.760]   that helps me understand pertinent facts about the world.
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:26.480]   If at some point I no longer think the framework
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.320]   is doing that, I will not be a Marxist,
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.080]   but I'm a socialist on normative grounds
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:36.360]   because I have certain beliefs about the equality of people
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.640]   because I believe we should have a society with liberty,
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.920]   with equality, with fraternity.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.360]   And that I hope I'll always be a socialist
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.520]   until the day I die, but it's kind of a very unscientific
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.400]   or unserious thing to say, this is my framework
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.840]   from beginning to end for the rest of my life.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.640]   - But from a perspective of history,
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.560]   you should say that, so Marx says that you go through,
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.440]   societies go through different stages.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:06.920]   It could be crudely summarized as primitive communism,
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:10.120]   imperialism, maybe slave society, feudalism,
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:16.800]   defined by marketalism, and then capitalism and socialism,
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.760]   and finally stateless communism, communism.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.920]   Did I miss something there?
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.520]   - I mean, I think that was close enough.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.960]   I mean, I think that's definitely true of Marxist theory
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.520]   that the contradictions of capitalism,
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:37.720]   the fact that it has brought together all these workers,
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.200]   all these materials and whatever else,
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.760]   and it's now allowing it to socially create wealth
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:47.000]   on a mass scale, but that wealth is,
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.160]   that process is being privately directed.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.880]   And also the surplus is being privately kind of appropriated
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.160]   is a contradiction.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:59.960]   And that would lead to some sort of rebellion
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.360]   or revolution or change.
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.920]   And eventually this contradiction
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.280]   would be a Federal production too.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.200]   So we would have to move into a socialist society.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.840]   - But actually just to backtrack,
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.760]   so in terms of contradictions,
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.320]   so it starts when we're in a village, hunter gatherers,
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.240]   that's what you call primitive communism,
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.080]   where everyone's kind of equal.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.360]   It's kind of a collective, right?
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.040]   All right, maybe you could just let me, hold on a second.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.520]   And then inequalities form of different flavors.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.800]   So that's what imperialism is,
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:31.120]   is one dude rises to the top
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.080]   and has some control of different flavor.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.560]   That's what feudalism with,
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.480]   when you have one dude at the top
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:40.960]   and you have merchants doing some trading and so on.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.360]   And then that leads to capitalism
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:45.040]   when you have private ownership of companies
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.040]   and they do some,
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:49.120]   they result in some kind of class inequality.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.600]   And eventually that results in a revolution
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.840]   that says, no, this inequality is not okay,
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:57.680]   it's not natural,
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.240]   it doesn't respect the value of human beings
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.440]   and therefore it goes to socialism.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:05.400]   Where there is, under Marx's view,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.140]   I guess some role for the state.
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.360]   State is doing some redistribution
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:14.920]   and then the pure communism at the end is when it's,
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:22.360]   it's a collective where there's no state centralized power.
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.960]   - So-- - What part of that is wrong?
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:29.480]   - No, I think broadly the Marxist theory of history
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:35.400]   is about different types, different modes of production
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:41.040]   that exist at various times based on material conditions.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.220]   So in the early times in this theory,
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:48.840]   there was not much surplus being generated, right?
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.440]   And there was generally egalitarian societies.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.320]   Then as we became agricultural, as society developed,
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.600]   there was more surplus being produced.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.560]   And then there was a group of people
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:05.700]   that were ruling classes of their age
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:09.080]   that controlled and distributed that,
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.240]   that controlled that divisional labor
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.880]   and appropriated more of that surplus for themselves.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.480]   And they weren't involved in productive labor.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.680]   In early primitive society,
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.160]   everybody's involved in productive labor.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.880]   Later on, you had castes of priests
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.720]   who did nothing but kind of pray and write
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.320]   and kind of lecture people all day, right?
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.760]   And you had kings and rulers and bureaucrats
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.920]   and traders and so on.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.320]   You have a more complex division of labor,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.580]   but also more inequity driving out of that.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:43.120]   Capitalism was a revolutionary system
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.840]   because it took away,
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.360]   one, it made us tremendously more productive, right?
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.720]   It expanded production beyond our wildest imaginations,
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:55.160]   but it also no longer bound workers
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:58.280]   to their lord or manor or whatever else.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.600]   They were now free to move,
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.820]   free to engage in contracts with employers and so on.
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:07.580]   But even though workers are now producing
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:09.120]   all this tremendous wealth,
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:10.640]   and even though productive forces
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.040]   had been matured in such a way,
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.720]   they were ultimately taken away
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.840]   from all the wealth that they were created.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.080]   They got some of it back.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.960]   They were in wealthy societies,
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.080]   but they were all there collectively together
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.600]   producing this wealth.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.520]   And that was a potent force.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:30.840]   So Marx theorized that would lead to a revolution
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.720]   or change in a socialist direction.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.900]   I think, in fact, what we saw was that,
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:40.100]   yes, workers are dependent on,
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:43.800]   capitalists are dependent on workers,
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.880]   but the dependency is obviously symmetrical
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:51.240]   in the sense that workers are also dependent on capitalists,
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.400]   but in fact, it's an asymmetrical dependency
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.320]   in that ordinary workers need their jobs
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:59.340]   more than capitalists need the contribution
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:02.440]   of individual workers.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.640]   So it became kind of a collective action problem
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.560]   where you would need the mass of workers to get together,
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.800]   decide to change things,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:11.080]   but also people would be afraid
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:12.640]   because they'd be dependent on their jobs
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.440]   for their livelihood and so on.
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:18.560]   So revolution became a lot harder than people thought,
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.440]   especially in democratic countries
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.400]   where workers had certain outlets
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.920]   and certain powers and rights and responsibility.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:27.360]   It's no surprise that
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.960]   where you did have socialist revolutions,
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.600]   they were in places like the third world,
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.800]   post-colonial states trying to emerge out of colonialism.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.520]   They were in places like China and Russia,
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.720]   autocratic countries,
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.720]   and never in a advanced capitalist country.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.560]   Now, in Marxist theory of history,
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.680]   even as interpreted by a lot of smart Marxists
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.860]   like G.A. Cohen and others,
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:58.840]   there is a certain inevitability
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.760]   to socialism after capitalism.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:04.800]   The way that I would put it myself
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.720]   is I kind of have a more,
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.320]   I guess you could say like Kantian view of it.
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:12.440]   Like I think socialism is something that ought to happen,
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:16.800]   but it's not something that necessarily will happen
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.920]   and we'll need to organize and persuade.
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:23.520]   And also potentially, again,
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.840]   the key part of any social system that's democratic
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:30.360]   is you have to allow for the possibility
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:33.520]   of a democratic revision to a different sort of system.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.560]   So I'd be more than happy in my vision of socialism
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.320]   for there to be capitalist parties
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.720]   getting, you know,
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.640]   hopefully three, four, or 5% of the vote,
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:43.760]   maybe a lot more,
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.280]   in the same way that in the US or a republic
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.360]   we could right now have a monarchist party.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.080]   No one's gonna support a monarchist party
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.960]   in the US in serious numbers.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.880]   - Although that's gaining popularity.
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:56.840]   - In Europe or elsewhere?
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:01.840]   - No, in, isn't there, in the anarchist tradition,
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:04.000]   isn't there, aren't they saying that
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.920]   one of the ways you could have a leader's in monarchy,
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:10.080]   because they're more directly responsible to the citizens.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.640]   If you have a leader, it's healthier to have a monarch.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.120]   Anyway, I'm not familiar with this,
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.440]   but I have heard this stated multiple times.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.720]   - In the left-wing anarchist traditions,
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.360]   like anarcho-syndicalism or whatever else,
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:26.840]   like their slogan is kind of no kings,
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:30.480]   no gods, no masters or whatever, so, no bosses.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:32.320]   So they definitely would not agree with that,
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.560]   but I'm not familiar enough.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:38.240]   Anarchism runs a gamut from left to right
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.080]   in interesting ways.
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:42.040]   - I'll have to ask about that.
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.920]   But yeah, okay, so you're not,
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:48.320]   you don't believe Marx's theory of history
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.680]   in the sense that everything,
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.480]   every stage is a natural consequence of every other stage.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.560]   Of course, he would predict that somebody like you
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:59.160]   must exist in order for those stages
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:01.080]   to go from one to the next, 'cause you might,
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.680]   'cause you have to believe ought
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.280]   in order for action to be taken,
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.400]   to inspire the populace to take action.
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.960]   - So, two things.
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.200]   One is, I do broadly believe in Marx's theory of history,
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:17.080]   'cause it's just explaining how productive forces develop
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.760]   and the relations of production in any given system.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.200]   I guess there's a theory of transition
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.000]   from capitalism to socialism
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.480]   that Marx didn't really spell out,
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:30.760]   but it was kind of implied that it would naturally happen.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.040]   And Marx was living in an era of tremendous upheaval.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:35.520]   Marx himself actually saw,
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.080]   when he was living in London in the 1870s,
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.200]   the Paris Commune,
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.480]   when workers took over for just a few months,
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.640]   but they took over, the producers of Paris
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.800]   took over the city,
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.200]   basically created their own government,
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.840]   their own system, and so on.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.080]   So he was living through an era of upheaval.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:57.320]   And Engels, especially, oversaw and was the mentor
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:00.720]   to all these rising socialist parties.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.920]   So he was very closely collaborating with socialists
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.200]   in places like Britain and Germany,
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.840]   when they were drafting their first programs
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:13.040]   for the Social Democratic Party.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.240]   So it felt like this was gonna happen.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.560]   It felt like this rise in working class would take power,
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.240]   but I think the stability of the system was underestimated.
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.680]   It's easy to see the contradictions in the system,
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:30.960]   but can you see its mechanisms of stability?
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.480]   The way in which mass collective action or revolution
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.920]   is more the exception or the norm.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.920]   Could you have imagined, if you're Marx,
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:42.320]   not only how much wealth the system would produce over time,
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.120]   which I think you could have imagined,
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.840]   but also developments like the welfare state
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.600]   and mass democracy and universal suffrage,
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:53.480]   which might've changed how workers relate to the system
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.840]   or operate within it.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.520]   So I think it's just the transition part
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.960]   that I think wasn't spelled out properly.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.240]   But I think in either case, as socialists,
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:07.960]   we can't assume that history is working in our favor.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:09.720]   We just need to kind of hold out
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.960]   and wait for the inevitable revolution.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:15.560]   We have to convince people of both,
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.000]   one, the struggle for day-to-day reforms
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.200]   and why it's important to be politically organized,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.520]   why it's important to be a member of a union
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.400]   or to advocate for things like universal healthcare
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.200]   or whatever else to try to kind of build the cohesion
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.520]   and sense of self of the class,
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.800]   then ultimately for the desirability,
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.480]   once we accomplish it, once we build social democracy,
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.280]   of going beyond social democracy,
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.160]   which is, of course, the challenge.
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.960]   Now, I don't think it requires leadership from the outside.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:47.960]   I think there are plenty of organic leaders
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.560]   that have emerged from the working class
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:54.560]   that have advocated for socialism from the working class.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.280]   And if you look at the class composition
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.600]   during the glory days of the European socialist parties,
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:06.920]   I mean, this was very much a working class parties
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.760]   and organizations.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.320]   It's only been the last like 30 years
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.160]   that it's been taken over by professionals
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.920]   and not coincidentally,
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.240]   they have accomplished very little in those 30 years.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.840]   - So that's the practical and the pragmatic.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.680]   Can we actually jump to the, at the horizon?
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:29.040]   As you mentioned, as a social democrat,
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.840]   you focus on the policies of today,
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.560]   but you also have a vision and dream of a future.
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:35.040]   And so Marx did as well.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.640]   So the perfect communism at the end.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.160]   Can you describe that world?
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:42.040]   Also, is there elements to that world
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.080]   that has elements of anarchism?
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.760]   So again, like I said, there's Michael Malice next door.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.720]   So like a narco communism,
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:54.840]   I don't even know if I'm using that term correctly,
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:57.720]   but basically no central control.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:59.480]   Can you describe what that world looks like?
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:02.800]   - I think the traditional socialist vision
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.440]   of kind of, if you want to call it full communism
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:09.200]   would be very similar to the anarchist vision
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.640]   of a world without coercion, mass abundance and so on.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.840]   I myself don't share that vision.
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:22.520]   I believe that we will always need to have a state
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.040]   in some form as a way to, one,
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.120]   even just mediate difference.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.040]   I think traditionally a lot of Marxists have thought
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.400]   that after you remove the primary contradiction,
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.680]   quote unquote, of class,
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:41.200]   that the other, all other political questions
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.920]   would be resolved.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.840]   And I think that's a lot behind a lot of the thinking
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.640]   of we're gonna have a full communism after politics.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.520]   I don't think there will be an after politics.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.040]   I think for one thing, let's say,
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.920]   I'll give you another Northeast example.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:57.560]   Let's say me and you are trying to,
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:58.640]   with different groups of people,
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.920]   we're trying to figure out how to build a crossing
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.280]   of the Hudson River.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.360]   And for various reasons, you and the people around you
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.720]   want to build a bridge.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:10.040]   Me and the people around me need, want to build a tunnel.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:13.800]   That's a question that you will probably need
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.200]   a mediation for, right?
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.360]   You'll need, one, it's a big project,
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.880]   so there'll be a very complex division of labor and so on.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.800]   But even beyond that, just politically,
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.280]   you will need the state to mediate the difference.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.920]   You'll need to have a vote, have a vote that people trust,
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.280]   have institutions that people trust,
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.640]   and so on to make a decision.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.680]   Society is never going to go beyond that decision-making.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.840]   - You don't think it's possible outside of the state
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:41.680]   to create stable voting mechanisms?
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:44.640]   Or is human nature going to always seep into that?
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.640]   - I just wonder why we would have to,
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.280]   if the state is democratic and responsive,
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.840]   the state isn't authoritarian.
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:54.160]   - So it might not be called a state,
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.720]   but it would function as a state, right?
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:56.920]   - But why not just call it a state?
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.200]   But in other words, if you don't have something like that,
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:02.840]   then don't you have a greater risk of tyranny
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:05.000]   or a tyrant emerging in the vacuum?
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.560]   - So I think people's fear of the state
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:10.760]   is what would happen if the state had too much power.
[02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:12.200]   And I think that's a legitimate fear.
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:15.320]   That's why we have democratic checks on state power
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.120]   and certain guarantees of freedom and so on.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.920]   But yeah, I guess I just wonder,
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:24.520]   I'm more afraid of the vacuum
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:27.600]   and not having a democratic, responsive state
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.600]   and what the world would turn into.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:31.440]   And also, I'm just not a utopian thinker,
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.280]   if that makes sense.
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.520]   I like to think that I'm an egalitarian thinker.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.520]   I'm a socialist, but my mind just goes to,
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:45.680]   I can see a vision of the future
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:48.640]   that I would like 50, 60 years from now.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.120]   Maybe there's some sort of future
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.640]   of super abundance and automation,
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:57.240]   and there's some sort of techno-utopian future.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.440]   We don't want some of those things
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:04.320]   that would exist in my five minutes for now
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:08.480]   vision of socialism, but I just don't see it.
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:13.160]   And in general, I'm kind of wary of visions of change
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:17.760]   that seem like they're not built off little pieces
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.920]   that we have now and not built off history
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.560]   and experience and whatever else.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.360]   I don't want a year zero.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.280]   I don't even like the term prehistory
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:28.520]   because I think there's a lot in history
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:32.120]   that I want Shakespeare under socialism.
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:33.400]   I want a lot of things
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:35.360]   that I think we should be grateful for.
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.800]   There's a part of tradition that I think that exists
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:42.360]   that's hierarchical and exploitative and whatever else,
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:43.880]   but there's another part of tradition
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:45.800]   that's our sense of place and belonging
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:47.720]   and our connection with the past
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.640]   and hopefully the future, and I wanna keep that.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:54.880]   - Yeah, so you're worried about revolution
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:56.760]   or otherwise a vacuum being created,
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:59.640]   and you're worried about the things
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:01.000]   that might fill that vacuum.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.600]   So the anarchists often worry about
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:09.160]   the same mechanism of the state that controls voting
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:13.280]   or keeps voting robust and resilient and stable,
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:16.320]   the same mechanism also having a monopoly on violence.
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.960]   And so that's the tension.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:23.040]   So they get very nervous about a central place
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:25.120]   having a monopoly on violence.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.000]   Whereas if there is gonna be a place
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.040]   for the monopoly on violence,
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:32.400]   let's just say we temporarily take that for granted,
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:37.280]   should it not be a place with a skilled,
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.440]   elected, accountable, transparent civil service
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:43.080]   with a democratic mandate and so on?
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well put.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.560]   Speaking of AI, just to go on that tangent,
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:50.320]   do you think it's possible to have a future world
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.240]   at least of 50 years, 50, 100 years
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:00.040]   where there's an AI sort of central planning?
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:05.240]   We remove some of the human elements
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:07.720]   that I think get us into a lot of trouble.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.840]   Like you can take a perspective on the Soviet Union
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:13.600]   and the flaws of the system there
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.640]   have less to do with the different ideologies
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.280]   and more to do with the humans and the vacuums
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.720]   and how humans fill vacuums
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:22.040]   and the corrupting nature of power and so on.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:25.480]   If we have AI that's more data-driven
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.600]   and is not susceptible to the human elements,
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.400]   is that possible to imagine such a world?
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:32.360]   Almost like from a sci-fi perspective.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.160]   - Maybe in the future you can imagine
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:35.960]   certain calculation problems
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:37.640]   that arose during central planning
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:40.640]   solved through advanced computing.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:45.160]   But I would say that there's another whole set of problems
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.480]   with the system that were incentive problems
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.080]   and I'm not sure how that advanced computing
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.400]   would solve the incentive problems of
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:55.640]   how do you get people to actually produce
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.880]   things that other people want?
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:59.240]   Kind of that informational question
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.120]   of how do you communicate without endless meetings
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.520]   or someone reading your brain what you actually want.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.960]   So there's that kind of informational question
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.800]   but then there's the incentive of
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.920]   how do you get people to work efficiently at work
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.920]   and how do you get firms to use their resources
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.840]   that they're getting more efficiently?
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.520]   And I think solving the calculation problem
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:30.840]   solves some of these questions but not all of them.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.400]   But that's kind of a who knows
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.720]   but if your vision of the future
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.640]   requires some sort of leap into a technological unknown
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.680]   that's very hard to advocate for today.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:43.600]   - It's exciting to consider the possibility of technology
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:47.800]   empowering a better reallocation of resources.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:50.080]   If you care about of kind of
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:53.320]   the innate value of human beings
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:56.280]   and think of the mechanism of reallocation of resources
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.320]   as a good way to empower that equality,
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:03.120]   that it's nice to remove the human element from that.
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.360]   Like if you work really hard
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.600]   and you're really good at your job,
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.760]   it's nice to be really data-driven
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.840]   in allocating more resources to you.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:16.400]   - So kind of, like I kind of think that
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.640]   the agency part requires human beings
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.800]   and conscious human activity.
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:26.840]   So I think if you have a sort of planning system that works
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:31.160]   and let's say the technology is there for it to work,
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.000]   I would want it to be democratic planning in such a way
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.240]   that there is a human element,
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.000]   there is some debate and deliberation in society.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.360]   And also even in my vision of socialism
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:43.560]   with the state sector and state investments and so on,
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.760]   I'd want there to be more public discussion and debate
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.720]   about certain things.
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:48.920]   So it's not just left to technocrats
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:51.200]   'cause you'd wanna live in society
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:53.480]   where you just find out the next day
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.400]   that there's some massive infrastructure project
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.120]   that you haven't had a chance to think about or debate
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.200]   or feel like you're participating in.
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.480]   - And debate is not just facts and logic.
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.400]   That's why if the whole universe was about facts and logic,
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:11.880]   computers could do a better job of that.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:14.840]   There's something about humans debating each other
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:17.680]   that goes into the difficult gray areas
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:20.600]   of what it means to be human
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.460]   or what it means to have a life that's worth living.
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:27.040]   That requires humanity.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.920]   And I'm also worried about,
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:30.560]   while I'm excited by the possibility
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:33.840]   of AI controlling everything, half joking,
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:36.400]   but the reason I'm really terrified of that
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.920]   is because usually there's a possibility
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:42.320]   of a human taking control of that system.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.720]   So you now start to get the same kind of authoritarian thing.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:48.480]   Well, I am a human, I'm smart enough
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:51.520]   to be able to control this AI system.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.040]   And I will do based on what this AI system says
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:56.600]   what's good for you.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:58.600]   It's kind of like talking down to people
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:01.600]   and then use that AI system to now have the same kind
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.760]   of thing as Hollywood and more in 1930s.
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:05.280]   - And also our preferences might change.
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.880]   So an AI system might say the goal of humanity
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.040]   is to just increase infinitely efficiency
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.280]   or increase output.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.960]   Whereas we might collectively decide
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:21.960]   that we have enough and we want to have a trade-off.
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.080]   And I think that we need a system
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:30.080]   that allows for people to make certain trade-offs.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.800]   - And have more of this leisure
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:35.520]   that I've been learning about from you.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.640]   This is a very interesting concept, leisure.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:39.960]   How do you spell that?
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:44.960]   All right, so if we can step into the practical,
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.240]   we were talking about historical and philosophical,
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.860]   into the practical of today.
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.560]   What are some of the exciting policies
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.300]   that represent democratic socialism today, modern socialism?
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:00.160]   I think you mentioned some of them,
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.460]   Medicare for all or universal healthcare.
[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:07.360]   Something you haven't mentioned is tuition-free college,
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.480]   increasing minimum wage,
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.520]   maybe stronger unions like we talked about.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.800]   What are some ideas here?
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.920]   What are some ideas that are especially policy,
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.960]   especially exciting to you?
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:20.240]   - Well, I think that hours reduction
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:24.040]   has always been an important demand for socialists.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:27.000]   So, I mean, it's been a reality in certain countries
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.720]   like France in recent decades,
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:33.320]   where part of the logic is,
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:34.680]   if you have a bunch of people working
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:37.720]   for 40 plus hours a week,
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:39.360]   and you also have some unemployed people
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.280]   who would like more employment,
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:42.880]   then it's not a zero-sum game.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:46.360]   You could reduce hours to 35 hours
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:49.840]   and still maintain the same output by employing more people
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:53.960]   to kind of fill the slack in hours.
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.880]   So one, I think it's a solidaristic thing
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:57.280]   in working class movements,
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.200]   between unemployed and employed workers.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:04.480]   I also think that, yeah, it gives people more time.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.680]   So Marx was a big advocate in his day
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:11.680]   of a 10-hour bill in the UK
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:15.000]   that would have reduced the hours of working time
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.200]   and reduced child or eliminated,
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:21.240]   or reduced child labor and other things as well.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.240]   And part of it was, this is a radical demand
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:25.880]   because it's reducing the sphere,
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:27.880]   as you saw, of exploitation.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.840]   So it's putting limits on how much time
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:32.800]   the capitals can take from ordinary workers
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:35.000]   and how much freedom they would have.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.840]   With healthcare, one, I just think it's a,
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.160]   a government healthcare system.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.720]   You could tell me that you don't want it in the US,
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.240]   but you can't tell me it doesn't work
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.440]   'cause we've seen it work
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.080]   in every other major industrial system in different forms.
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:52.520]   - So what does that usually involve?
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:54.680]   What does universal healthcare involve?
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:55.920]   - So there's different varieties.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:58.240]   In the UK, for instance,
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.440]   they have a national health service
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.680]   in which medical personnels and hospitals
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:06.520]   are run directly by the state.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.360]   It's almost like a mini Soviet system, to be honest,
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.640]   but just for healthcare.
[02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:12.120]   And it works pretty well just for healthcare.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:16.120]   And I think it's one example of the way
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:18.080]   in which you could actually take the market.
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.440]   So I give you a vision of socialism
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.840]   that involves a lot of market,
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.240]   but I think there's certain spheres
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.400]   where you could remove the market from
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.760]   and still have an efficient system,
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:32.760]   in part because this is a area in which we,
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:39.280]   people don't have, obviously for cosmetic procedures
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.960]   or whatever, they have preferences,
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.360]   but for most routine things that people do in healthcare,
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:46.760]   they just need to see a doctor.
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.160]   They need to get diagnosed.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.240]   Some of these systems have had trouble
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.960]   with wait lists for specialists or whatever.
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:55.000]   That's more of like an allocation problem of
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.680]   if you want more specialists, you pay specialists more.
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:00.080]   Like this is just problems that could be solved by,
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:03.040]   like through the mechanisms of planning
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:04.840]   and government run healthcare.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:08.240]   So that's kind of the most left wing that you could get
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.360]   is the system in the United Kingdom.
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.240]   Beyond that, you have a system like Medicare for All
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:16.840]   where you say, all right, most of the doctors,
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.880]   besides for public hospitals that already exist,
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.600]   are gonna be privately employed by hospitals.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:26.440]   The hospitals are gonna be private.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.800]   But instead of having all these different insurance carriers
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:34.520]   we're just gonna have one national insurance carrier
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.080]   that we're all gonna pay into.
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:39.840]   That national insurance carrier is going to negotiate
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:41.880]   the price of healthcare with doctors,
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:45.800]   the price of drugs with pharmaceutical companies and so on
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:50.800]   to hopefully reduce prices and to implement
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:54.920]   a different little bit of planning into the system.
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.840]   'Cause if there's only one big national insurance company,
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:02.000]   that company has a lot of weight and power,
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.080]   but you could still visit your same doctor
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:09.440]   and there's still some, it's not as radical
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:11.280]   of a shift in that direction.
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:14.440]   And that's the dominant demand of Bernie Sanders
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.120]   and the left right now.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.520]   There's 30 plus million people in the US
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.000]   that would be insured that currently aren't insured.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.240]   If we move to this system, there's a lot of other people
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:26.760]   that are underinsured or worried about how to pay co-pays
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:28.160]   or premiums involved.
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.720]   I think it would be a net benefit
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:33.040]   for the vast majority of the US population,
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.120]   even if it was offset with certain taxes.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.560]   'Cause we spend a lot of money out of pocket
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.080]   with health insurance.
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.400]   And it's a demand also that's widely popular.
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.200]   So for me, it's almost like if you're trying to build
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.200]   support for something like socialism,
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.120]   we were talking this lofty vision of socialism
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:52.680]   after capitalism or what worker ownership
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.600]   or the means of production would look like in practice
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:55.720]   and so on.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:57.440]   And by the way, you're one of the few interviewers
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.840]   who ever asked me any of the details.
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:02.120]   So it's good that I had, I've been thinking
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:04.080]   of a rough sketch in my head for the last,
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:07.080]   whatever, 16 years I've been a socialist.
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:11.760]   But we have to start in the here and now.
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:15.320]   And if you can't convince people that the state
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:17.760]   should play a bigger role in their health insurance,
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.240]   and you can't convince Americans
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:21.280]   and a whole host of other sectors
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.720]   that they should be living in something closer
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:25.440]   to a social democracy, how are you gonna convince
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:27.160]   those people that there should be worker ownership
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.280]   of the means of production?
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:31.360]   It's kind of a ridiculous leap
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:33.120]   if you don't have the credibility
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:36.600]   as the group of people organizing for universal healthcare,
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.680]   organizing for a $15 minimum wage and able to get the goods.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:44.280]   And also in practice, as we fight for these reforms,
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:47.560]   ordinary people will have a better sense,
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:49.800]   at least my hope is, of what it means
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:53.240]   to be involved with politics and what politics can do
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.280]   for their lives that's positive.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.400]   'Cause right now, when we talk about politics,
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:59.840]   it often just seems that we're talking about
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:05.960]   like a very glib cultural conflict removed
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:08.920]   from the things that are important in our lives.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:11.760]   Whereas in truth, I think politics can be a tool
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.960]   for us to make our lives better.
[02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:17.520]   - Yeah, and there's like deep ideas here
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:19.640]   where in some sense, universal healthcare
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:23.480]   and worker collectives are not so radically different,
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:27.880]   that there's philosophical ideas to explore and accept.
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:30.000]   And also from my perspective, at least,
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.800]   maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.320]   with a lot of things at the core of politics,
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:42.320]   the right answer from an alien perspective is not clear.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:45.600]   Like everybody's very certain of what's the right answer.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.800]   Everyone's certain universal healthcare is terrible
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:49.840]   or in the case of universal healthcare,
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:52.120]   majority of people think it's a good idea,
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:53.680]   but I don't think anyone knows.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:57.520]   'Cause I think that depends on cultural history,
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:59.760]   on the particular dynamics of a country,
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:02.120]   of a political system, on the dynamics
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.200]   of the economic system in this country,
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:06.200]   of the changing world.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.960]   The 21st century is different than the 20th century.
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.000]   Maybe the failures of communism in the 20th century
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.520]   will not be repeated in the 21st century.
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:17.800]   Or the flip side of that, maybe capitalism
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:21.920]   will actually truly flourish with the help of automation
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:23.320]   in the 21st century.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:25.000]   I don't think anyone knows.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.480]   So people like you are basically arguing for ideas
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.780]   and we'll have to explore those ideas together.
[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:36.640]   Why do you think if universal healthcare is popular,
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:41.200]   why don't we have universal healthcare in the United States?
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.840]   - Well, democracy is a great thing.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.520]   Political democracy is wonderful.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.000]   It came from the struggles of ordinary people
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.560]   to expand suffrage and so on.
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:53.600]   But the economic sphere, entrenched power
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:54.800]   in the economic sphere,
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.120]   bleeds into our political democracy.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:59.720]   So I think there's a lot of people with a vested interest
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:01.440]   in not having universal healthcare.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:04.600]   There's large industries with a vested interest
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:07.040]   in not having universal healthcare.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:12.040]   They pay for ads, pay lobbyists, they influence government,
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:13.960]   and they have made it very difficult.
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:17.760]   So you can't get universal healthcare done
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:19.840]   without the bill, even if you pass something
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:20.880]   and you're trying to make a change.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:22.760]   Like Obamacare was supposed to have a public option.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.520]   Everybody's been running on a public option
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.920]   in the Democratic Party for 12, 13 years.
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.160]   Why don't we have a public option?
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.240]   People know that if people have the choice
[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:32.720]   of buying into a government plan,
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.560]   that might be the slow road
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:38.280]   to really having universal healthcare.
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:40.400]   So I think a lot of it's opposition.
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:42.760]   - Do you like that idea, the public option?
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:46.240]   Maybe you can, like, 'cause isn't there complexities,
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:48.200]   like preexisting conditions?
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:54.120]   So isn't a public option mean you can not have any insurance
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.880]   until you get to trouble?
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:59.520]   And then you can, if it covers preexisting conditions,
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:01.160]   just start paying for insurance then.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.280]   Therefore, young people don't pay for insurance.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.880]   Isn't it better to go full in?
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.600]   - I don't support a public option in part
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:10.320]   because I think if we allow politicians
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:12.520]   to just say, "Hey, I support a public option,"
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:15.880]   well, it's just kind of a way to signal your support
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:17.720]   for universal healthcare, but give us nothing.
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.360]   And I think that's what we saw with Biden
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:21.560]   and a lot of other politicians
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:23.880]   that have supported a public option.
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:26.200]   I think in practice, if a public option is defined
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:31.200]   in such a way that it just means you, by default,
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:34.800]   can just opt in to a public plan,
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:35.760]   and let's say, hypothetically,
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.240]   you don't even have to pay for it,
[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:38.480]   then it's just a backdoor
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:40.560]   to universal healthcare really quickly
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:42.440]   'cause I think the vast majority of people
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:43.440]   who aren't currently covered,
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:45.360]   and also a lot of employers, to be honest,
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.400]   would probably drop their private coverage
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.440]   if they knew their employees can just get a public option
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:52.800]   and maybe would only provide supplemental insurance
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:54.080]   or whatever else.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.840]   But I think the broad overarching point
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:00.280]   of all these demands is to say
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:04.320]   that socialists need to be really connected
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.120]   to the day-to-day struggles of people
[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:08.080]   to just improve their lives.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:12.040]   So if you're feeling like you're paying $400, $500
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:14.280]   on the Obamacare market for health insurance,
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:15.720]   and that's hampering your ability
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:17.600]   to do what you wanna do in your life,
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:19.120]   then maybe you would support a candidate
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:21.960]   who's for universal healthcare.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:26.000]   If you feel like you're struggling to find work
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000]   that you could afford to pay your rent with
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:28.840]   or whatever else,
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.800]   maybe you'll support a candidate committed
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.800]   to all sorts of mechanisms to reduce housing prices
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:41.160]   or increase your power as a tenant and whatever else.
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:44.360]   So I think it's like these day-to-day concerns
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.480]   need to be connected to the more abstract
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:48.480]   and lofty vision of change.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.360]   Otherwise, our politics just becomes
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:53.600]   like this fantasy world thing
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:57.760]   that's nice ideas to think about or debate,
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.160]   but really won't make much of a difference in people's lives.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:04.360]   - What do you think about free college?
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:05.560]   Should college be free?
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:09.880]   - So I would say free college is not at the top
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:12.240]   of my list of priorities,
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:13.280]   but it definitely should be free
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.280]   in my vision of a just society.
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:18.520]   - What is at the top, just to clarify,
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:20.320]   is the universal healthcare up there?
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:22.240]   - Yeah, universal healthcare is probably far higher
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.040]   in my priorities than free college.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.200]   I think right now, the way our system is built,
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:28.600]   when someone goes to college,
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.000]   they're given credentials,
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.640]   they're given a decree they carry with them
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:32.640]   for the rest of their life.
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:35.440]   It gives them a chance to join
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:39.280]   kind of a privileged part of the labor market, right?
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:40.400]   It's not a zero-sum game.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:42.680]   I don't want college-educated people
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:45.600]   to think that non-college-educated people
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:47.720]   are their enemies and vice versa,
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:50.080]   'cause a lot of them are just ordinary working-class people
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.520]   trying to survive, and they're in different areas,
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:54.680]   they're in different sectors.
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:57.240]   Some of them are in nursing sectors
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.240]   where they need a college degree and so on.
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:03.920]   But if you just make college tuition free,
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.600]   but you don't also make trade skills and other things free
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:12.440]   for someone to learn how to become an electrician
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:14.760]   or a plumber or whatever else,
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:18.200]   then to some degree, you're privileging one sector
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.960]   of the labor market over another.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.560]   So I would advocate just,
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.080]   if you're gonna make something like that free,
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:26.000]   you just have to make sure
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.960]   that you're doing it in an egalitarian way,
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.440]   and that one, the options, the routes to college
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.240]   are more equal.
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.560]   So there's more investment in K-12 education
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:40.600]   so that more kids in rough neighborhoods
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.480]   have the chance to go to college,
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:44.280]   and for those that choose the trade route
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.200]   from any part of the country,
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.360]   that they're given the skills and resources
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.920]   for vocational trainings, and those are also free.
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:57.240]   And it just feels like, in terms of order of operation,
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:00.240]   I would just start with K-12 education,
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:03.120]   improving it, and whatever else,
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:06.440]   then college after, but I'm not opposed to it.
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:09.200]   - So does that, improving K-12 education,
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.400]   does that mean investing more into it?
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:13.960]   Is it as simple as just increasing the amount of money
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:17.240]   that's invested in public education?
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:19.040]   - In general, when it comes to the public sector
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:21.200]   or any sphere that you're investing in,
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.400]   obviously it's not just as simple
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.080]   as throwing money at a problem.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.800]   I do think we have a lot of schools that are underfunded,
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.040]   but we have other schools that are adequately funded,
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:34.600]   but the conditions in which those schools are,
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:35.720]   like the neighborhoods they're in
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:37.440]   and what's going on in society,
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:40.880]   the problems are so deep that it's impossible
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:42.840]   for just education to solve everything,
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.520]   and I think especially a lot of liberals
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.840]   think that education should be the panacea.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.320]   Invest in education, you'll help people.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:51.800]   If kids are living in poverty,
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.880]   if they go into school hungry or whatever else,
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:58.040]   education's not gonna give them
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:01.640]   everything they need to succeed.
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:03.160]   So sometimes we, I think,
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:06.400]   put too much weight on education.
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.640]   - And of course you could define education more broadly,
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:13.640]   which is like the care of the flourishing of the young mind,
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.840]   whatever that is, whatever you call it.
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:19.640]   - Early, yeah, a lot of it starts with,
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.120]   so New York City at least, we do have universal pre-K,
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:27.360]   so from age three onward, you have the option for that.
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.920]   I mean, it's important for kids' socialization.
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.120]   Their parents are now able to know
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:36.040]   that they could go to work or do something else
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.120]   and have their kids taken care of.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:40.560]   There's a lot of measures like that
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:43.240]   that we could do to equalize things,
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:46.960]   and again, for libertarians in the audience,
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:48.440]   some of this stuff is scary
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:51.400]   because it's obviously more state-involved,
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:53.680]   state-involved in pre-K,
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:56.360]   state is already very involved in K through 12,
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.360]   more investment into state institutions
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.920]   like our state universities and in college,
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:06.120]   but for me, it's not a question of state versus non-state.
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:11.120]   It's a question of good outcomes for people,
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:16.680]   and it just happens to be that for working-class people,
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:19.920]   having the collective power to elect representatives
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:23.680]   that will build a broader safety net is in their interest.
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.880]   For upper-middle-class people, for others,
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:27.880]   they could afford to pay for their own provisioning
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:30.960]   either directly or through Obamacare-like schemes
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:32.080]   where you just get a subsidy
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:34.680]   and you pay the rest yourself and whatever.
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:38.160]   This is for really the bottom 40%-plus of the population.
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:39.480]   They really don't have any options,
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.360]   so they prioritize other things,
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.600]   and they end up with some sort of injury
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:44.960]   or health problem or whatever else,
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.080]   and it's bad for everyone in society,
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:48.400]   but it's especially bad for the people
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.440]   at the bottom of the labor market.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:53.000]   - So I saw various estimates for socialist programs
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.440]   like Social Security expansion, free college,
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.280]   Medicare for All will cost upwards of $40 trillion
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:02.880]   over 10 years for zero.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:05.120]   Okay, they could argue with those numbers and so on,
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:07.360]   but so there's a cost.
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.400]   There's a taxpayer cost.
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:14.400]   What are, given the weight of the cost,
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:16.000]   the weight of that cost,
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.360]   can you still make the case for these programs,
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:22.040]   and then can you try to make the case against them
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:23.560]   that the cost is too high?
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:26.920]   - So I will not argue with you on the numbers
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:28.040]   'cause you just threw out random numbers.
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:30.680]   I do think universal health care, if done right,
[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:32.120]   can be basically cost-neutral.
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:33.560]   I think it's an exception
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:35.680]   because we spend a tremendous amount of money
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:38.600]   on health care, a huge percentage of our GDP,
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:40.240]   so I think it can be done in a way
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:43.240]   that's close to cost-neutral.
[02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:45.840]   - So actually, can you argue on the numbers
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:46.960]   without arguing on the numbers?
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.880]   So you're saying just your gut says
[02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:50.320]   that there's a lot of,
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:52.680]   depending on how these programs are done,
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:55.720]   there's a lot of variance in how much it will actually cost.
[02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:57.360]   - There's a lot of bureaucracy and billing right now
[02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:58.840]   in our health care sector, for example,
[02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:01.300]   that would be eliminated.
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:04.960]   There's a lot of costs that are spiraling upward,
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:07.480]   a provider cost from both doctors, hospitals,
[02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:09.880]   but also pharmaceuticals to drug costs
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:11.880]   that insurance companies shoulder
[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:14.280]   'cause their market share is too fragmented
[02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:16.240]   to really negotiate hard.
[02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:19.840]   Medicare can sometimes negotiate better rates,
[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:21.920]   but a Medicare for all would negotiate even better rates.
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:23.240]   So I think there's a cost spiral
[02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:26.760]   that we can adjust with more government involvement,
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:29.320]   and there's a reason why we spend a bigger share of our GDP
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:32.000]   on health care than other places.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.440]   But let me just accept the broad premise
[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:36.340]   that social programs cost money.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:43.640]   Now, I think that one, for ordinary people,
[02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:47.720]   most of them, the trade-off of,
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:52.240]   even hypothetically, if taxes on lower middle class
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:56.000]   and working class people in certain cases go up,
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.400]   the trade-off would still be in their benefit
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.600]   because they're the ones who currently,
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:03.580]   who would be consuming more of those goods,
[02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:07.760]   and also our tax system and whatnot is progressive.
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:10.760]   So the rich will pay more,
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:14.800]   the majority will consume more of them.
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.520]   Also, I think a lot of these programs
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.680]   are the bedrock of a healthy society.
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:22.320]   So one reason, for example,
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:26.160]   that we have so much crime and violence in the US,
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.440]   there's lots of cultural and other causes
[02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:31.280]   with our level of gun ownership,
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.180]   American history, and so on.
[02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:36.440]   But one really important factor
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:39.720]   is just the level of poverty and inequality in the US
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.360]   compared to other countries
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.360]   that combine with guns and other factors.
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.440]   So we live in more violent, unequal societies.
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:50.320]   A European would be shocked by the fact
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:53.280]   that in even some of our nicest areas,
[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:55.440]   and cities and elsewhere,
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.440]   'cause there's a lot of rural violence too,
[02:32:57.440 --> 02:33:00.480]   it's just normal to have gun violence.
[02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:03.700]   It's normal to have drug-related violence.
[02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:08.240]   We have, what, like 400 or 500 people some years
[02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:12.180]   in Baltimore, a city of under a million getting killed.
[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:15.680]   These are all recipes for a society
[02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:20.400]   in which, one, the public sphere is drunk like crazy
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:22.440]   because you're not gonna go wander out
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:24.040]   for an evening stroll in a park
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:26.760]   if you live in a dangerous area or whatever else.
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:28.600]   The rot goes very deep,
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:30.080]   and a welfare state is one way
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:34.320]   to live in a better society for everyone.
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:36.560]   There's been plenty of studies.
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:38.320]   There's one book called "The Spirit Level"
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:41.480]   on inequality that was quite popular
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:43.860]   that just notes that inequality is really terrible
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:48.860]   for the psyches of the rich too, not just for the poor.
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:51.600]   So I think spending some more money
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.400]   living in a more just society is doable.
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:58.840]   There's different ways to address certain cost spirals.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:00.640]   One reason why our welfare states
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:03.160]   are getting more and more expensive
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:06.640]   is in part just 'cause our population is aging.
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:07.920]   But many of the same people who say
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:11.360]   we can't afford more in our welfare states
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.400]   because we're already spending so much on Social Security
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.900]   and all these other entitlements are the same people.
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:21.900]   Also for, one, closing borders so immigrants can't come in
[02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:27.200]   to help build the economy and to fill gaps in the economy.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.680]   And also who aren't for things
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.440]   that'll make it easier to have kids.
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:33.680]   I'm 33 years old.
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:37.520]   I have a lot of friends who have been putting off
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:40.600]   having kids until they save up X amount of dollars,
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:41.600]   even though they have someone
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:45.260]   they could raise children with,
[02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:48.720]   because they can't afford the cost of childcare.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:51.640]   Their job probably won't give them
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:55.560]   more than four, six weeks of family leave or whatever else.
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:58.000]   This is not the case in other countries.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.840]   So I think there's all sorts of benefits
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:03.480]   from having a bigger welfare state.
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:05.400]   But yes, there are costs
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:07.240]   and there are gonna be certain trade-offs.
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:10.320]   It's not a magical thing where you could just
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:12.360]   have everything without trade-offs.
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.460]   - So in a progressive tax system,
[02:35:14.460 --> 02:35:20.560]   is there, to push back on the costs here,
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.920]   is there a point at which taxing the rich
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.000]   is counterproductive in the long term?
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.080]   So in the short term, there might be a net benefit
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.000]   of increasing taxes, because the programs
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.200]   the middle class, the lower middle class gets
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:37.500]   is more beneficial.
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:42.180]   Is there a negative side to taxing the rich?
[02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:44.280]   - In theory, yes, of course.
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:47.960]   So one would be, if you tax the rich so much,
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:50.240]   they change their consumption patterns
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:53.160]   and that has negative impacts on the economy as a whole.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:56.600]   You would have to kind of really model it out,
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:57.760]   but there would be a certain point
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:00.920]   in which the consumption changes
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:04.240]   might have net detrimental effects.
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:06.600]   I think that's more unlikely.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:10.800]   And the more likely scenario is you tax corporations
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:15.800]   and other wealthy people in society
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:20.560]   to the point that they have potentially less money
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:22.480]   for productive investment,
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:24.200]   'cause you're in a capitalist society,
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:26.940]   so you're relying on capitalists to invest.
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:29.720]   So you kind of don't wanna be in the worst of both worlds
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:31.900]   where you've gone too far for capitalism,
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:33.560]   but not far enough for socialism.
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.460]   In my vision, of course, of socialism,
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.260]   that's one reason why we'd have to take
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:42.480]   the investment function away from capitalists.
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:45.680]   There has to be, if you're gonna make it so hard for them
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:48.840]   that they can't invest or they can't employ labor
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:50.160]   the way they're employing now,
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.320]   you have to create another mechanism
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.080]   for supply to be created.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.600]   And that's why, that's a transition point.
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:36:57.440]   - Yeah.
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:01.800]   - What about longer term, de-incentivizing young people
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:04.920]   that are dreaming of becoming entrepreneurs
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:08.680]   and realizing that there's this huge tax on being wealthy?
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:10.400]   So if you take these big risks,
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:13.280]   which is what's required to be an entrepreneur,
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:15.600]   and you are lucky enough to succeed
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:17.680]   and good enough to succeed,
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:20.380]   that the government will take most of your money away?
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:22.200]   - I think realistically,
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:24.820]   that's not a disincentive for most people.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:27.440]   First of all, we already have
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:29.480]   a progressive taxation system.
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.080]   The government does take a bunch of the money away
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:35.000]   and people are still striving to become rich.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.920]   A lot of what people want when they dream of success
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:41.400]   is they want accolades, they want respect,
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.960]   and of course they want some more wealth.
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:49.840]   Wealth to consume luxury goods with or whatever else.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:54.200]   But at a certain point, it becomes better for the state
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:58.920]   to tax and either redistribute directly
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:00.720]   or through social programs,
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:04.480]   or redirect that money through tax credits
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.560]   and other ways to shape investment
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.960]   towards productive investment.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:11.040]   We don't want a society in which a bunch of rich people
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.440]   fly around in helicopters going from club to club
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:17.920]   while the productive economy kind of does nothing.
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:21.040]   At that point, I think a lot of ordinary rich people
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.240]   might prefer the government to come in to tax them
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:29.600]   and to try to spur investment in certain productive sectors.
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:32.400]   So it really just depends.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:36.280]   But I honestly believe that most people
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:37.940]   don't necessarily wanna be rich
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.560]   for the sake of being rich.
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:40.880]   They wanna be successful
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:42.960]   and there's many different dynamics to that.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:45.680]   And accolades and social respect
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.320]   is an important one of them.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.920]   It's also why people who just become filthy rich often,
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:55.680]   the first thing they do is start out philanthropic trusts
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:56.760]   and try to give away their money
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:59.040]   because they want the social respect and accolades
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:00.000]   and whatever else.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.740]   They don't want just their money.
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:06.040]   - On that topic, sort of a little bit of a tangent.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:10.320]   There's a lot of folks in the left community,
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:13.480]   far left community, socialist community
[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:15.520]   that I think are at the source
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:20.480]   of a kind of derision towards the B word, the billionaires.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.720]   Does it bother you?
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:24.760]   Or do you think that's in part justified?
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:28.760]   A kind of using the word billionaire as a dirty word?
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:30.040]   - I think it's perfectly justified
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:32.960]   in that it's a populist shorthand, right?
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:35.360]   So obviously when I talk about inequality,
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.760]   I often talk about power dynamics, right?
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.640]   Between workers and bosses and so on.
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.400]   Billionaire is just the 99, 1% version of it.
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:49.440]   It's just a populist shorthand to just explain the fact
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:53.600]   that there's a lot of people
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.520]   who have accumulated obscene wealth.
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:02.520]   These people aren't in my mind, parasites,
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:07.520]   in the kind of very, very old school socialist rhetoric.
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:13.120]   And that of course, capitalists provide employment,
[02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:16.600]   take entrepreneurial risks,
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:18.440]   come up with new ideas sometimes themselves,
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:23.100]   like sometimes directly manage work and whatever else.
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:28.280]   But they exert so much power over the lives
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:31.840]   of not just their workers, but society as a whole.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.640]   Taking away some of their wealth and power
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:37.660]   is a way to just empower others.
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:42.240]   And again, these things have policy trade-offs.
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:45.960]   If you just snap your fingers and say,
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.640]   Elon Musk, all your wealth is gone,
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:53.160]   you're now on food stamps or whatever else
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.760]   in that kind of arbitrary way,
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:57.380]   you'd be a totally disincentivized people
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:40:59.440]   from trusting the rules of the game
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:01.560]   as they've been set up in a capitalist society.
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.200]   And I think that would have negative consequences
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.320]   for workers.
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.400]   But saying that, hey, this person has too much power
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:10.740]   and too much wealth and has too much ability
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:13.920]   to dictate things about the lives of others,
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:16.740]   I think is just simply a fact.
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:20.080]   And I think it's true in the cases of people
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.080]   who are good people and have risen to this position.
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:24.440]   And it's true in the cases of people
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:26.360]   who are maybe not so good people
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:28.560]   and who have risen to these positions.
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:31.840]   - So I agree with you in part, but I have to push back here.
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:35.640]   So one of the problems I see is using billionaires
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:38.520]   as shorthand to talk about power inequality
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:39.900]   and wealth inequality.
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:45.360]   Often dismisses the fact that some of these folks
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:48.860]   are some of the best members of our society.
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:51.820]   So outside of the, however the system
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:55.500]   has created inequalities, a young person today
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:42:01.140]   should dream to build cool stuff, not for the wealth,
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:04.340]   not for the power, the fame,
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:07.260]   but to be part of building cool stuff.
[02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:09.340]   Now there's a lot of examples of billionaires
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:12.620]   that have gotten there in shady ways and so on.
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:14.100]   And you can point that out.
[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:18.260]   But in the same way we celebrate great artists
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:22.980]   and great athletes and great literary icons
[02:42:22.980 --> 02:42:25.940]   and sort of writers and poets and musicians
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:28.540]   and engineers and scientists,
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:33.540]   we should sort of separate the human creator
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:37.080]   from the wealth that the system has given them.
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:42.520]   That's what I worry about is like in our system,
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:45.420]   some of the greatest humans are the ones
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:46.300]   that have become rich.
[02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:48.980]   And so we sometimes mix up the,
[02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:52.720]   if you want to criticize the wealth,
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:56.460]   we sometimes criticize the human and the creator
[02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:59.500]   while that should actually be the person we aspire to be.
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:02.580]   - So I would agree with that.
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:05.820]   LeBron James, if he's not already in his lifetime,
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:06.880]   will be a billionaire.
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.700]   And he got his money largely through
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:13.300]   just being an incredible athlete,
[02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:16.720]   excelling in his field more than anyone,
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:17.780]   besides for Michael Jordan.
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:18.700]   I think he's my number two.
[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:19.860]   He might be my number one.
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:21.140]   We'll see.
[02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:23.340]   Yeah, I'm willing to keep an open mind
[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:26.340]   about the LeBron versus Jordan conversation.
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:31.340]   But he got that through his merit and he's been rewarded.
[02:43:31.340 --> 02:43:33.980]   And in part he's getting rewarded
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:35.860]   because he's created vast amounts of wealth
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:36.760]   beyond what he's getting.
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.900]   This is just his share.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:39.640]   He's in a salary cap league.
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:41.380]   Whenever he's doing an endorsement,
[02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:44.300]   obviously that company is thinking that he's worth more
[02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:47.440]   than what they're paying him for that endorsement and so on.
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:50.200]   And to the extent with Elon Musk,
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:53.360]   people see innovation and they see someone
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:58.200]   who will put himself out there with sometimes crazy ideas
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:00.720]   because he's trying to think about the future
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.680]   and trying to just push things forward
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:05.680]   instead of just sitting on whatever money he has now
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.760]   and just investing it, earning 6% return
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:11.600]   for the rest of his life.
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:14.120]   I think that that's a positive thing.
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:17.860]   But I think it doesn't get to the broader policy question.
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:19.240]   When people invoke billionaires,
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:22.700]   they're invoking the specter of inequality and power.
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:27.640]   It's not normally the rhetoric that I use
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:30.840]   'cause I propose and I use more traditional
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.840]   socialist rhetoric and terms.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.560]   But I think it gets at something real.
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:39.560]   So often with these sorts of shorthands we use in politics,
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:47.440]   they're imperfect, but they speak to a real thing.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:49.960]   - Yeah, and they feed a little bit of fun
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:52.600]   that folks like AOC and Elon have with each other.
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:53.440]   Great.
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:56.840]   It inspires, it serves as a catalyst
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:59.960]   for productive discourse.
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:01.460]   Okay, speaking of which,
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:04.120]   you said you're a fan of Bernie Sanders.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:05.840]   Would you classify yourself as a Bernie bro?
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:07.600]   What's the technical definition of a Bernie bro?
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:09.200]   Is that a very, it's a subset?
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:10.200]   No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:14.720]   You're a sophisticated philosopher, writer,
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:16.280]   economic and political thinker.
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:18.160]   Of course you would not call yourself a Bernie bro.
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.600]   - I'm fine with calling myself a Bernie bro.
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:22.320]   'Cause it was made up by liberal journalists
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:24.680]   to smear Bernie and his supporters
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.960]   during the 2016 campaign,
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:31.120]   even though disproportionately his supporters
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.120]   were young women in their 20s.
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:39.120]   But whatever, I think I'll ride for Bernie.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:41.320]   There's worse things in the world than being called a bro.
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:42.400]   So it's fine.
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:44.640]   - What do you like about Bernie Sanders
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:48.220]   and to what degree does he represent ideas of socialism?
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:52.040]   To what degree does he represent
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:54.560]   the more traditional sort of liberal ideas?
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.620]   - I love Bernie.
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:58.360]   Most of all, I like his clarity.
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:01.600]   He's by far the best communicator we have on the left.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:04.880]   He speaks with a moral force.
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:06.680]   He's relatable.
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:11.600]   And he has taken a lot of socialist rhetoric from academia
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:13.440]   and brought it down to its core
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:15.600]   in a way that's comprehensible for ordinary people
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:17.720]   and speaks to their daily lives.
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:19.040]   So when Bernie does a speech,
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:20.360]   people can finish his lines
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.120]   'cause they know what he's gonna say.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.720]   They know what points he's gonna hit.
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:27.920]   Because socialism, in my mind,
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:29.560]   should not be a complicated thing.
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:31.800]   Now, when we get to more abstract discussions
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:33.760]   about what a future system would look like,
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:35.600]   when we get to the policy trade-offs today,
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:37.620]   I think we need to put on a different hat.
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:41.120]   We should embrace all sorts of nuance
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:43.360]   and contradiction and complication.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:46.860]   When it comes to the core moral and ethical appeal,
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:50.880]   I think Bernie grasps that and how to communicate it.
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:54.520]   Now, Bernie Sanders was politicized
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:56.200]   a very long time ago.
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:58.760]   I actually once told him, I've only met him a few times,
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:02.980]   but one time I joked that in his book,
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:06.640]   he mentioned that one politicizing moment in his life
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:10.320]   was when the Brooklyn Dodgers left town
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.680]   and he was devastated 'cause he was a Dodgers fan
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:13.800]   from Brooklyn.
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.160]   And I said, this is like 2020 campaign, this may be 2019.
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:18.480]   I said, Bernie, you're running for president.
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:20.640]   You do not need to keep reminding people of your age.
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:22.600]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:27.200]   - But he was politicized
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.960]   through the Young People's Socialist League,
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.280]   which was an old offshoot
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.440]   of the Norm Thomas Socialist Party of America.
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:36.120]   So very old school socialist tradition.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:39.920]   Then he was engaged in labor struggles in the '60s.
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:42.120]   He was engaged in the civil rights movement.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:45.880]   So he came from this old left generation
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:48.200]   that I think just had a more plain spoken,
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:51.640]   more rooted way of understanding change and socialism.
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:54.720]   It wasn't in my mind polluted by academia
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:59.120]   and by some of the turn towards issues of culture
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:02.640]   and excessive focus on representation or whatever else.
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:06.440]   It was really rooted in something economic in a way.
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.360]   Then obviously he had all his ideas
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:10.960]   and he was also a product of the left
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.340]   in that he went to Vermont.
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:14.160]   He kind of did the back to the land thing.
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:17.400]   He was basically like not quite a hippie and an affect,
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:20.440]   but he was out there trying to farm or whatever.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:24.600]   And cold as hell, Northern Vermont.
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:29.600]   And then he decided to do politics, do electoral politics.
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:30.880]   And he failed for a long time.
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:32.160]   He did third party politics.
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:33.800]   He kept losing races.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:37.720]   Eventually he became by savvy and luck and things he learned
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:40.120]   the mayor of Burlington, Vermont.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.640]   And he just kept with the same message.
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:45.480]   And in my book, I talk about,
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:49.840]   I quote, I think a Bernie speech from the 1970s,
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.240]   one of his early campaigns.
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:54.240]   And I compared it to a Bernie speech
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:55.880]   during his 2016 campaign.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.640]   It was virtually identical.
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:00.280]   Millionaires were swapped with millionaires and billionaires
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:02.860]   speaking of billionaires, which is beautiful.
[02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:06.560]   I think there's something great
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.360]   to what he offered American politics.
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:09.960]   And also all around the world,
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:11.960]   there's a socialist poll in politics,
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:13.320]   whether you agree with it or not.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.760]   And all these countries in Europe and any rich country,
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:18.280]   Japan and so on.
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:19.640]   And the US really didn't have that.
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:22.160]   The furthest left you could go was like,
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:24.980]   Chris Hayes and MSNBC or whatever.
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:29.720]   I'm very glad that there's a socialist poll.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.360]   And I think we have Bernie to thank for it.
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:36.660]   To the extent that a lot of self-described socialists
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:38.680]   don't think Bernie is a real socialist.
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:40.840]   It's in part because he stays grounded
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:43.320]   in people's day-to-day lives and struggles.
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:47.360]   I don't think he thinks often the way that I do
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:49.880]   and other people more disconnected or step or move
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:51.680]   from day-to-day politics.
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.140]   Think about the future contours of a socialist society
[02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:56.980]   and so on.
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:58.900]   But I think he's morally committed
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:03.080]   to a egalitarian different sort of future.
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:06.320]   - And I don't think he, at least I haven't heard him
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:09.640]   talk about sort of this big, broad history and future.
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:12.280]   So the Marxist ideology and so on.
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:13.640]   Not that he's afraid of it or something.
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:15.280]   It's just not how he thinks about it.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:17.200]   - Yeah, I think he's a practical thinker
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:18.280]   and also, yeah, he is running.
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:20.920]   Even if he, he should be afraid of it too
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:25.640]   because he is a major politician running for president.
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:28.640]   I think what people want is they want,
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:32.760]   they want the left wing of the possible.
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:34.800]   And I, or at least the segment of the party
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:35.640]   that was voting for him,
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:37.360]   the Democratic Party that was voting for him.
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:40.400]   They wanted something that was a step or two removed
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:43.200]   from what they had now and was visionary.
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:46.960]   But not so far removed that it seemed like a scary leap.
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.080]   And I think we lost a chance in 2016
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.440]   to elect someone that I think would have beaten Trump
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:58.360]   or at the very least would have been close.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:01.120]   - Do you think the Democrats screwed him over?
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:04.740]   - Yes, not in the way of deliberate or direct vote rigging,
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:08.840]   but they put their thumb on the scale for sure.
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:11.380]   I mean, there's, it's not even conspiracy theory.
[02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:14.960]   There's all this stuff in the debates about Clinton,
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.600]   you know, being Clinton's people being fed questions
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:18.680]   and whatever else.
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.120]   And just the tone of the media,
[02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:23.840]   the media was extremely dismissive and hostile to him.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:26.880]   I love that Bernie still does the Fox News town hall
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:29.520]   with his, they're just him speaking to the people
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:32.360]   and he's not afraid of going on, you know,
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:35.960]   any sort of outlet and making his case.
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:39.520]   But I think a lot of the liberal media in particular
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:41.400]   always had it out for Bernie Sanders.
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:43.800]   - What was the, 'cause that was really annoying.
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:46.720]   That was really annoying how dismissive they were.
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:48.560]   I've seen that in some other candidates,
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:52.160]   like they were dismissive towards Andrew Yang
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.000]   in that same way.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.900]   So forget the ideology.
[02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:58.800]   Why are they so smug sometimes towards certain candidates?
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:51:59.620]   What is that?
[02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:02.200]   'Cause I think that's actually at the core to a degree
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:06.640]   if Democrats or any party fails, that it's that smugness.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:08.600]   'Cause people see through that.
[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:10.920]   - I think a lot of these people are friends,
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:12.520]   even if they don't know each other, they're friends
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:15.160]   'cause they went to the same schools.
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:16.520]   They know the same people.
[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:20.200]   They have the same broad just ideology and worldview.
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:22.560]   So they had a sense of what the Democratic Party should be
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:25.240]   and who should be running and who is gonna win
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:28.000]   and also what was serious and unserious.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.920]   So Bernie would say some things about the world
[02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:34.760]   that objectively to a lot of people seemed correct
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:37.420]   or at least pretty close to correct.
[02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:38.840]   And a journalist would just look at him
[02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:40.160]   like he was from outer space.
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:43.440]   To some extent, this also happens to people on the right.
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:48.080]   People on the right often say things that I find repulsive
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:53.080]   or just wrong, but there's parts of the media
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:57.360]   that would describe their certain views as illegitimate
[02:52:57.360 --> 02:53:00.880]   or outside this boundaries of acceptable conversation.
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:03.440]   I think there should be a few things outside the boundary
[02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:08.080]   of acceptable conversation, hate speech and so on.
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.440]   But like there's this attempt to say
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:13.680]   their views are illegitimate
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:15.120]   and therefore anyone who votes for them
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:17.300]   for any reason is illegitimate too.
[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:19.120]   And that's one reason why I think it's fueled
[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:22.960]   a lot of resentment and ultimately end up fueling
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:25.720]   the extremes of American politics
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.000]   and people feel like they're not being listened to.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.920]   - Yeah, and some of it is also style of speaking
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:35.000]   and personality, where if you're not willing
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:38.480]   to sort of play kind of a game of civility,
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:40.640]   or there's like a proper way of speaking
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:42.880]   if you're a Democrat, if you're not doing
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:45.600]   that kind of proper way of speaking, people dismiss you.
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:49.460]   I think in certain sense, whatever you feel about him,
[02:53:49.460 --> 02:53:52.400]   people dismiss Donald Trump for the same reason,
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:54.980]   where it's the style of speaking,
[02:53:54.980 --> 02:53:56.560]   the personality of the person,
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.280]   that he's not playing by the rules of polite society,
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:03.640]   of polite politician society and so on.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:06.280]   And that's really, that troubles me
[02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:08.440]   because it feels like solutions,
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:13.440]   the great leaders will not be polite.
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:16.200]   In the way, they're not going to behave
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:18.360]   in the way they're supposed to behave.
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:21.680]   And I just wish the media was at least open-minded to that.
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:25.100]   Like, which I guess gives me hope about the new media,
[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:28.240]   which is like more distributed citizen media, right?
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:31.100]   That they're more open-minded to the revolutionary,
[02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:34.940]   to the outsiders, right?
[02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:39.160]   I actually first, I really like Bernie Sanders.
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:45.320]   I first heard him in conversation with Tom Hartman.
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:50.480]   He had these like weekly conversations
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.400]   and just the authenticity from the guy,
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:54.800]   I didn't even know any context.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:55.820]   I didn't even know, honestly,
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:57.800]   he was a Democratic socialist or anything.
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:00.600]   The authenticity of the human being was really refreshing.
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.100]   And when he, I guess, decided to run for president,
[02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:05.500]   that was really strange.
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:09.420]   I was like, surely this kind of, this person has no chance.
[02:55:09.420 --> 02:55:11.340]   Just like he seemed too authentic.
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:15.100]   He seemed too, like he's not going to be effective
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:16.380]   at playing the game of politics.
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:18.460]   So it was very inspiring to me to see that
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:19.740]   you don't necessarily need to be good
[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:21.540]   at playing the game of politics.
[02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:23.380]   You can actually have a chance of winning.
[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:25.340]   Yeah, that was really inspiring to see.
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:31.880]   What about some of the other popular candidates?
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:33.960]   What do you think about AOC?
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:36.760]   I don't know if she self-identifies as a socialist or not.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.760]   She does self-identify as a democratic socialist.
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:43.200]   I think she was a very inspiring figure
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.440]   for a lot of people.
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:47.720]   She was kind of out of this Bernie wave
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:50.800]   of the first set of Bernie candidates in 2018
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:51.840]   that identified with him
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:54.920]   instead of the Democratic Party establishment.
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:59.540]   I think that she's still developing as a politician.
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:03.980]   And it's very difficult when you're in a deep blue district
[02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:08.980]   and when you don't often have to worry about re-election
[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:13.740]   or talk to, but modulate your rhetoric
[02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:15.860]   to win over swing voters in your district,
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:19.340]   but then you're immediately a national and cultural figure.
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:23.340]   So AOC basically goes from her views,
[02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:25.280]   which are compelling in my mind,
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:28.360]   a lot of her programmatic views are compelling,
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:31.600]   wins her district, and then has her own rhetoric,
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.020]   which to me, compared to Bernie,
[02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:36.960]   owes itself more to the academic left
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:40.040]   and the way that a lot of the left has learned to talk.
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:41.080]   I don't mean academic in the sense
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:42.960]   that she's a Marxist or whatever else,
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:47.960]   but academic in the way that she may be using at times
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.680]   confusing language to convey basic points
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:55.060]   when she gets into the language of intersectionality
[02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:56.340]   and whatever else.
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:56:58.700]   - Especially in the context of cultural issues
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:56:59.540]   and stuff like that.
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:01.420]   - Exactly, instead of just a plain spoken Bernie,
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:03.380]   like yeah, discrimination is wrong.
[02:57:03.380 --> 02:57:04.660]   If you ask me about a cultural issue,
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:06.620]   I'll come down on the same side as AOC,
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:11.220]   I'm sure nine times out of 10,
[02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:14.300]   but I'll try to root it into just basic,
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:16.580]   like yeah, treat people with respect,
[02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:17.820]   and they'll treat you with respect,
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:20.380]   and that's the way we should govern our civic sphere.
[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:23.260]   And we don't need to talk about intersectionality
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:24.900]   to I think get that.
[02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:28.140]   So there's that rhetoric.
[02:57:28.140 --> 02:57:30.340]   But she's not just a regular congressperson
[02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:31.340]   in a deep blue district,
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:34.700]   she's also a national and international,
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:36.500]   cultural and political figure.
[02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:38.860]   So she's now a spokesperson
[02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:40.660]   because of largely like a media event
[02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:43.460]   of her surprising upset election
[02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:48.140]   and her being young and being really connected
[02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:50.900]   to this post-Bernie moment.
[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:54.500]   And I think amid these constant attacks on her
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:57.820]   from the right and also this media attention
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:57:59.920]   and this notoriety,
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.280]   she hasn't really modulated or adjusted her audience,
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:07.100]   her rhetoric, and how do you win over someone
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:10.600]   who really hates a lot of your ideas
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.800]   but might actually believe in some of your policies?
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:19.740]   And I think she's been ineffective, quite frankly,
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:22.900]   in the last year making that transition.
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:25.740]   Whereas I think other politicians who are not so far left
[02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:28.020]   who don't identify as socialists,
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:29.540]   but let's say a John Fetterman,
[02:58:29.540 --> 02:58:31.940]   has managed to become more effective.
[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:33.620]   And I don't think it's a question of character
[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:34.740]   or whatever else.
[02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:38.600]   And I like AOC, so I don't wanna put it so harshly.
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:39.780]   But I think a lot of it has to do
[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:42.900]   with her being a congressperson in a deep blue district
[02:58:42.900 --> 02:58:46.020]   and Fetterman running for statewide office
[02:58:46.020 --> 02:58:49.080]   in a quote unquote purple state.
[02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:53.820]   But at her best, she does it, but it's like glimmers.
[02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:55.820]   It's kind of like, I don't know,
[02:58:55.820 --> 02:58:57.500]   what sport are you biggest fan of?
[02:58:57.500 --> 02:58:59.500]   I'll give you a sports analogy.
[02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.380]   - I like the NFL.
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:03.340]   I mean, NFL is up there, soccer is up there,
[02:59:03.340 --> 02:59:04.780]   but probably UFC.
[02:59:04.780 --> 02:59:06.620]   - Okay, well, I can't give you a good analogy
[02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:09.560]   for any of those, but it's like a raw prospect.
[02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:12.840]   Like someone who shows glimmers of hope,
[02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.440]   so they were drafted really high
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:15.920]   and then they bounce from team to team.
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:18.720]   And you're like, I'm clinging on to my AOC stock,
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:23.720]   but I think that she needs to be self-critical enough
[02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:25.380]   and her team needs to be self-critical enough
[02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:27.160]   to know that the goal is not merely
[02:59:27.160 --> 02:59:30.200]   to be a national cultural figure
[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:32.220]   and win a re-election in your deep blue district.
[02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:33.760]   The goal has to be to become
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:36.120]   truly a national political figure,
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:38.800]   which will require changes.
[02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:41.720]   - A unifier and inspiring figure
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:43.760]   about the ideas that she represents.
[02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:45.680]   - Definitely, and she has other things against her.
[02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:47.600]   Like I'm obviously class focused,
[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:49.640]   but there's no denying, I think,
[02:59:49.640 --> 02:59:52.440]   that some of the hostility to her is like sexism.
[02:59:52.440 --> 02:59:53.480]   You know, it's rooted in, I think,
[02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:56.840]   people wanting to see her fail or whatever else,
[02:59:56.840 --> 02:59:58.120]   but that's only some of it.
[02:59:58.120 --> 02:59:59.800]   You know, I think some of it otherwise
[02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:02.840]   is her struggling to relate to people
[03:00:02.840 --> 03:00:05.720]   who don't have a lot of her, you know,
[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:08.560]   starting points as far as moral and ethical beliefs.
[03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:12.040]   - Yeah, but she's actually great at flourishing
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:15.280]   in all the attacks she's getting.
[03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:16.920]   She's doing a good job with that.
[03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:18.640]   And a lot of those attacks would break me,
[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:19.880]   if I'm being honest.
[03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:21.040]   - Yes, that's fantastic.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:22.980]   - The amount of fire she's under.
[03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:26.560]   But you don't want that to become a drug
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:29.520]   to where you just get good at being a national figure
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:31.280]   that's constantly in the fights
[03:00:31.280 --> 03:00:33.240]   and are using that for attention and so on.
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:35.000]   You still wanna be the unifier.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:36.680]   And that's the trickiest switch.
[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:39.360]   Do you think there's a chance there's a world
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:42.240]   in which she's able to modulate it enough
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:44.440]   to be a unifier and run for president?
[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:47.400]   And win?
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:51.080]   - I think she's very far away from being able to do that.
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:55.420]   I think that even other politicians
[03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:58.600]   that are also polarizing within the squad
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:00.400]   in terms of what they say or their ideas,
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:03.640]   whatever else, are very effective communicators,
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:05.140]   like Ilhan Omar and others.
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:09.960]   I think AOC, I mean, that's my hope, right?
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:13.600]   My hope is that someone like AOC could.
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:18.600]   The last year plus has not been extremely promising
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:21.560]   in my mind, in part because she's become,
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:23.400]   or she's continued to position herself
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:27.460]   as a lightning rod cultural figure.
[03:01:27.460 --> 03:01:31.280]   Whereas I think a national political figure
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:35.320]   needs to pick their spots and also pick their moment
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:39.520]   for changing their rhetoric and adjusting to their audience.
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:41.320]   And I think she does it in certain environments,
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:43.560]   but that needs to be your national message
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:45.280]   when you're out there.
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:50.280]   You need to be speaking towards the not already converted.
[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:51.660]   And I think Bernie does that.
[03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:54.500]   Bernie strips his politics down to the basics.
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:58.760]   - So I agree with you spiritually,
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:01.960]   but we also have an example of Donald Trump
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:03.260]   winning the presidency.
[03:02:03.260 --> 03:02:08.880]   Isn't some of the game of politics
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:11.680]   that's separate from the policy,
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:16.680]   being able to engage in rhetoric that leads to outrage
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:19.240]   and then walking through that fire with grace?
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:21.940]   - First of all, I think Trump
[03:02:21.940 --> 03:02:24.760]   is kind of a unique personality in American history.
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:29.760]   So it's hard to compare anyone to Trump.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:32.400]   - But don't you think AOC is comparable
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:34.460]   in terms of the uniqueness
[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:36.880]   in the political system we're in or no?
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:40.320]   - I think Trump is much more of a firebrand
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:44.840]   anti-establishment force in that,
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:46.760]   and I mean this negatively for what it's worth,
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:49.040]   because I disagree with Trump,
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:50.720]   but he was willing to set fire
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:55.480]   to the Republican establishment, right?
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:02:58.160]   He was able to self-fund largely his campaign
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:01.080]   and he already was a media figure without them.
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:03.400]   AOC has been much more cautious
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:05.120]   for the Democratic Party establishment
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:06.880]   in part because she's not trying to run
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.200]   a national political campaign right now for the outside,
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:11.760]   like a 5% chance they're gonna be president,
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:13.160]   let me set fire to everything.
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:16.340]   She's trying to help people and help her constituents
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:18.880]   through the game of getting committee appointments
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:21.800]   and getting wins in the margins.
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:25.040]   And I think that's understandable for what it's worth.
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:28.200]   But in the process, I think what's the difference
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:32.000]   between AOC and a progressive Democrat?
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.120]   During 2016, it used to be pretty easy to say
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:35.400]   the difference between the Berniecrats
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:37.000]   and a progressive Democrat, right?
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.960]   'Cause we were establishing our own outside third force
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:44.360]   in American politics where you could knock on the door
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:46.160]   of a lot of people who would end up voting for Trump
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:47.760]   and they would say, "Oh, I have a lot of respect
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:49.440]   "for Bernie," or whatever.
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:51.400]   They were still gonna not vote for him.
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:53.880]   But he wasn't considered part
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:56.300]   of the Democratic Party milieu.
[03:03:56.300 --> 03:04:01.480]   I think now with AOC, there's a much closer association
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:06.120]   of AOC in our policies with ordinary Democrats
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:08.600]   where she needs to draw stronger distinctions.
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:10.840]   She doesn't need to do it like Trump did
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:12.800]   with just, man, I forgot all of them,
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:14.520]   though I found some of them amusing in the moment,
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:17.080]   like all his nicknames about, oh, Ryan Ted Cruz
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:18.580]   and then the rest, you know?
[03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:23.720]   But I do feel like she needs to, yes,
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:25.860]   differentiate herself a bit more,
[03:04:25.860 --> 03:04:29.000]   but then also just keep her language simple.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:34.000]   Trump was more complex than Bernie in his literal language,
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:38.360]   but he was repetitive and there was kind of a rhythm
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:40.280]   and a cadence to Trump's speech.
[03:04:40.280 --> 03:04:43.080]   I think AOC needs to, like Bernie,
[03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:47.200]   reduce her rhetoric down to a couple key lines
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:50.920]   and signatures and focus her politics not on 20 issues,
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:53.560]   but on three or four most important issues
[03:04:53.560 --> 03:04:55.480]   and have that message discipline.
[03:04:55.480 --> 03:04:58.960]   Bernie will do an interview with you and he'll write down,
[03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:00.400]   hope you do interview Bernie,
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:04.480]   but he'll write down like five things.
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:05.600]   And I'm like, yeah, I'm only gonna talk
[03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:06.720]   about these five things.
[03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:07.720]   You ask me about this?
[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:09.160]   Okay, I'm talking about these five things.
[03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:10.500]   - So that's a message discipline
[03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:14.240]   that Bernie has been exemplary on, yeah, for sure.
[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:15.880]   But I think that's learned, that could be developed.
[03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:17.080]   - I think she could develop it.
[03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:19.200]   Listen, I hope, I'm answering your question,
[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:21.360]   I think not the way I should answer it,
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:26.360]   being someone broadcasting to people on the left
[03:05:26.360 --> 03:05:30.580]   and elsewhere.
[03:05:30.580 --> 03:05:33.760]   I hope AOC goes in that direction.
[03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:36.880]   I just think that she has a lot going against her
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:41.120]   just 'cause she's already a national figure
[03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:43.440]   and she's in a deeper blue district.
[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:45.800]   But we need to root our politics then
[03:05:45.800 --> 03:05:48.400]   in working class people and a lot of districts
[03:05:48.400 --> 03:05:52.960]   that I don't know, the type of kitchen table conversations
[03:05:52.960 --> 03:05:55.260]   are, I hate that cliche, but I just used it.
[03:05:55.260 --> 03:05:58.200]   But a lot of these conversations are just different
[03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:00.300]   in their tone and cadence.
[03:06:00.300 --> 03:06:02.420]   And it's not just a question of,
[03:06:02.420 --> 03:06:05.320]   Fetterman or Tim Ryan in Ohio
[03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:07.320]   and kind of just white working class voters.
[03:06:07.320 --> 03:06:09.360]   I mean, working class voters of any race.
[03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:13.300]   Their day-to-day needs and the day-to-day things
[03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:17.460]   they wanna talk about is just at a different plane
[03:06:17.460 --> 03:06:22.460]   than a Met Gala cultural statement.
[03:06:22.460 --> 03:06:25.080]   - Yeah, I mean, it's clear that you respect and love her
[03:06:25.080 --> 03:06:28.560]   and would like to see different ways.
[03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:30.800]   I mean, she's young, so the different trajectories
[03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:33.500]   that she could develop that would ultimately
[03:06:33.500 --> 03:06:34.400]   make her a good candidate.
[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:36.600]   I'm just looking at odds here for,
[03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:37.640]   and I disagree with them.
[03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:40.800]   I'm buying AOC stock here, given these odds.
[03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:43.860]   So in terms of Democratic,
[03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:46.000]   who's gonna win the 2024 election?
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.300]   So that includes running and winning.
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:51.920]   On the Democrat side is 18% chance for Biden,
[03:06:51.920 --> 03:06:54.720]   so 7% chance for Kamala Harris,
[03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:56.680]   Gavin Newsom at 6%,
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:59.560]   Michelle Obama at 3%,
[03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:04.200]   Hillary Clinton at 2% and AOC at 1.5%.
[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:05.880]   And then Bernie at 1%.
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:07.320]   So--
[03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:09.040]   - I would not buy AOC at that mark.
[03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:11.360]   I would buy Biden like crazy though.
[03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:12.520]   I'm not a gambling man,
[03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:17.520]   but I would totally toss a G at Biden at that amount.
[03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:19.960]   - AOC at 1.5% chance?
[03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:23.120]   - I think it's, I don't think she runs.
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:25.400]   - You don't think she runs, yeah, okay.
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:27.800]   - I don't think Bernie will primary Biden either.
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:29.900]   I mean, if Biden doesn't run,
[03:07:29.900 --> 03:07:31.200]   then obviously it's an open field.
[03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:33.040]   But I just feel like--
[03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:34.800]   - Do you think Biden runs?
[03:07:34.800 --> 03:07:37.540]   - Yes, I think Biden probably runs.
[03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:40.600]   - Oh man, oh boy.
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:42.880]   - He's an incumbent president.
[03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:44.520]   So it's just, it's very hard to imagine
[03:07:44.520 --> 03:07:47.320]   another Democrat being able to do better than him.
[03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:50.560]   - All right, what about the competition?
[03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:52.780]   - I think Donald Trump is the best thing
[03:07:52.780 --> 03:07:54.800]   for the Democrats, period.
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:07:57.080]   Just 'cause it would create this turnout mechanism,
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:00.200]   this excitement around, we have to stop Donald Trump.
[03:08:00.200 --> 03:08:01.620]   He's attacking DeSantis.
[03:08:01.620 --> 03:08:04.360]   I mean, already he's trying to,
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:06.860]   the sanctimonious thing.
[03:08:06.860 --> 03:08:11.360]   But yeah, I kind of like, yeah,
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:14.160]   Trump's kind of like the Don King of American politics.
[03:08:14.160 --> 03:08:18.400]   - Yeah, it's interesting what kind of
[03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:20.400]   dynamic chaos he's created.
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:26.440]   It probably led to more people being interested in politics.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:28.760]   Well, almost guaranteed it led to more people
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:29.800]   being interested in politics,
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:32.120]   but maybe not in a healthy way.
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:35.360]   Maybe it created an unhealthy relationship with politics
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:38.120]   where it's created more partisanship.
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:40.680]   - For me, I don't have a problem with partnership.
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:42.680]   It's what kind of partnership.
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:45.960]   So I think Trump has cultivated a lot of right populists,
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:48.860]   a relationship with his supporters.
[03:08:48.860 --> 03:08:52.020]   It's almost like a leader-follower relationship
[03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:54.340]   in a way that doesn't actually enhance
[03:08:54.340 --> 03:08:56.780]   people's knowledge of politics and the issues,
[03:08:56.780 --> 03:08:59.920]   but actually just leads them to follow the party line.
[03:08:59.920 --> 03:09:03.660]   Ideally, I think socialist politics and politics on the left
[03:09:03.660 --> 03:09:05.180]   should be something different.
[03:09:05.180 --> 03:09:09.060]   Eugene Debs, the great American socialist leader
[03:09:09.060 --> 03:09:11.260]   of the late 19th and early 20th century,
[03:09:11.260 --> 03:09:14.260]   used to say, "I'm not your Moses.
[03:09:14.260 --> 03:09:18.760]   "I can't promise to lead you to the promised land
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:20.080]   "because if I can lead you there
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:21.140]   "and you just follow me there,
[03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:22.840]   "someone's just gonna lead you straight out
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:24.480]   "as soon as I'm gone."
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:26.180]   And I think there's something nice
[03:09:26.180 --> 03:09:31.060]   about that kind of anti-blind following,
[03:09:31.060 --> 03:09:35.120]   leader-follower kind of dynamic on the left at its best.
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:41.060]   - That said, in the way at least the political race
[03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:43.160]   in the United States has turned out,
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:47.280]   it seems like it's turned into a bit of entertainment.
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:51.540]   And there, having personalities and characters
[03:09:51.540 --> 03:09:53.260]   is really important.
[03:09:53.260 --> 03:09:56.380]   So in terms of policy and actual leadership,
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:58.700]   yes, maybe having a leader,
[03:09:58.700 --> 03:10:03.940]   like an authoritarian big leader is not good,
[03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:05.620]   but maybe for the race it is.
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:07.900]   For the drama of it,
[03:10:07.900 --> 03:10:11.620]   you just want to have drama and attention
[03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:13.260]   on people who are actually going to turn out
[03:10:13.260 --> 03:10:14.460]   to be good leaders.
[03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:16.700]   That's a weird balance to strike.
[03:10:16.700 --> 03:10:18.860]   - Earned media is what they always talk about, right?
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:20.060]   In political campaigns,
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:22.460]   like the more you can get on TV,
[03:10:23.300 --> 03:10:24.900]   the better.
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:27.540]   Even like, I really like Federman.
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:29.100]   He just won his campaign.
[03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:31.100]   But a good part of his early campaign,
[03:10:31.100 --> 03:10:33.300]   he had pivoted from talking about issues
[03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:36.060]   to just talking about Dr. Oz living in New Jersey
[03:10:36.060 --> 03:10:38.100]   and kind of having the troll campaign against him,
[03:10:38.100 --> 03:10:39.980]   which I found amusing,
[03:10:39.980 --> 03:10:43.420]   but also it was effective, obviously, he won.
[03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:45.320]   But it's a bit depressing
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:48.180]   'cause I would have rather a whole campaign cycle
[03:10:48.180 --> 03:10:52.600]   about healthcare and jobs and other issues.
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:58.300]   - Yeah, yeah, and the hope is that people just get better
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:11:00.720]   at that kind of social media communication.
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:03.280]   So I do actually think there's something
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:05.720]   about doing political speeches
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:08.240]   that makes you sound less authentic
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:12.040]   because you have to do so many of them.
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:16.140]   It must be exhausting to day after day after day
[03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:17.700]   make the speech.
[03:11:17.700 --> 03:11:21.260]   You're going to start sort of replaying the same stuff
[03:11:21.260 --> 03:11:23.140]   over and over as opposed to actually thinking
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:25.100]   about the words that are coming out of your mouth.
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:26.820]   And then the public will know
[03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:28.980]   that you're not really being that authentic.
[03:11:28.980 --> 03:11:31.920]   Even though you believe those things, it's just tough.
[03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:35.100]   I just wish they didn't have to constantly do speeches.
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:38.980]   - So I think that the fact that Bernie's speeches
[03:11:38.980 --> 03:11:41.800]   very clearly came out of, if not directly his own pen,
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:43.320]   but his own rhetoric over the years,
[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:45.420]   and he kind of wrote it, seemed authentic.
[03:11:45.420 --> 03:11:47.500]   Even if he was repeating it.
[03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:50.140]   And then Trump has just wild improvisation.
[03:11:50.140 --> 03:11:53.860]   I think people found real in a certain way.
[03:11:53.860 --> 03:11:56.180]   And I would love for the left more generally
[03:11:56.180 --> 03:12:00.340]   to tap into some of that anti-establishment sentiment,
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:02.020]   but obviously do it in a way that's productive,
[03:12:02.020 --> 03:12:03.380]   that doesn't blame immigrants
[03:12:03.380 --> 03:12:05.220]   or whatever else for problems,
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:08.500]   but it's kind of built on a different basis.
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:11.100]   But people are fed up for good reason
[03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:12.740]   with a lot of conventional politics,
[03:12:12.740 --> 03:12:15.500]   and we need to speak to that.
[03:12:15.500 --> 03:12:17.400]   Otherwise it'll only be the right
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:21.700]   that is taking advantage of those people's anger.
[03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:24.460]   - Well, I almost forgot to ask you about China.
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:27.480]   So both historically, we talked about the Soviet Union,
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:28.780]   but what lessons do you draw
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:31.680]   from the implementation of socialism and communism
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:35.740]   in Maoist China and modern China?
[03:12:35.740 --> 03:12:37.980]   What's the good and the bad?
[03:12:37.980 --> 03:12:41.500]   - Well, I think it's very similar to the Soviet case,
[03:12:41.500 --> 03:12:44.580]   in that socialism came to China
[03:12:45.580 --> 03:12:49.980]   through not a base of organized workers
[03:12:49.980 --> 03:12:51.900]   and a capitalist country
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:54.100]   to a certain level of development and so on,
[03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:56.460]   but it came through the countryside
[03:12:56.460 --> 03:13:01.460]   and in conditions of civil war, strife,
[03:13:01.460 --> 03:13:03.860]   Japanese invasion and whatever else.
[03:13:03.860 --> 03:13:06.300]   And Mao built his base in the peasantry,
[03:13:06.300 --> 03:13:09.220]   then came down to the city to govern
[03:13:09.220 --> 03:13:13.020]   and try to build a base and rule over workers.
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:14.500]   So it was kind of an inversion
[03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:18.540]   of classic socialist theory.
[03:13:18.540 --> 03:13:21.220]   Now, the same thing that I said before about Stalin
[03:13:21.220 --> 03:13:23.380]   and assessing the Soviet Union has to apply here,
[03:13:23.380 --> 03:13:25.980]   'cause obviously I oppose authoritarianism
[03:13:25.980 --> 03:13:30.260]   and I obviously do all sorts of moral condemnations,
[03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:32.580]   I should do.
[03:13:32.580 --> 03:13:37.140]   But to look at what the Chinese Communist Party
[03:13:37.140 --> 03:13:39.100]   actually accomplished,
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:42.380]   I think we kind of need to take a step backwards
[03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:44.100]   from our moral opposition
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:45.500]   to the means in which they accomplished it
[03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:47.420]   and just look at it developmentally.
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:51.980]   China benefited greatly
[03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:54.860]   from the Communist Party's implementation
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:58.060]   of basic education and healthcare.
[03:13:58.060 --> 03:14:00.380]   So in a lot of China,
[03:14:00.380 --> 03:14:02.300]   you had one of the conditions of women
[03:14:02.300 --> 03:14:03.420]   were absolutely terrible.
[03:14:03.420 --> 03:14:04.580]   There was still foot binding
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:08.140]   and all sorts of like terrible backward practice.
[03:14:08.140 --> 03:14:11.340]   You had a huge vast majority of the population
[03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:14.140]   that was illiterate without any access to basic education
[03:14:14.140 --> 03:14:16.260]   and you had no health access,
[03:14:16.260 --> 03:14:17.860]   especially in the countryside.
[03:14:17.860 --> 03:14:20.420]   So those are the three good things that China did,
[03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:23.540]   improve the status of women,
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:27.740]   get everyone into primary education
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:30.060]   and improve the lot of healthcare.
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:32.060]   Besides for that,
[03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:36.820]   their agricultural campaign was a failure,
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:38.700]   just like Stalin's for many of the same reasons
[03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:39.820]   I mentioned before.
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:42.660]   The great leap forward
[03:14:42.660 --> 03:14:47.660]   and crash industrialization didn't really work either.
[03:14:47.660 --> 03:14:54.300]   In a way, is China better than India or other countries
[03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:59.260]   that didn't have the basic education
[03:14:59.260 --> 03:15:00.580]   and the strong state authority
[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:05.340]   and the health improvements and whatever?
[03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:06.780]   I think maybe,
[03:15:06.780 --> 03:15:09.780]   but I think that's why we need to sometimes go beyond
[03:15:09.780 --> 03:15:13.820]   just economic measures of success.
[03:15:13.820 --> 03:15:15.220]   'Cause if you told me tomorrow,
[03:15:15.220 --> 03:15:20.060]   the US will grow at 3% if we maintain democracy,
[03:15:20.060 --> 03:15:21.980]   but it'll grow at 8, 9%,
[03:15:21.980 --> 03:15:23.060]   everyone will be wealthier
[03:15:23.060 --> 03:15:26.020]   if we move to some sort of authoritarian government.
[03:15:26.020 --> 03:15:28.380]   I think you're asking the wrong question
[03:15:28.380 --> 03:15:30.260]   if you're gonna make your decision based on growth, right?
[03:15:30.260 --> 03:15:33.260]   'Cause it has to be based on some sort of principle.
[03:15:33.260 --> 03:15:35.420]   But the same dynamic of,
[03:15:35.420 --> 03:15:37.540]   from the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party,
[03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:39.020]   ruling over people,
[03:15:39.020 --> 03:15:41.260]   emerging from the outside through armed conflicts
[03:15:41.260 --> 03:15:45.260]   and ruling over ordinary Chinese people have continued.
[03:15:45.260 --> 03:15:47.300]   Since Deng Xiaoping,
[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:49.220]   the policies have been better economically.
[03:15:49.220 --> 03:15:52.060]   And often at times, not always,
[03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:55.660]   the technocratic governance has been quite good.
[03:15:55.660 --> 03:15:58.340]   But that doesn't mean that the party
[03:15:58.340 --> 03:16:00.020]   has a democratic mandate
[03:16:00.020 --> 03:16:05.020]   or should have the right to govern as they see fit.
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:08.460]   'Cause clearly, it doesn't have that mandate
[03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:09.540]   in swaths of the country
[03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:12.540]   or in places like Hong Kong or elsewhere.
[03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:18.940]   But to me, nothing the Chinese Communist Party does
[03:16:18.940 --> 03:16:20.540]   has anything to do with socialism.
[03:16:20.540 --> 03:16:22.500]   I think even by their own definition today,
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:24.100]   it really doesn't.
[03:16:24.100 --> 03:16:29.100]   It's a sort of nationalist authoritarian developmental state
[03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:31.500]   that has done some good things
[03:16:31.500 --> 03:16:34.420]   to improve the living standards of the Chinese people.
[03:16:34.420 --> 03:16:36.580]   Other things that were counterproductive.
[03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:39.820]   And as a democratic socialist,
[03:16:39.820 --> 03:16:43.380]   I certainly don't support that state,
[03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:46.260]   but I also hope that the US and Biden
[03:16:46.260 --> 03:16:51.260]   will find a way to avoid intense rivalry
[03:16:51.260 --> 03:16:52.860]   and competition economically,
[03:16:52.860 --> 03:16:55.660]   spilling over into something worse.
[03:16:55.660 --> 03:16:58.700]   - From a democratic socialist perspective,
[03:16:58.700 --> 03:17:02.540]   what's one policy or one or two ways
[03:17:02.540 --> 03:17:04.540]   you could fix, if you could fix China,
[03:17:04.540 --> 03:17:06.020]   if you took over China,
[03:17:06.020 --> 03:17:07.580]   what would you like to see change?
[03:17:07.580 --> 03:17:10.580]   - Well, the democratic part comes before the socialist part.
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:11.980]   So I would say there needs to be
[03:17:11.980 --> 03:17:14.860]   multi-party elections in China
[03:17:14.860 --> 03:17:19.140]   and state censorship and control over the press,
[03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:22.300]   in other words, needs to be done with.
[03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:26.700]   As far as their immediate economic policy,
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:30.500]   I think the idea of maintaining strong state control
[03:17:30.500 --> 03:17:32.940]   of certain commanding heights of the economy
[03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:35.020]   while liberalizing other spheres
[03:17:35.020 --> 03:17:38.540]   has done quite well in China's case,
[03:17:38.540 --> 03:17:40.060]   lifting people out of poverty.
[03:17:40.060 --> 03:17:45.660]   But again, there's something really lost in society,
[03:17:45.660 --> 03:17:47.580]   even if it's getting wealthier,
[03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:52.180]   if ordinary people don't have the ability
[03:17:52.180 --> 03:17:57.180]   to participate in dissent freely.
[03:17:57.180 --> 03:18:00.140]   And the Chinese authorities have allowed some,
[03:18:00.140 --> 03:18:01.420]   it's not North Korea,
[03:18:01.420 --> 03:18:03.940]   it's not a totally totalitarian state.
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:05.380]   There's been workplace protests,
[03:18:05.380 --> 03:18:09.220]   there've been all sorts of local anti-corruption protests
[03:18:09.220 --> 03:18:10.420]   and things like that,
[03:18:10.420 --> 03:18:12.500]   but the government decides what's permitted
[03:18:12.500 --> 03:18:14.900]   and what's not at what particular moment.
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:19.500]   And I think the long run, even if it can survive,
[03:18:19.500 --> 03:18:23.260]   there's a better way to do things,
[03:18:23.260 --> 03:18:26.020]   which is just quite simply a democracy.
[03:18:26.020 --> 03:18:29.580]   - The thing is though, the lessons of history
[03:18:29.580 --> 03:18:31.540]   that China is looking at,
[03:18:31.540 --> 03:18:33.260]   this is dark aspect.
[03:18:33.260 --> 03:18:35.860]   So building on top of the fact
[03:18:35.860 --> 03:18:39.020]   that it seems like under Stalin and under Mao,
[03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:41.700]   under Stalin, the Soviet Union and under Mao,
[03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:45.100]   China has seen a lot of economic growth.
[03:18:45.100 --> 03:18:48.620]   And then one dark aspect of that,
[03:18:48.620 --> 03:18:50.820]   while under the Great Leap Forward,
[03:18:50.820 --> 03:18:54.740]   you have upwards of 70 million people dead.
[03:18:57.180 --> 03:19:00.020]   Today, I think there's a large number of people
[03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:02.740]   who admire Stalin and admire Mao.
[03:19:02.740 --> 03:19:06.180]   - What they admire is the stability
[03:19:06.180 --> 03:19:07.660]   and the strong leadership.
[03:19:07.660 --> 03:19:10.580]   So there's a lot of people who miss the Soviet Union.
[03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:12.940]   The reason why they miss it
[03:19:12.940 --> 03:19:15.380]   is that it was a system they knew.
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:18.660]   It provided the basics of their livelihood.
[03:19:18.660 --> 03:19:20.540]   Then afterwards, like look at Russia in the '90s,
[03:19:20.540 --> 03:19:21.660]   people were in chaos.
[03:19:21.660 --> 03:19:23.540]   The Communist Party had a huge amount
[03:19:23.540 --> 03:19:25.460]   of support democratically.
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:27.300]   Anti-democratic measures had to be taken,
[03:19:27.300 --> 03:19:29.900]   ironically, against the Communist Party
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:34.580]   to keep it from regaining more of a foothold in Russia.
[03:19:34.580 --> 03:19:38.580]   But we don't need that trade-off.
[03:19:38.580 --> 03:19:41.100]   We could have a form of,
[03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:45.460]   imagine if Russia went to a system
[03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:47.540]   closer to social democracy
[03:19:47.540 --> 03:19:51.500]   that maintained the stability that people wanted,
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:53.860]   the welfare state that people wanted,
[03:19:53.860 --> 03:19:56.540]   but restructured the economy in not a shock way,
[03:19:56.540 --> 03:19:58.980]   but in a way that made sense
[03:19:58.980 --> 03:20:00.820]   and that ordinary people felt ownership of
[03:20:00.820 --> 03:20:01.900]   instead of just oligarchs
[03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:03.820]   who were former Communist Party bureaucracy
[03:20:03.820 --> 03:20:06.020]   just dividing up the country for themselves.
[03:20:06.020 --> 03:20:09.420]   I think the same thing in China.
[03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:12.100]   First of all, certainly from the West,
[03:20:12.100 --> 03:20:16.220]   the US government and people in the US
[03:20:16.220 --> 03:20:19.660]   should have no say over what should happen in China.
[03:20:20.900 --> 03:20:24.420]   The Chinese Communist Party has more authentic authority
[03:20:24.420 --> 03:20:26.860]   than any of us do in the country.
[03:20:26.860 --> 03:20:31.420]   But I think that the fears and stability
[03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:33.180]   that a lot of Chinese people have,
[03:20:33.180 --> 03:20:36.660]   why I would imagine that even in a democratic election,
[03:20:36.660 --> 03:20:41.580]   the Communist Party might have majority support
[03:20:41.580 --> 03:20:44.140]   is because they fear the unknown, they fear collapse.
[03:20:44.140 --> 03:20:48.100]   That was one of the big lessons of the Soviet collapse.
[03:20:48.100 --> 03:20:52.020]   Do you want China divided into five, six states?
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:20:54.700]   Do you want economic turmoil?
[03:20:54.700 --> 03:20:57.380]   Do you want mass immediate privatization?
[03:20:57.380 --> 03:21:00.100]   Do you want whatever welfare state you have
[03:21:00.100 --> 03:21:03.060]   destroyed and so on?
[03:21:03.060 --> 03:21:05.580]   I think people are right to have those fears,
[03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:09.380]   but there's a different route towards democratization
[03:21:09.380 --> 03:21:10.660]   that maintains stability.
[03:21:10.660 --> 03:21:15.660]   There's different routes that you could have democracy.
[03:21:16.140 --> 03:21:19.700]   Not every country had to go down the route of Yugoslavia
[03:21:19.700 --> 03:21:21.940]   and the USSR and so on.
[03:21:21.940 --> 03:21:28.540]   - You are the founder of the magazine Jacobin,
[03:21:28.540 --> 03:21:31.060]   of which I am a subscriber.
[03:21:31.060 --> 03:21:32.660]   I recommend everybody subscribe,
[03:21:32.660 --> 03:21:35.340]   whether you're on the left or the right.
[03:21:35.340 --> 03:21:38.860]   The magazine does tend to lean left.
[03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:40.940]   Does it officially say it's socialist?
[03:21:40.940 --> 03:21:42.340]   - We're a socialist publication.
[03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:43.420]   We try to be interesting.
[03:21:43.420 --> 03:21:47.180]   So we try to have articles that have debates
[03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:48.660]   and contestation and whatever else,
[03:21:48.660 --> 03:21:50.940]   but we're definitely, we're all socialists.
[03:21:50.940 --> 03:21:54.500]   - Well, it's a lot of really interesting articles.
[03:21:54.500 --> 03:21:57.460]   So I definitely recommend that people subscribe, support.
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:03.580]   The product of the 21st century,
[03:22:03.580 --> 03:22:05.620]   only subscribe to the digital version,
[03:22:05.620 --> 03:22:07.220]   but I guess there's also paper version.
[03:22:07.220 --> 03:22:10.460]   - Yeah, there's like 70,000 subscribers in print.
[03:22:10.460 --> 03:22:11.660]   - In print? - Yeah.
[03:22:11.660 --> 03:22:12.940]   - Does it come on a scroll?
[03:22:12.940 --> 03:22:13.980]   I don't even know, it's a paper.
[03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:15.900]   Do they even publish paper magazines anymore?
[03:22:15.900 --> 03:22:17.780]   - I'm gonna mail you a bunch of copies.
[03:22:17.780 --> 03:22:20.260]   No, it's perfect bound, it's long issues.
[03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:23.500]   Our Jacobin's publisher, Remy K4,
[03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:26.940]   just recently did a redesign of the publication.
[03:22:26.940 --> 03:22:28.020]   So it looks really good.
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:32.460]   It's up there in the design award competition range.
[03:22:32.460 --> 03:22:34.460]   - Nice, it's sexy.
[03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:37.180]   I can show it off to all my friends, look.
[03:22:37.180 --> 03:22:38.140]   - Put it in your coffee table.
[03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:39.140]   You don't even have to read it.
[03:22:39.140 --> 03:22:41.900]   - First I need to get a coffee table, but yes, I'll get both.
[03:22:41.900 --> 03:22:43.660]   That's what a respectable adult, listen,
[03:22:43.660 --> 03:22:45.900]   I've upgraded my life.
[03:22:45.900 --> 03:22:48.300]   I haven't had a couch, I don't think ever.
[03:22:48.300 --> 03:22:50.380]   So I got a couch recently 'cause somebody told me
[03:22:50.380 --> 03:22:52.420]   that serious adults have a couch.
[03:22:52.420 --> 03:22:55.140]   And I also got a TV because serious adults
[03:22:55.140 --> 03:22:56.260]   have a couch and a TV.
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:22:58.540]   And as you can see, it's been here for many months
[03:22:58.540 --> 03:23:00.060]   and I still haven't like unboxed it.
[03:23:00.060 --> 03:23:04.020]   So I'm trying to learn how to be an adult,
[03:23:04.020 --> 03:23:06.860]   looking up on YouTube how to be an adult
[03:23:06.860 --> 03:23:08.500]   and learning slowly.
[03:23:08.500 --> 03:23:10.980]   After that, I'll look into this whole leisure thing.
[03:23:10.980 --> 03:23:13.020]   - Anyway, what's the origin of Jackman?
[03:23:13.020 --> 03:23:14.220]   What was the idea?
[03:23:14.220 --> 03:23:16.180]   What was the mission and what's the origin story?
[03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:20.100]   - So I started Jackman when I was between my sophomore
[03:23:20.100 --> 03:23:21.660]   and junior year of college.
[03:23:21.660 --> 03:23:23.580]   Basically, I was already a socialist.
[03:23:23.580 --> 03:23:25.700]   I was involved in the Democratic Socialist of America.
[03:23:25.700 --> 03:23:28.340]   I was in the youth section,
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:30.180]   the young Democratic Socialist.
[03:23:30.180 --> 03:23:33.460]   I was editing their kind of youth online magazine
[03:23:33.460 --> 03:23:35.980]   called The Activist back then.
[03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:39.500]   And to be honest, I had my ideology, I had my views.
[03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:41.180]   I had a group of people around me
[03:23:41.180 --> 03:23:44.300]   that we would debate together and occasionally write
[03:23:44.300 --> 03:23:47.580]   for this other publication, The Activist and so on.
[03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:51.060]   And yeah, just a product of creative ignorance
[03:23:51.060 --> 03:23:53.740]   in the sense that I knew I had the capacity
[03:23:53.740 --> 03:23:55.180]   to maybe pull off an issue or two.
[03:23:55.180 --> 03:23:58.260]   I just had no idea how long I would keep doing it.
[03:23:58.260 --> 03:24:01.620]   And it just eventually consumed my life slowly but surely.
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.620]   Like I had different plans for my future,
[03:24:04.620 --> 03:24:09.380]   I kind of, but I ended up just being a magazine publisher.
[03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:12.100]   I literally didn't know what a magazine publisher was,
[03:24:12.100 --> 03:24:13.540]   but it just kind of happened.
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:16.100]   - What's the hardest part about running a magazine?
[03:24:16.100 --> 03:24:19.060]   - Well, the hardest part is obviously the things,
[03:24:19.060 --> 03:24:21.460]   just like any enterprise, right?
[03:24:21.460 --> 03:24:22.620]   The things beyond your control.
[03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:24.540]   Like you could put out something
[03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:27.500]   that you think is great or interesting,
[03:24:27.500 --> 03:24:29.180]   but then you need the feedback
[03:24:29.180 --> 03:24:32.300]   of people actually subscribing to it.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:34.180]   And you occasionally encounter periods
[03:24:34.180 --> 03:24:35.740]   where you feel like you're doing your best work,
[03:24:35.740 --> 03:24:39.020]   but you're not getting the audience response.
[03:24:39.020 --> 03:24:41.020]   And I think you just need the kind of,
[03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:45.900]   the self-confidence to just keep doing it.
[03:24:45.900 --> 03:24:49.860]   And obviously, if you're totally obscure and crazy
[03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:50.700]   and way off the mark,
[03:24:50.700 --> 03:24:53.460]   you're never gonna build that audience.
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:56.580]   But I think a lot of publications have tried to,
[03:24:56.580 --> 03:24:58.300]   same thing, I guess, goes with YouTube shows,
[03:24:58.300 --> 03:24:59.620]   whatever else, they try to adapt
[03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:01.380]   to what everyone else is doing right away
[03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:03.780]   when they don't achieve success.
[03:25:03.780 --> 03:25:05.620]   Whereas for me, the early issues of "Jackman"
[03:25:05.620 --> 03:25:07.420]   got very little resonance and took a while
[03:25:07.420 --> 03:25:09.780]   for it to build into something.
[03:25:09.780 --> 03:25:11.740]   But a lot of it was just the confidence
[03:25:11.740 --> 03:25:13.820]   to just keep going and keep publishing
[03:25:13.820 --> 03:25:14.940]   what I would wanna read
[03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:17.060]   and just hope that I'm not so much of a weirdo,
[03:25:17.060 --> 03:25:18.220]   that I'm the only one.
[03:25:18.220 --> 03:25:22.900]   - Is there some pressure that you could speak to
[03:25:22.900 --> 03:25:24.820]   of audience capture?
[03:25:24.820 --> 03:25:27.660]   Because it is a socialist publication,
[03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:31.540]   you have a fan base, a readership base.
[03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:33.420]   Is there times you feel pressured
[03:25:33.420 --> 03:25:36.260]   not to say a certain thing, not to call out bullshit?
[03:25:37.260 --> 03:25:40.700]   Not to criticize certain candidates,
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:42.460]   all that kind of stuff?
[03:25:42.460 --> 03:25:43.980]   - Yes, definitely, of course.
[03:25:43.980 --> 03:25:49.260]   I myself am looser on the self-censorship than other people.
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:53.060]   That's only because I've gotten this far
[03:25:53.060 --> 03:25:56.340]   just shooting from the hip or whatever.
[03:25:56.340 --> 03:25:59.700]   And occasionally, you'll come to a rash judgment.
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:02.780]   You'll speak too soon or complain about something too soon
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:05.860]   and you'll have to either apologize
[03:26:05.860 --> 03:26:08.140]   or reconsider or whatever else.
[03:26:08.140 --> 03:26:09.580]   But on a host of issues,
[03:26:09.580 --> 03:26:13.700]   I have views that maybe not all of the left has,
[03:26:13.700 --> 03:26:15.940]   but I know that the core of my politics
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:19.860]   is a politics against oppression, against exploitation,
[03:26:19.860 --> 03:26:22.180]   against all the things that we talked about.
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:24.380]   And if you know that's at the core of your politics,
[03:26:24.380 --> 03:26:26.260]   then you could maybe say,
[03:26:26.260 --> 03:26:28.380]   you know what, I don't think the left
[03:26:28.380 --> 03:26:32.020]   should respond to the real racist
[03:26:32.020 --> 03:26:33.060]   and the still right in the world
[03:26:33.060 --> 03:26:35.740]   by adopting an excessively racialized rhetoric.
[03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:36.900]   If that makes sense.
[03:26:36.900 --> 03:26:39.900]   Like I fundamentally just am a universalist
[03:26:39.900 --> 03:26:42.140]   and I believe that people,
[03:26:42.140 --> 03:26:44.940]   no matter where their backgrounds are and so on,
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:46.980]   kind of want the same things for themselves
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:49.380]   and for their families.
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:54.380]   And I feel like a lot of the left or some of the left,
[03:26:54.380 --> 03:26:57.060]   not even the far left, more like the center left,
[03:26:57.060 --> 03:27:00.180]   has adopted kind of a stance saying,
[03:27:00.180 --> 03:27:01.940]   oh, we need to talk about white privilege
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:06.220]   or white Karen's or white guys
[03:27:06.220 --> 03:27:08.420]   or old white guys doing this or whatever else.
[03:27:08.420 --> 03:27:11.540]   And to me, it's not only wrong in a moral sense,
[03:27:11.540 --> 03:27:12.940]   but it's counterproductive.
[03:27:12.940 --> 03:27:17.260]   'Cause the last thing I want is a young white teenager
[03:27:17.260 --> 03:27:21.780]   who feels unrepresented politically
[03:27:21.780 --> 03:27:24.500]   and wants to be a part of maybe even the left
[03:27:24.500 --> 03:27:29.180]   to feel like, oh, I should think more about my identity.
[03:27:29.180 --> 03:27:31.140]   No, the whole point of anti-racist politics
[03:27:31.140 --> 03:27:33.140]   is that we want to live in a world where,
[03:27:33.140 --> 03:27:37.860]   me and you can go around the corner and get a beer
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:41.580]   and we're not people of two different races getting a beer,
[03:27:41.580 --> 03:27:44.700]   we're just two guys in America getting a beer.
[03:27:44.700 --> 03:27:47.900]   We're trying to have the type of society
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:50.860]   in which there's less of that sort of communal
[03:27:50.860 --> 03:27:52.980]   or racialized identity.
[03:27:52.980 --> 03:27:54.820]   And that was a whole point of a whole generation
[03:27:54.820 --> 03:27:56.420]   of anti-racist struggle.
[03:27:56.460 --> 03:28:01.460]   But now we seem to be kind of reifying it in the media
[03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:04.100]   and in culture and in politics.
[03:28:04.100 --> 03:28:06.140]   And that's one issue where I've been kind of
[03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:08.540]   banging the drum on this to the point that it's annoying
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:09.620]   in certain parts of the left.
[03:28:09.620 --> 03:28:13.380]   I don't think there's maybe extreme opposition
[03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:15.340]   among socialists, but it's more like,
[03:28:15.340 --> 03:28:17.420]   why do you keep focusing on this?
[03:28:17.420 --> 03:28:19.460]   Let's focus on our real enemy, the right,
[03:28:19.460 --> 03:28:22.180]   instead of criticizing this part of-
[03:28:22.180 --> 03:28:25.300]   - No, I think it's really, I'm really glad you exist.
[03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:27.140]   I'm really glad you're beating that drum
[03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:32.140]   because I think that's one of the reasons
[03:28:32.140 --> 03:28:35.500]   that the left has not had a broader impact
[03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:39.780]   or is not heard by more people that could hear its message
[03:28:39.780 --> 03:28:43.460]   is because the othering, the othering of,
[03:28:43.460 --> 03:28:48.460]   like as if there's two teams, as if it's black and white,
[03:28:48.460 --> 03:28:50.780]   as opposed to having, there's a common humanity
[03:28:50.780 --> 03:28:53.500]   and a common struggle amongst all of us.
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:57.860]   You also wrote the book that we mentioned a few times,
[03:28:57.860 --> 03:28:59.940]   "The Socialist Manifesto,"
[03:28:59.940 --> 03:29:01.780]   the case for radical politics
[03:29:01.780 --> 03:29:03.620]   in an era of extreme inequality.
[03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:04.460]   What's the framework?
[03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:06.300]   What are the key ideas of the book?
[03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:09.820]   - So a lot of it's a look at socialism's past,
[03:29:09.820 --> 03:29:12.140]   present and future, basically.
[03:29:12.140 --> 03:29:14.420]   So a lot of it is historical.
[03:29:14.420 --> 03:29:19.300]   The opening chapter uses a pasta sauce factory
[03:29:19.300 --> 03:29:21.600]   as a way to explain certain Marxist concepts,
[03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:22.900]   but also a theory of change,
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:27.260]   like how we get from, let's say, pure capitalism
[03:29:27.260 --> 03:29:32.100]   to more regulated, unionized and social democratic systems,
[03:29:32.100 --> 03:29:33.860]   and then beyond social democracy
[03:29:33.860 --> 03:29:35.980]   into my vision of socialism.
[03:29:35.980 --> 03:29:37.300]   That's kind of the first little bit.
[03:29:37.300 --> 03:29:39.380]   It's like a visionary kind of like look
[03:29:39.380 --> 03:29:42.540]   at the future of socialism.
[03:29:42.540 --> 03:29:43.780]   But then I try to explain
[03:29:43.780 --> 03:29:46.740]   why some of the past socialist movements have gone wrong.
[03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:48.580]   'Cause I think we can't take for granted,
[03:29:48.580 --> 03:29:50.300]   I think a lot of people want to live
[03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:52.340]   in a different or better society,
[03:29:52.340 --> 03:29:54.620]   but they look at past examples and they're skeptical.
[03:29:54.620 --> 03:29:57.140]   And I think there's good reason for skepticism.
[03:29:57.140 --> 03:30:02.140]   So I try to explain both the successes of certain systems,
[03:30:02.140 --> 03:30:04.880]   like social democracy, but also what happened in Russia,
[03:30:04.880 --> 03:30:09.660]   China, and kind of more of a historical overview.
[03:30:09.660 --> 03:30:13.100]   Then the book kind of ends in the present.
[03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:15.460]   It ends with looking at the Bernie Sanders campaign,
[03:30:15.460 --> 03:30:17.820]   why it resonated, looking at some of the problems
[03:30:17.820 --> 03:30:22.820]   facing the US, the UK, other advanced economies,
[03:30:22.820 --> 03:30:27.820]   and why I think the socialist message is still relevant.
[03:30:27.820 --> 03:30:30.620]   'Cause for the longest time, I'm 33,
[03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:33.500]   I became a socialist as a teenager.
[03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:35.860]   And for the longest time, it seemed like I was just a member
[03:30:35.860 --> 03:30:38.700]   of a historical society, keeping alive an idea
[03:30:38.700 --> 03:30:40.860]   that nobody was interested in anymore.
[03:30:40.860 --> 03:30:44.060]   And now it's heartening to see more young people
[03:30:44.060 --> 03:30:47.620]   interested in the idea, but we actually need to,
[03:30:47.620 --> 03:30:51.860]   I think, have a clearer sense of what we stand for
[03:30:51.860 --> 03:30:54.500]   and how we make our movement, like it used to be,
[03:30:54.500 --> 03:30:56.180]   more rooted in the working class.
[03:30:56.180 --> 03:30:58.980]   So if anyone rewinds the tape,
[03:30:58.980 --> 03:31:00.540]   they go to when we first started talking
[03:31:00.540 --> 03:31:03.900]   about early socialism, when I was talking about
[03:31:03.900 --> 03:31:06.620]   the German social democratic workers movement
[03:31:06.620 --> 03:31:10.340]   or all these different early parties.
[03:31:10.340 --> 03:31:13.700]   I think at various points, I use the word worker
[03:31:13.700 --> 03:31:16.740]   and socialist movement interchangeably,
[03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:19.900]   because in fact, at the time, it was pretty interchangeable.
[03:31:19.900 --> 03:31:24.340]   Socialism was the ideology that had the appeal
[03:31:24.340 --> 03:31:25.860]   of the working class movement.
[03:31:25.860 --> 03:31:29.860]   You couldn't really separate between the two.
[03:31:29.860 --> 03:31:33.700]   Now, obviously, socialism is like a fringe ideological
[03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:36.100]   concurrent among a very small minority
[03:31:36.100 --> 03:31:38.460]   of the working class, which is fine,
[03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:41.220]   but we need to get to the point, I think, ideally,
[03:31:41.220 --> 03:31:44.260]   where when people talk about unions and people protesting
[03:31:44.260 --> 03:31:46.100]   and social movements and socialism,
[03:31:46.100 --> 03:31:48.660]   they all kind of are one in the same
[03:31:48.660 --> 03:31:51.060]   as part of the same broad movement.
[03:31:51.060 --> 03:31:52.820]   - How did you become a socialist?
[03:31:52.820 --> 03:31:54.900]   What was the personal story
[03:31:54.900 --> 03:31:56.980]   or the idea that took hold in your mind?
[03:31:56.980 --> 03:31:58.300]   - So I'm the youngest of five.
[03:31:58.300 --> 03:32:02.140]   I was the only one in my family born in the United States.
[03:32:02.140 --> 03:32:05.460]   So it was very obvious to me that my life outcomes
[03:32:05.460 --> 03:32:08.220]   were very different than the life outcomes of my siblings.
[03:32:08.220 --> 03:32:11.980]   So my three oldest siblings didn't go to college
[03:32:11.980 --> 03:32:13.580]   after high school.
[03:32:13.580 --> 03:32:17.620]   Some of them got their degrees much later on as adults,
[03:32:17.620 --> 03:32:21.900]   but I was from a pretty young age,
[03:32:21.900 --> 03:32:23.860]   had access to a great public school district
[03:32:23.860 --> 03:32:28.860]   and was put on the track that you're gonna go to college.
[03:32:28.860 --> 03:32:31.060]   This is kind of the outcome.
[03:32:31.060 --> 03:32:34.020]   And like I said, even my grandmother was illiterate.
[03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:38.660]   My mom didn't have a lot of educational opportunities early
[03:32:38.660 --> 03:32:41.700]   in her life.
[03:32:41.700 --> 03:32:43.560]   She actually graduated from college the same year
[03:32:43.560 --> 03:32:44.400]   I did.
[03:32:44.400 --> 03:32:48.260]   So she later got her kind of degrees and whatever else.
[03:32:48.260 --> 03:32:53.580]   But to me, it was obvious that so much of my life outcomes
[03:32:53.580 --> 03:32:57.020]   weren't just a product of hard work or my family sacrifices.
[03:32:57.020 --> 03:33:02.020]   'Cause of course I had the same family as my siblings,
[03:33:02.020 --> 03:33:05.460]   but the product of state institutions helping out,
[03:33:05.460 --> 03:33:09.700]   evening things out, public school district, public library,
[03:33:09.700 --> 03:33:11.580]   like all sorts of afterschool programs,
[03:33:11.580 --> 03:33:14.520]   all that was the domain of the state
[03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:16.120]   and I really benefited from it.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:20.800]   So in essence, my core was a social democratic belief.
[03:33:20.800 --> 03:33:23.460]   The state should redistribute a bit,
[03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:26.220]   build public institutions, be an equalizer.
[03:33:26.220 --> 03:33:28.480]   Now, how I became a Marxist and a socialist
[03:33:28.480 --> 03:33:29.320]   was much more random.
[03:33:29.320 --> 03:33:31.580]   I was just intellectually interested in it.
[03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:34.120]   And eventually I kind of merged the two together
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:37.840]   where I merged together my more pragmatic
[03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:41.040]   and practical interest in day-to-day concerns
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:42.760]   and reforms and so on,
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:45.720]   with my loftier intellectual interests in Marxism
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:47.320]   into the politics I have today,
[03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:50.520]   which I try to kind of balance and do both.
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:53.560]   And I think a lot of socialists in the organization
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:54.740]   that I joined as a teenager,
[03:33:54.740 --> 03:33:58.200]   the Democratic Socialists of America and elsewhere,
[03:33:58.200 --> 03:33:59.240]   try to do the two,
[03:33:59.240 --> 03:34:02.040]   try to maintain some sort of balance between here
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:04.800]   and our vision of the future.
[03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:06.080]   - What do you think Marx would say
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:08.440]   if he were to read your book,
[03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:10.680]   "Socialist Manifest" and do a review?
[03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:14.000]   - So I think Marx would say that
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:18.200]   my vision of a socialism after capitalism
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:22.340]   maintains key elements of what he would,
[03:34:22.340 --> 03:34:25.760]   the commodity form.
[03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:28.000]   So a lot of what Marx was concerned about was
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:33.520]   what markets do to human relationships
[03:34:33.520 --> 03:34:34.360]   in a negative sense.
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:36.320]   His early writings especially focus a lot
[03:34:36.320 --> 03:34:38.400]   on the alienation of labor.
[03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:43.200]   My vision of socialism, at least in the near term,
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:46.280]   a lot of that is about de-commodifying certain sectors,
[03:34:46.280 --> 03:34:48.440]   so reducing the market in certain sectors
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:52.000]   and reducing alienation, but not eliminating it.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:55.300]   It is about eliminating exploitation and oppression.
[03:34:55.300 --> 03:34:59.360]   So knowing Marx and knowing how critical he was
[03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:02.160]   of certain other socialist strands and tendencies,
[03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:04.000]   and he would often write very snarky notes
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:06.280]   and letters to people like Engels being like,
[03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:09.600]   this guy, LaSalle, he's a total asshole.
[03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:11.920]   Then he would send a separate note to LaSalle saying,
[03:35:11.920 --> 03:35:13.680]   hey, can I borrow five grand?
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:14.720]   This is actually true.
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:19.400]   He did the both, I think the same month.
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:21.600]   - So he would be really good at Twitter is what you say.
[03:35:21.600 --> 03:35:23.120]   - Oh, he would be the best at Twitter.
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:25.720]   And also he used to be, he was a journalist before
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:28.340]   with his work for the New York Tribune.
[03:35:28.340 --> 03:35:30.560]   He was very clever, very snarky.
[03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:32.560]   He would be awesome at Twitter.
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:35.240]   I think him and Elon would have good back and forths,
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:37.080]   but I think it would be critical in some parts,
[03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:41.000]   but I think the strangest part for him
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:42.800]   would be reading the historical sections
[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:45.740]   and seeing the way in which his ideas,
[03:35:45.740 --> 03:35:48.480]   which was fundamentally ideas about human emancipation
[03:35:48.480 --> 03:35:53.720]   were used for evil, for hardship,
[03:35:53.720 --> 03:35:56.580]   in ways that did the opposite of emancipated,
[03:35:56.580 --> 03:35:58.680]   but in some cases, enslaved people.
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:00.680]   And I think he would have definitely
[03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:02.800]   not want to be associated with them.
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:05.480]   He probably would rather be associated with me than them,
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:08.240]   but even then only begrudgingly.
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:12.280]   (Lex laughing)
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:15.080]   - What advice would you give to young folks
[03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:19.480]   in high school, in college,
[03:36:19.480 --> 03:36:21.800]   how to have a career they can be proud of
[03:36:21.800 --> 03:36:23.760]   or how to change the world?
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:25.740]   - I think be intellectually curious,
[03:36:25.740 --> 03:36:29.680]   read outside your current beliefs
[03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:33.640]   and understand or read authors on their own terms.
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:36.000]   So the worst thing in the world to do is to read anything,
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:37.940]   especially work of fiction, but anything,
[03:36:37.940 --> 03:36:42.200]   and try to deduce the author's backgrounds
[03:36:42.200 --> 03:36:43.400]   or politics or whatever else.
[03:36:43.400 --> 03:36:45.640]   Read it on its own terms first,
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:46.760]   then you could reread it
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:50.000]   and kind of do other examinations or whatever else.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:51.360]   And also read a lot of history.
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:55.560]   So I started off reading books like Eric Hoppesbaum's
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:01.960]   four books on history going from the 1700s
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:03.800]   all the way to 1994.
[03:37:03.800 --> 03:37:06.000]   The last book is "The Age of Extremes."
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.200]   But I think understanding history
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:10.480]   gives you a bird's eye view of everything,
[03:37:10.480 --> 03:37:14.440]   sociology, economics, everything.
[03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:16.800]   So these big sweeping historical books
[03:37:16.800 --> 03:37:18.760]   are really useful to know.
[03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:21.000]   Like everybody should know basically
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:24.400]   what year or at least like what decade,
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:26.440]   serfdom was abolished, what decade,
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:30.480]   slavery was abolished, what century Magna Carta was,
[03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:32.000]   when the Roman Empire fell,
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:33.360]   even though that's kind of debated
[03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:34.960]   when the Roman Empire fell.
[03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:37.280]   All these, I think like being a person
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:40.160]   with a general knowledge and general sense of history
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:41.960]   and whatever else just makes you more eclectic
[03:37:41.960 --> 03:37:42.800]   and interesting.
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:44.520]   And it's way better than just,
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:46.680]   like especially a lot of my Indian friends,
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:50.160]   the, not just Indians, but the hyper-focus on like,
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:53.760]   you got to specialize and you got to like focus on math
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:55.400]   or engineering, whatever you want to do.
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:37:57.440]   You just know your field really well, but nothing else.
[03:37:57.440 --> 03:38:00.200]   Like, I think there's something really too,
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:01.160]   whether you're getting in school
[03:38:01.160 --> 03:38:02.320]   or you're just going to do it by yourself,
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:05.960]   giving yourself kind of a liberal arts education.
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:07.760]   - I think there's a lot of power to sort of
[03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:09.880]   having the facts of history in terms of in time,
[03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:12.480]   when stuff happened, but also really powerful
[03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:15.680]   is knowing spatially, like the geography,
[03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:18.000]   that we're a point on a map
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:19.800]   and there's interesting dynamics
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:21.280]   that happened throughout history
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:22.920]   of all the different nations in Europe,
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:24.680]   of all the different military conflicts
[03:38:24.680 --> 03:38:29.680]   and the expansions and the wars and the empires
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:30.840]   and all that kind of stuff.
[03:38:30.840 --> 03:38:34.920]   It really puts into context how human history
[03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:36.640]   has led to the place we are today.
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:39.000]   'Cause all the different geopolitical conflicts
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000]   we have today, even the politics of the day
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:42.680]   is grounded in history.
[03:38:42.680 --> 03:38:44.440]   Maybe less so for the United States,
[03:38:44.440 --> 03:38:46.640]   'cause it has a very young history,
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:48.280]   but that history, even for the United States,
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:49.400]   is still there, right?
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:53.040]   From the civil war and understanding that
[03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:55.920]   gives you context to when you tweet random stuff
[03:38:55.920 --> 03:39:00.920]   about this or that person or politician and so on.
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:03.480]   Yeah, very true.
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:05.280]   Very true.
[03:39:05.280 --> 03:39:07.040]   One of the regrets I have currently is
[03:39:07.040 --> 03:39:10.880]   I have perhaps been too focused on the 20th century
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:14.720]   in terms of history, the present and the 20th century.
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:17.720]   A lot of people write to me that
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:19.360]   there's a lot of lessons to be learned
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:21.280]   in ancient history as well.
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:22.880]   So not just even American history,
[03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:25.600]   but just looking farther and farther and farther back.
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:30.640]   Yeah, that feels like it's another time,
[03:39:30.640 --> 03:39:33.080]   it's another place, it totally has no lessons.
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:34.680]   But then you remind yourself that
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:36.720]   it's the same human beings, right?
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:38.360]   Yeah, and also we're no smarter than them.
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:41.200]   We just have more crude knowledge in part 'cause of them.
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:44.240]   But they were just as clever as us.
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:48.320]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole experiment
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:50.440]   we have going on on Earth?
[03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:52.080]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:55.800]   Well, I think there's no broad meaning of life.
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:39:57.600]   There's, you know, it was an accident,
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:00.360]   but we ourselves need to make our own meaning.
[03:40:00.360 --> 03:40:05.240]   And for me, a lot of it is about posterity,
[03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:08.760]   trying to do something worthwhile while on Earth,
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:10.800]   but also leaving something behind.
[03:40:10.800 --> 03:40:14.320]   It could just be relationships with friends or family.
[03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:15.880]   In the future, maybe having a family
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:19.960]   and kind of like leaving behind that sort of legacy,
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:22.960]   like little bits of yourself, but also, you know,
[03:40:22.960 --> 03:40:24.920]   like them being able to learn the same way
[03:40:24.920 --> 03:40:26.560]   I have little bits of my parents
[03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:29.320]   and my grandparents in me.
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:32.040]   And then also, I think in a social sense,
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:34.840]   zooming out from just the individual and the family,
[03:40:34.840 --> 03:40:39.840]   leaving the world behind a little better.
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:43.760]   You know, I would love to be a part of a movement
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:46.200]   that created a world with a little bit less suffering,
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:49.120]   a little bit less oppression or exploitation
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:51.440]   or whatever else.
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:53.520]   That's really why I'm a socialist.
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:56.360]   You know, it's not about snapping your fingers
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:40:59.640]   and curing the world of everything in one go,
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:02.840]   but it is about, I think, putting our lives,
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:04.880]   giving our lives some sort of meaning and purpose.
[03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:06.760]   And you don't have to be a socialist to do that.
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:08.800]   You could just do it at the, you know,
[03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:13.000]   at the micro level in your own day-to-day interactions.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.960]   But I just feel like life has no good meaning
[03:41:15.960 --> 03:41:20.560]   without thinking of posterity in the future.
[03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:24.080]   - And I have to say, thank you for doing so.
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:26.000]   Thank you for caring about the struggle
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:30.280]   of the people in the world through ideas that are bold
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:32.960]   and I think challenging for a lot of people.
[03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:36.200]   In a time when socialism is something
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:37.960]   that can be attacked aggressively
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:39.480]   by large numbers of people,
[03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:42.720]   still persevering and still exploring those ideas
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:45.240]   and seeing what of those ideas can make
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:47.520]   for a better world, that's beautiful to see.
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:49.040]   Bhaskar, thank you so much for talking today.
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:50.280]   Thank you for all the work you do.
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:52.400]   I can't wait to see what you do next.
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:53.240]   - I appreciate it.
[03:41:53.240 --> 03:41:55.160]   And yeah, thanks for keeping an open mind
[03:41:55.160 --> 03:41:57.440]   with these conversations and to your audience too.
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:00.720]   You know, it's nice to have a space where, you know,
[03:42:00.720 --> 03:42:02.960]   people can debate and think at length
[03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:05.280]   and don't have to worry about soundbite culture.

[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:21.400]   Democracy is the road to socialism.
