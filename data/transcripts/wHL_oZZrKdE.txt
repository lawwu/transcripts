[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found in Paul's first epistle to Timothy,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   in the first chapter, and I shall read from verse 12 to verse 16.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   The first epistle to Timothy, the first chapter beginning at verse 12 and reading to verse 16.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   But I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now I want this evening to deal particularly with verse 13 and indeed even with the second half of verse 13.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We are considering these Sunday evenings the great and remarkable and astounding case of the conversion of this man the apostle Paul.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   We are considering together how Saul of Tarsus ever became the apostle Paul.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And we have said that we are doing so for a large number of reasons which we needn't trouble to repeat tonight.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It is one of those great outstanding events in history which because of that and in and of itself deserves our study and our most careful attention.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   This is one of the most remarkable men that have ever lived.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And no man has left a deeper mark and impress upon the course of human history than this selfsame apostle.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So as we are interested in great men and as we feel that we can always learn lessons by reading and studying the lives of great men,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   it behoves us to consider the life of these men.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But as I have said we are not animated merely by some historical or biographical motive or interest,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   but we are turning to this case for the very reason that he himself gives us in the words that I have just read to you.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   He says, "Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   In other words we are not preaching the apostle Paul.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Great men though he was and I claim that I am second to none in my admiration for him.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But even I do not preach the apostle Paul.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We are looking at his story and at his case because in it and through it, as he tells us,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   if we take the trouble to do so, we shall find ourselves discovering the very principles
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   that control this great and mighty change that takes place in a soul when it becomes Christian.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We are concerned about what is called conversion.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   This tremendous thing that happens to men and women and takes hold of them
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and moves them from one position into another and gives them an entirely new life,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   even as it did to the apostle Paul himself.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now I say that that is the thing that interests us, not a mere bit of hero worship,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   not a mere human carnal interest in greatness.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But this man and his story and what happened to him is a great object lesson
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   which brings us face to face with the very truth that we all need to know for ourselves
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   if we ever are to live the kind of life that he came to live as a Christian
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and if we are to enjoy the benefits of this wonderful salvation.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Now the first time we considered it, we looked at it as he puts it in writing, you remember, to the Galatians.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   He says in writing to the Galatians in the first chapter that the churches of Judea had never seen him,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   they didn't know him, they'd never seen his face.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   He says all they knew about him was this, that he which prosecuted us in times past
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   That is the contrast from that to this.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And again we saw it last Sunday night as he puts it in the third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   where he goes into the matter a little bit more thoroughly
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and gives us a kind of analysis of the things that had held him back.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now here he is stating it again in yet a different way and as I believe,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   taking us a step further forward in an understanding of this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   He says it with shame but he has to admit it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He says that he was a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   That is what he had once been.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But he's no longer that.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Now doesn't it seem almost incredible to us,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   familiar as we are with the life and the writings of the great apostle Paul,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   doesn't it seem almost incredible to us that this man could once be a blasphemer,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   a persecutor, and an injurious kind of person?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I say it is almost incredible but it is a simple fact.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There was a time when this man, who is perhaps the greatest Christian that the church has ever known,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   certainly the greatest preacher, certainly the greatest evangelist that the church has ever known.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It is the simple fact I say to say that at one time this man hated Christ,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   hated the person, hated his teaching, hated all that belonged to him,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   hated the Christian church, and really believed, quite honestly and sincerely,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   that he was doing God's will by persecuting the church, demolishing it,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   trying to wipe its people, its followers, off the very face of the earth.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That I say was once the fact.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That was his exact position as he here reminds us.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Now the question to which we must address ourselves is this.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Why was he once like that?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   This man, I say, who afterwards became the most notable apostle, the most outstanding preacher,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   the man who knows what it is perhaps above everybody else who has ever lived,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   what it is to be thrilled by this gospel, this news.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   What was it that ever held him back from it?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And not only held him back from it, but made him a violent, blasphemous persecutor of it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That's the question.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Well now, last Sunday night we saw a part of the answer to that question.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   He tells us himself very frankly.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Let me just remind you of the headings.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   He was held back partly by his pride in his nationality.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The fact that he was a Jew became a stumbling block to him.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Great thing though it was, because of his wrong and carnal pride in it,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   he was blinded to the gospel.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   That was one thing.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But then you remember he tells us also that his very ability did it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   His outstanding brain, his mental capacity, that proved a hindrance,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   as it has proved a hindrance to many others.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Indeed, the apostle seems to me to make out a case in the first chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   to this effect, that the last sin of men is intellectual pride.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And therefore men who are gifted by God with unusual intellects have to be exceptionally careful.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That very gift of God they may use in the wrong way to such an extent that it becomes an obstacle
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to their full salvation and knowledge of God.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And then we went on to consider his sincerity, his unusual sincerity.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   He's always lived in all good conscience, he says, and he's speaking the truth.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But sincerity wasn't enough.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Zeal likewise he had, and above all the fact that he was so religious.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   He was an exceptionally religious man.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And we saw as we closed last Sunday night that the fact that a man is religious
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   may be the one thing that prevents his becoming a Christian.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You can be religious without being a Christian.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   As I say, the fact that you are religious may be the biggest obstacle of all to your becoming a Christian.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now the apostle has told us all that about himself.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But now tonight I say we are going on a step further.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And I want to suggest to you this evening that in this verse that we're looking at now
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   we are given an explanation of all that which I've just been saying.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Here is really the key to it all.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Now, one is always tempted to say that striking statements
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   are of all statements ever made the most striking.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But I do really put it to you that this is one of the most extraordinary and remarkable things
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   that the apostle ever said.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   What he says here about himself is that he was ignorant.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And that that ignorance was the cause of all his troubles.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   It is particularly remarkable, I think, in view of everything that we saw to be so true
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   about the apostle last Sunday night.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   As I've been reminding you, he was an unusually able man.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   If you're interested in brains, in mental capacity,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   if you're interested in sheer genius,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   if you're interested in the power of thought and of reason and of logic,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the capacity to marshal arguments,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   well, this man is quite in a class and a category on his own.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   One of the great geniuses, one of the great brains of all history.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And yet, you see, what he says about himself was that he was ignorant.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Isn't it astounding?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   But then not only his ability, but his exceptional training.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   However gifted a man may be by nature, that isn't enough.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   A man needs to be trained, and that brain needs to be trained,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   and the better the teacher you have, the better it'll be for you.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Well, Paul was quite exceptionally fortunate in that respect also.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   He sat at the feet of a man called Gamaliel.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Again, one of the greatest teachers that Israel ever produced.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The mighty, the great, the notable Gamaliel.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Here is a man, I say, starting off with this unusual mental equipment,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   has the privilege of sitting at the feet of Gamaliel
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and having the best training and instruction that a man can ever have.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He's been, if you like, to the best university of his time.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And yet what he says about himself is that he was ignorant.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I say this is extraordinary.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I did it ignorantly.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Says this man of all men.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And then, of course, as a result of all this, he was a man of unusual learning.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   He hadn't confined his reading and his study to Jewish law and to Jewish religion.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   He shows quite plainly in his address at Athens that he'd also studied Greek literature.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   He could quote poets.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And that's always a sign of culture, isn't it?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   That's really intellectual.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   He can quote poets.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And he quoted the Greek poets. He knew them. He'd studied them.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You see, he'd been fortunate in being brought up in a city,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   which he says is no mean city.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   The city of Tarsus.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And he'd been born a Roman freeman.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   So he combined in himself the knowledge and the lore of his own Jewish background
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   with this Roman civilization, with this Greek culture and knowledge.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Here is a knowledgeable man, a man of learning, an erudite man.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   A most unusual man judged from that standpoint.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And yet, as I say, what he tells us here about himself is, "I was ignorant."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   That's the whole trouble, he said.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   That was why I stayed outside so long.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   That's why I blasphemed and persecuted.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   That's why I was injurious.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   That was why I wasn't a Christian until that dramatic event on the road to Damascus.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   That's what took me back. That's what blinded me. Ignorance.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And my dear friends, my simple object this evening is to point out and to enforce this message
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   that that is still the explanation of why all people who are not Christian are not Christian.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It is purely and solely and entirely a matter of ignorance.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Now, surely, nothing strikes the modern ear with such a sense of incongruity as that statement.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Because we're all familiar with the fact that what most people today tell us who are not Christian is this,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   that they're not Christians and not even interested in it, well, because of their knowledge.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Isn't that what's being said?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Believe me, the millions of people who are not in a place of worship in this country tonight
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and in other countries in the world are fondly of the opinion and imagining that they are there
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   instead of being in a house of God like this, well, because they're learned.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   They're men of the times. They're moderns. They're up to date.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Why needn't we keep you with this? We're all familiar with it.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The attitude taken towards those of us who are Christian is that we are Christians because we are ignorant.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It's because they say we haven't read enough, because we don't know enough.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They imagine that we've only read the Bible and never read anything else.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   We are not familiar with all this great learning and knowledge that's round and about us.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   They say, "You're just not read. You haven't studied. You haven't thought.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   You've been afraid. The spirit of fear has kept you in.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And you haven't read science. You haven't read philosophy. You don't know.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   If only you knew. If only you expanded your minds. If only you possessed this knowledge.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You'd never be a Christian any longer. It would be impossible. You're ignorant."
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Isn't that the attitude? Why put it so often to you?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   They say it was all right a hundred years ago and more. They didn't know then.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   But look at the advances. Look at the way that knowledge is swept forward.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Look at the heritage we've entered into. This enlightenment, they say.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And yet you see the reply of the apostle still is this.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   The people who talk like that are rarely where they are and what they are simply because they're ignorant.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Far from having enlightenment, they're blinded, he says, by the God of this world they don't know.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's pure ignorance. Not ignorance, if you like, of certain things, but ignorance in a spiritual sense.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Well, now then, what are we to say to this? Well, let me put it like this.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Take this modern suggestion that if a man only has certain particular types of knowledge
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   that he can no longer be Christian and that such people are not Christians because of their knowledge.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   What do we say? Well, I've got two things to say to that. The first is this.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Let me put it first as a dogmatic pronouncement.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I say that there is no new knowledge whatsoever which the world has today
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and which it did not have a hundred years ago which makes the slightest difference to these things.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I'll go further. There is no knowledge that the modern man possesses in any realm or in any department
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   that has to the slightest extent changed the position from what it was when the Apostle Paul was in this world
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   nineteen hundred years ago. None whatsoever.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   There's my dogmatic pronouncement. Let me put it the other way around. Let me put it as a question.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Tell me, what is this new knowledge that has ridiculed Christianity? What is it?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Now, we are being told about it so often. What is it?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   A Christian is not a man who lives in a cell. He's not an anchorite. He's not a hermit.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He's not a man who's living in a sort of glass case.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   The Christians in this congregation tonight have read these subjects, the science, the art, the literature,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   the philosophy and so on, and in the name of all such Christian people I put this question.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   What is the knowledge that the modern man has that makes this out of date and ridiculous?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   The answer is there is no such knowledge.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   What is this fresh knowledge about God that has changed everything?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   What is the fresh knowledge about man that has changed everything?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   What new knowledge is there about man tonight as he is in this world which has put Christianity out of court?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   What is it?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Has it been discovered suddenly that man is absolutely perfect, that he never thinks any wrong and never does any wrong?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Is that it? Well, what is it then?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Is it that if you tell a man the right thing to do that he'll automatically do it?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Is that it? Has that been discovered?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   What is this fresh knowledge about man that denies this and puts it out of court?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Where is it? What is it, I ask? About God? About man?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   What's the fresh knowledge about life?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   "Ah, but you say, 'Look at the diseases we can cure now.'"
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'm talking about life, my friend, not physical well-being or the absence of certain symptoms of disease for the time being.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   What's life? That's the question.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And your science and your medicine haven't added anything to that.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You still don't know any more than what the Bible tells us.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Is there any new additional knowledge about eternity?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Has modern knowledge solved the problem of death and the grave and what lies beyond?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   You see, these are the things we are talking about.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   These are the things that concern us all.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   We live in this world. We are men and women.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   We are living in families.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   We are in these human relationships.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And there are troubles and problems.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Those are the questions.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   What's man? What's life?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   What's it leading to? What's it for?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Well, what's death? Is it the end?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Or does it lead to something? Is there eternity?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Those are the questions.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And you see, your modern knowledge has got nothing to say about them.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It doesn't touch them.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It doesn't begin to consider them.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   There is nothing more fatuous than this idea that modern man, because of what he knows, is not a Christian.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   My friend, it is ignorance that still keeps him from Christ as it kept Paul.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   But let me develop that.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   In what respects is the non-Christian ignorant?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Well, let's take it in the case of the apostle.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   He doesn't hesitate to say it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "I did it ignorantly, in unbelief."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   In spite of his brain, his learning, his training, his knowledge, his erudition.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   "I did it ignorantly."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   What was he ignorant of?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Well, let me try and give you some answers to the question.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I shall give you negative answers mainly this evening.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   The first thing that he was ignorant of, strangely enough, was this.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   He was ignorant concerning himself.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   He never really faced himself.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   All his learning and his knowledge was objective.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Outside himself it was detached.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Now, the Greeks, the Greek philosophers, some of them had stumbled across this truth.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And they said the slogan that should be put and held before men constantly was this.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   "Know thyself."
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   The last thing we learn is that we don't know ourselves, that we are ignorant about ourselves.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   We can be so busy, you see, reading these books and concerned about the problem
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   and trying to get understanding.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   We never bring ourselves into it at all.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   We never face ourselves.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   You see, the great philosopher can be interested in man,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   but somehow seems to forget that he is a man.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Man becomes objectified.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Something outside him on a screen, as it were, he doesn't realize he is talking about himself.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And I suppose that is the ultimate effect of the whole subtlety of the devil,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   that he can get us all to be studying the problem of man,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and yet we are never facing our own problem.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   All objective, all outsiders.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Well, let me put it in this form.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   How is he ignorant about himself?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Well, the first thing that he was ignorant of was his own ignorance.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now, I don't say that just to sound clever.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's the terrible truth.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   He was ignorant of his own ignorance.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You see, with his wrong standard of judgments and of values,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   it had never occurred to him that there was anything that he didn't know.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Because of his learning and his training and so on, he was satisfied.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   He said that he had excelled all his competitors.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   He was always, as I said last Sunday night, on the top of the list in every examination.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   He thought he knew.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   But he suddenly discovered his appalling ignorance.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   He had never known that before.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   He had never been aware of the fact that he was ignorant.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Oh, this is still the same.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   By nature, we are all in the self-same category.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   We are so interested in and concerned about and so proud of what we do know
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   that we've never realized what we don't know.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Yes, a man may master, as I said, philosophy, art, science.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   He may be a musician, a poet in addition.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   He has mastered territory after territory.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But he hasn't yet discovered, he hasn't even begun to contemplate
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   the fact that he's got an appalling ignorance within him as to himself.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   There was once a famous public man here in London,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and in this very century, he once said this.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   He said, "There is no subject competent to the human intellect
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   which I am not able to master if I feel so disposed."
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Striking statement, wasn't it?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   In a sense, you know, he was right.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   He'd walked through his examinations in Oxford.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Every subject he applied his mind to, he could master it.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And he didn't hesitate to say that about himself.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   "There is no subject competent to the human intellect which I cannot master
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   if I feel so disposed."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   He boasted of it.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And he was buried in a drunkard's grave.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Now, that's not a theory, that's a fact.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   He died of what is called cirrhosis of the liver
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   due to excessive consumption of alcohol.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   He can master any subject with which the human intellect is competent to deal.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   He knew from us that he'd never faced his appalling ignorance
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   as to the art or the science of living
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and not killing yourself while you think you're living.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Well, there it is in the case of the apostle Paul,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   there it is in the case of these other men.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   I say that's true of every one of us, in a sense.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I mean, he's so proud of his learning, he hasn't discovered his ignorance.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And his ignorance is always about the most vital things.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   But the apostle tells us he was ignorant of a second thing, and that's this.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   He thought of himself as one who was a real saint.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Do you remember how he puts it in that third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   As touching the righteousness of the law, blameless.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   That's it.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   He's a saint.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He's looked at the demands, the demands and the requests of the law,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   and he can look at them as he thinks and say,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "I have kept them all. I am blameless. He's a saint."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   But he discovered that he was terribly ignorant of what?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Well, of this.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   of whom I am the chief.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   He was ignorant of the fact not only that he was a sinner,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   but that he was in a sense the chief of sinners.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   He didn't know that.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I was ignorant.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   He didn't know that he was a sinner.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   He thought he was a saint.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   He didn't know his position face to face with God.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He thought all was well.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   He discovered his appalling ignorance.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I mustn't stay with this.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   There are other things to be said.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Let me put it all there for us a question before we go any further.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Have you faced yourself, my friend?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Oh, no, I'm not interested in what you know.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I'll grant you anything you may like to claim as an able, educated person.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   I'll admit you've taken a double first in Oxford or Cambridge.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I'll grant you all that.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You are a most knowledgeable person.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   You really have done brilliantly in your examinations.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   You've mastered territory after territory of knowledge,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   but I'm not asking you that.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Do you know yourself?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Have you ever even taken the trouble to sit down to face yourself?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   You see, Paul Heddon and learned men so often don't.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They're objective.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   They're interested in the great problems, never in themselves.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Have you really sat down and spent an evening with yourself,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   talking to yourself and looking at yourself?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Have you seen yourself?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Do you know yourself?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Have you really examined yourself?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Have you found out the truth about yourself,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   your appalling ignorance of yourself?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   No man ever becomes a Christian
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   without first of all getting to know himself from the simple truth about himself.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   It was the thing that held Paul back and kept him out.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   He didn't know himself.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   But let me hurry on.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   The second thing he tells us that he was ignorant of
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   was that he was ignorant of the law of God.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Now this is really still more surprising,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   because if there was one thing, as I've hinted,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   that Paul was exceptionally proud of,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   it was his knowledge of the law of God.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   He was not only a Jew, but he was a Pharisee, you see,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   and a Pharisee of the Pharisees.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   As I say, he'd been trained, as he reminds us,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   in the straightest and the strictest sect of the Pharisees.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   He wasn't a general practitioner.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   He was a consultant, a specialist.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   He wasn't an ordinary man.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   He was the unusual man.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   He was the picked favorite pupil,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   taken out from the rest,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   given the extra information in the very innermost circle.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   If there was one thing he did know,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   it was the law of God.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He'd mastered it, the 613 rules and regulations,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and all about it,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   excelling all others of his contemporaries
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   in his knowledge of the law.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   This was his favorite study, his special interest.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And yet, as he's never tired of telling us
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   what he discovered was his appalling ignorance of the law.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "Well, what do you mean?" says someone.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   "Well, let him answer the question himself."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   He came to see that his whole view of the law was wrong.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Ah, yes, in a sense he did know the details,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   but you see,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   you can miss the wood because of the trees, can't you?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It's possible in any study in this world
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   to be such an expert on details
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   that you really are ignorant of the whole thing.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You've lost yourself in the details.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   There have been many people like that.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   There have been many people who've been so expert
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   on the small things they've missed the big things.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Well, our Lord has said it all so perfectly, hasn't he?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   He turned on people like this one day
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   and he said, "You Pharisees,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   you tithe mint and rue and anise and cumin,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   but you're ignorant of the weightier matters of the law,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   the law of God and things like that."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Oh, yes, they were very careful about these little things.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   They missed the big ones,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and Paul was in exactly the same position.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But we can summarize this very briefly
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   by putting it in these terms.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   He was ignorant of the whole meaning and purpose
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   and spirit of the law.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   You see, his trouble was that he regarded the law
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   as something external,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   just a number of rules and regulations,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   something outside of men.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   What he came to discover, as he tells us there
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   in that 7th of Romans that we read at the beginning,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   was that he found out later that the law was spiritual,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   something inside, not external.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Let me summarize it still more by putting it in this way.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Paul, like a good Pharisee and a typical Pharisee,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   had always thought, you see,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   that as long as you didn't do certain things,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   that you'd kept the law perfectly.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   The law says, for instance, "Thou shalt not kill."
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Well, said Paul to himself,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "I've never murdered anybody,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   therefore I've kept that law absolutely perfectly."
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Yes, you see, what he was ignorant of was this,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   what our Lord and Savior tells us in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   in the 5th chapter of the Gospel,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   according to St. Matthew,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   verses 20 and following.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   That if you say of a man in your heart, "Thou fool,"
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   that you're guilty of murder,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   that it's possible, as Kipling puts it,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   to murder cruger with your mouth,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   killing cruger with your mouth, and so on.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   In other words, that it's your spirit that matters,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   that keeping the law doesn't just mean
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   that you haven't actually murdered the man,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   it means that you love him,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   your enemy is yourself.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Paul likewise thought that the commandment
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   which says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery,"
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   simply meant this,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   that as long as he hadn't committed adultery, actually,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   had never committed that act of adultery,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   that he was not an adulterer.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   But then he didn't know what our Lord said about this,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   that if a man shall even look in the woman for lust with her,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Paul was absolutely ignorant of all that.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It was just a matter of externals.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   He'd never realized that it was the spirit that mattered.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Well, he puts it in this word here, doesn't he?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   He says it's "concupiscence," which means it's coveting.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   He'd never seen that in the law.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   He thought he knew all about it.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   "Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Yes, but he'd forgotten that it also says this,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   not take her, but not commit her even,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   nor the servant, nor the ox, nor the ass," etc.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   The coveting.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   He said, "I was alive without the law once,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   but in the law revived, I saw what it meant,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   and I died.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I was coveting, and I didn't realize
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   that that was the very essence of sin."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   What an appalling ignorance this was of the law, wasn't it?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You see, he'd never seen and had never understood
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   that what matters in the law is the spirit of the law,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   not the letter,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and that what God was doing in the giving of the law
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   was to get men and women to live in the spirit,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   which is his own spirit,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and that therefore, though you may not do this, that,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and the other, you may be a lawbreaker in a terrible sense
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   because you're sinning in your spirit,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and you're coveting, and you're desiring,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and there's lust in you, and that is sin.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   He'd never got this spiritual understanding of the law,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   which he afterwards got,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   and which he expounds in that seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   He had never realized that the whole law can be summed up
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   very simply in these words, as the Son of God put it.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   What, he said, the Pharisee to him one day,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   "What, in your opinion, teacher,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   is the first and the greatest commandment of the law?"
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Here again is a very learned man and expert in the law,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and he and his companions had been having a great debate,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   as they always were debating,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   "Which is the greatest commandment of all?"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   One said this, and another said that.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So they went to Christ to try and catch him.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   They said, "Which is the first and the greatest commandment of all?"
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   And they had the most amazing, astonishing, unexpected reply
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   that ever fell upon a man's ear.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   He said, "This is it.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Not thou shalt not commit adultery,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   not thou shalt not steal, and so on.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   It's this.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   with all thy heart and all thy mind
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and all thy soul and all thy strength,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   and the second is like unto it.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   That's the law.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Not doing this or that,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   not just carrying out this spontaneously.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   What's the law about?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's the revelation of God.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   It's the call us into a relationship with God.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   It's a personal matter.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   It isn't a question of things, of actions.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   It's a personal relationship,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   God and myself,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and the relationship that should subsist between God and myself.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   That's the law.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And Paul was utterly ignorant of the law
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   in which and of which he thought he was an outstanding specialist.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   He was all wrong about it.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He'd missed its spirit, its purpose, its function,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   its very essence and heart,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and all his little detailed knowledge was useless and worthless.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   What an appalling ignorance of the law!
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But still we must go on.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   He discovered also that he was appallingly ignorant of the real nature of sin.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Again, he thought he knew a great deal about sin
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   because he estimated sin in terms of his idea of the law, you see,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and he thought he knew all about it,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   but he discovered when he met Christ and became a Christian
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   that he'd been entirely ignorant of the nature of sin.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   What is it?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Well, he talks about it here when he says that he knows something now
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   about the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   What is this?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Well, take that argument in the 7th of Romans,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   which we read at the beginning.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Let me put it to you in this way.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Paul discovered that sin is not merely a matter of actions
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and of doing this or not doing that.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   He discovered that sin is a deep, powerful principle
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   in the very warp and woof of man's existence
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   that perverts him and twists him and masters him and controls him
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   so that he becomes a helpless slave in its hands.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   You know the classical description, don't you?
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I find a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I delight in the law of God after the inward man.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I see another law in my members,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   warring against the law of my mind
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He didn't know that.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Sin, you see, was just a question of adultery and things like that,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   and as long as he hadn't done that, he wasn't a sinner.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   He now found that within himself,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   in me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   there is some feral principle he discovers within him
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   which is mastering him and controlling him and ruining his life
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   and dragging him down to the depths when he wants to go to the heights.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   That's sin. He didn't know that before.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   But you know he found it was even worse than that.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   He found that sin was as terrible a thing as this.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Sin is so awful that even the law of God
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   which is given to us to teach us about sin
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   and to try to control sin and to prevent our sinning,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   that very law of God which is given to do that
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   actually leads us to sin.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Now I'm not saying that, the Apostle Paul says it. Listen.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   "I had not known sin, he says, but by the law,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   for I had not known lust, except the law had said thou should not covet.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   wrought in me, worked in me all manner of contupitousness,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   for without the law sin was dead."
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Then he goes on and puts it like this.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   "The commandment which was ordained to life,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I found to be unto death,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   for sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   deceived me and by it threw me."
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   What's he mean? Well, let me put it in my words.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   The law came to him and told him that he mustn't do certain things.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Yes, but by telling him not to do certain things,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   the law was bringing those things into his mind
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and into his intellect and his understanding and before his desires.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And what was the result?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Well, sin in Paul was so strong and so powerful
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   that when the law came to him and said thou should not steal,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   he conjured up a possession belonging to another man.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   He hadn't thought of it before, but now he thinks of it.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   The law has made him think of it by telling him not to take it.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He begins to think of it and he plays with it in his imagination
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and in the end he wants it and so he goes and takes it.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Let me speak plainly and bluntly.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   There is nothing that shows such an utter ignorance
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   of the law of God and spiritual conditions
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   as the fatal belief that if you give moral teaching to young people,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   you'll make them moral.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   I don't hesitate to repeat the teaching of the Apostle Paul
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   and I suggest to you that it's being verified in the lives of thousands of people today.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   They are given so-called morality teaching.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   They are told not to do this and not to do that because of certain consequences.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Yes, but you see what's forgotten?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   They forget that these people are sinful
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and that as they are told not to do, they are being introduced to the thing
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   and they begin to fumble it in their imaginations
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and it inflames their passions.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   The very law that is given to prevent sin provokes it,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   stimulates it, works it in him.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Isn't it true?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   A minister of the Gospel once said this to me.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   He said, "Nothing has ever done me greater harm in my life
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   than a book which I once read on the so-called psychology of sex."
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It did me harm, he said.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   I led myself into temptation.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I thought I was doing it for the good motive,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   in order to help myself and to help others.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   But he said it came to me and gave me knowledge and information
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   of which I had been ignorant and it inflamed and it does.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   But I am not concerned simply about morality teaching.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   What I am concerned to show is this,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   that it's there when you realise something like that,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   you realise the true nature of sin.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   You see, unto the pure all things are pure.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Yes, but if you are not pure, even that which is pure will become impure to you.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   And you pretend, of course, that you are reading the book in order to have enlightenment
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and in order to protect yourself.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And you know in your heart of hearts that you are ravished by it and gloating on it
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and you rather like it.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   You feel it's decent to read it in that way.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But what you are really after is the thing that panders to the lust.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   But the Apostle Paul has put it once and forever in this Seventh of Romans,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   "If sin is so powerful that it can even twist and pervert and abuse the law of God,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   well, what is man to fight against such a power
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and how helpless he is when he is face to face with its tyranny."
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   The Apostle Paul was ignorant of sin and that was why he thought he could save himself.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   That was why he thought that by doing certain things he could please God.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   He was ignorant of the real nature of sin.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And that's the real trouble with every man who is not a Christian tonight.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   "Oh," he says, "if I only put my back to it, you know, I could live a good life."
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He may even decide in a service like this to live a good life.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   My dear friend, if you knew what sin is, you'd never try that for a second.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   If you go out of this service tonight saying, "I'm going to be better.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I'm going to make myself a better man. I'm going to use my willpower.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I really must pull myself together. I will be a better man."
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   You're just telling me not only that you're not a Christian,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   but that you don't stand a chance of becoming one at that point
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   because you don't realize that in you is this fell, powerful, awful thing
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   which is called sin, which will even pervert the law of God
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and drag you down and use it even to inflame your passions.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   He was ignorant about sin.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   But, my dear friends, I mustn't keep you.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   The last thing I would mention tonight is this,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   that he was appallingly ignorant of the love and the mercy of God.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   When he wrote to Timothy, he says, "I obtained mercy."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   He knows all about that now.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   But you know, before his conversion, he knew nothing at all about mercy
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and nothing at all about the love of God. Why?
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Well, because he'd never seen any need for it.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   You see, he was self-satisfied and self-contained,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   a Pharisee of the Pharisees,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   keeping as touching the righteousness of the law, blameless.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   A man who's kept it all and who's absolutely perfect,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   who can stand in the presence of God, like the Pharisee depicted by our Lord,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   and all he needs to say is, "I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   and especially as this publican.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I fast twice in the week. I give a tenth of my goods to the poor."
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   He doesn't want anything. He doesn't ask for anything.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   He doesn't need mercy. He isn't familiar with the category.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   It's never entered in. He doesn't know there's such a thing as sin.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   He's never seen himself as a sinner.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He knows nothing about mercy because he's never seen any need of it.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Am I caricaturing a position? Oh, no.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Our Lord himself said that that is exactly the position of the Pharisee.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Paul admits it was his position.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   And you know, I've known many people who are exactly like that.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   They say, "You know, if I said that I was a sinner, I've been told this.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I've been told by people, 'If I said that I was a sinner,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   I really wouldn't be speaking the truth.'"
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   They say, "I've never felt I'm a sinner.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   I really don't know of anything I've done that's wrong."
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   You see, they've got that other idea of sin and of the law.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   They've never seen themselves as sinners.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   They've never felt any need of the mercy and the love and the grace of God.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   They know nothing about it.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And Paul didn't.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   "As Saul of Tarsus, he thought he was satisfying God and fulfilling the law,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   that all was well as it was.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   He knew something about the holiness and the righteousness of God.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   But oh, how ignorant he was of God.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   This mercy, this compassion,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   this long-suffering that he speaks of,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   this patience of God,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   this love of God that pours itself out.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   He knew nothing about it. He was absolutely ignorant.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And that's the trouble with the world tonight and all who are not Christians.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Christ is unnecessary.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   They see no need of him.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Especially his death.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   That's the stumbling block.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Oh, all right as a teacher, but why that death?
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Why do you talk about blood?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   What's the meaning of this atonement?
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Why do you keep on dragging that in?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   They don't want that.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Why not?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Because they're so ignorant of themselves,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and ignorant of God's law,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and God's righteousness.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Ignorant of the sin that's in them,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   which shows itself to the maximum in their self-righteousness and self-satisfaction,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   which makes them think they can even stand before God
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   without an apology and without a request.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   That is the height of sin.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   They've never seen it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   And ignorant of the hell,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   which such self-righteousness deserves and which it will get.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   Ignorant of the fact that if they die like that,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   they'll remain like that to all eternity,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   outside the life of God and his love.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   It's still the same, you see.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   The only man who knows something about the cross
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   is the man who's seen himself as a desperate and a hopeless sinner,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   who realizes that he's never known God,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   that he can never please God by his own efforts,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   that he can't undo his past, he cannot keep the law,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   he doesn't love God and that's what God asks him.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   He doesn't love God with all his being,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   and if he tries, he'll fail.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He sees all that, and he's lost and he's damned, he's hopeless.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And then he hears about this mercy, this love, this compassion,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   this long-suffering, Christ, the Son of God, dying for his sins.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   And oh, with top lady, he says,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   "Fowl, thy to the fountain fly.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Nothing in thy hands I bring, simply.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   To thy cross I cling, naked come to thee for dress,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   helpless look to thee for grace.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Yes, again, fowl, unclean.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I to the fountain fly.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Wash me, Savior, or I die."
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   The need of that, he's discovered it, he's no longer ignorant of it,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   and he finds that the Savior is ready to receive him,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   to wash him, to cleanse him, to renew him with new life,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   to reconcile him, to present him to God,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   to take him by the hand and keep him,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   and eventually share his glory with him.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   My dear friend, what's your position?
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Paul was not a Christian, and it was all due to his ignorance.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   What of you?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Do you know yourself?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Do you know your need?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Do you know the demand that God will make of you
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   when you stand before him at the judgment?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   And do you know that as a helpless, hopeless sinner,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   without waiting a second, you have nothing to do
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   but to accept God's gracious free offer of pardon and forgiveness
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and reconciliation through Jesus Christ his Son,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   who has died for you and for your sins?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Did you know that?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   That's the truth.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   You are no longer able to plead ignorance.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Do you agree to do what Paul did?
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   He says, when all this was revealed to him,
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   He believed he accepted it and began to rejoice in it.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Do likewise.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Amen.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
