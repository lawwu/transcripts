[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Good Monday morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.160]   A big week ahead on the podcast.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080]   Next time on Wednesday, we're gonna look at
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.840]   what we as Christians do with our disordered desires.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.400]   We still have those disordered loves within us.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.240]   So what do we do with them?
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.080]   That's on Wednesday.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.300]   Friday, we look at whether or not we can become more holy
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.540]   if we treat our bodies more harshly,
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.720]   which is a key discussion on asceticism, really important.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.240]   But first up, the week starts
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.640]   as we look at the power of our adversary,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.480]   the devil.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   The Bible tells us that Satan has been disarmed.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840]   So what did he get disarmed of?
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.940]   What powers did he have that he no longer possesses?
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.480]   That's the question from a podcast listener named Dan
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   in Altoona, Iowa.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.360]   Colossians 2.15 tells us our savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.360]   disarmed the rulers and authorities
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.880]   and put them to open shame by triumphing over them.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.440]   It's a great text.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   But what is here meant by disarmed?
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.320]   Was there something they were wielding then
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.360]   that they do not wield now?
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   And if so, what is the weapon Paul speaks of
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.520]   here in this text?
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.720]   - I love this question because I love the glorious truth
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.680]   not only of Colossians 2.15,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680]   but the way verses 13 and 14 prepare for it
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   and put a massive foundation under it.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800]   So let's read the whole unit
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.120]   and then I'll give a couple answers to the question,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.600]   in what sense did the death of Christ strip Satan
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.520]   and his demons of their weapons?
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.220]   Here's the verses.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.040]   And you who were dead in your trespasses
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.200]   and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   God made alive together with him, with Christ.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.320]   Having forgiven us all our trespasses, how?
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.520]   By canceling the record of debt
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.800]   that stood against us with its legal demands,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.080]   this he set aside, how?
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   Nailing it to the cross.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   And here comes the key verse we're being asked about.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.520]   He disarmed, this is verse 15,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.840]   he disarmed the rulers and authorities
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240]   and put them to an open shame
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   by triumphing over them in him, in Christ and in the cross.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.480]   This is one of the greatest passages I think in the Bible
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   about what really happened when Christ died.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   So let me describe seven terrible and wonderful things
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.840]   in the order in which they happened in this text
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.880]   and end by describing the glorious disarming
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400]   of rulers and authorities.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.080]   First, we were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.360]   All human beings are spiritually dead and blind
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.240]   to the reality of the glory of Christ.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.320]   We are as dead to spiritual truth
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.920]   as a human corpse is dead to being touched.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.600]   Paul describes the legal nature of this condition
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.640]   in verse 14 with the phrase,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   a record of debt stood against us with its legal demands.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   In other words, we're not only spiritually impervious
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.880]   to God's touch, but we are legally condemned
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.300]   by the long record of sins that stood against us.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   Second, God took that long list, that record of sins,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.320]   and put it in the hand of Christ
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.780]   and drove a spike through it and through his hand
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.780]   so that he became a substitute for us
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.200]   bearing the punishment for the record of our debts
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.340]   in his own death.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.920]   He nailed it.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.020]   The text says he nailed it to the cross.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020]   Third, then verse 14 makes explicit
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.040]   that this nailing of the record of our debt to the cross
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.340]   canceled, it canceled the record of our debt.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.420]   It is canceled.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.500]   The debt is canceled because the debt of punishment
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.980]   that we owe to the justice of God has been paid
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.460]   in the punishment of Christ on the cross.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.540]   Fourth, then Paul adds,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.060]   he set the record of our sins aside.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.920]   Literally, it says he took it out of the midst.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960]   Very unusual thing to say.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.400]   In other words, in the courtroom of heaven
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   where our record of debt guarantees our condemnation,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.100]   nobody can find it.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.520]   It's taken.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.080]   Where did it go?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.560]   This was in a folder here just a minute ago.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.440]   It's taken out of the midst.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.120]   It is gone as far as the east is from the west.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.660]   So far does he remove our transgressions from us.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.280]   Fifth, then he makes explicit that the effect
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.240]   of our sins being nailed and the record of debt
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.800]   being taken out of the way, the effect is we're forgiven.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.620]   He applies to us personally
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.340]   what Christ accomplished perfectly.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.420]   When we are united to Christ by faith,
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.400]   his punishment becomes ours
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.420]   and his righteousness becomes ours
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.420]   and God counts our sins against us no more.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.740]   Sixth, Paul says in verse 13,
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.520]   "Therefore God made us alive with him."
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   Because our sins are forgiven, he makes us eternally alive.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.780]   Now we're no longer a corpse anymore
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.360]   that can't be touched by spiritual reality.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.400]   We see Christ for who he is and we are moved
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.320]   to prefer him and prize him and treasure him
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   and love him and trust him above all things.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.040]   And now on the basis of those six terrible
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   and glorious realities, we see in verse 15
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   that something amazing happened to the rulers
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   and authorities to Satan and his cosmic forces
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.700]   in the heavenly places.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.280]   As it says in Ephesians 6,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.800]   "He disarmed," this is verse 15,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.360]   "He disarmed the rulers and authorities
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.640]   and put them to an open shame, triumphing over them in him."
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   The word translated disarmed means literally stripped.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.120]   It's used one other place, namely in chapter three,
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.280]   verse nine, where the Christians are to strip off
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.080]   their old nature.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   So what we see first in verse 15 is that just when people
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.440]   thought Jesus was being stripped of his clothing
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.000]   and shamed in nakedness at his final trial
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.560]   and led in triumphal procession to Calvary,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.320]   what was really happening was the reverse,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.860]   namely Satan and his demonic forces were being stripped,
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.280]   they were being shamed,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.920]   they were being led in triumphal procession.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.460]   And I see three ways, or I'm only gonna mention two,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.640]   there are more, two ways that the achievement
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.720]   of the death of Jesus in verses 13 and 14
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.900]   bring about this stripping or this disarming
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.520]   of Satan and his rulers.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.020]   First, we know from Revelation 12, 10,
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.720]   that Satan, by the very meaning of his name,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.000]   is the great accuser.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.340]   Satan can do a lot of damage to us,
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.380]   physically, emotionally, relationally, in this world,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.180]   but he can only condemn us or damn us
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.040]   or bring us to eternal ruin in one way,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   namely by a valid accusation of our sins before a holy God.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.020]   If he can do that, we're done for.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.020]   If he can make our sins stick in the courtroom of heaven
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.500]   as he accuses us before the judge of the universe,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.540]   we're doomed, we're hopeless.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.620]   And the point of verses 13 and 14
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.660]   is that the record of death that Satan could use
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.360]   to accuse us and condemn us has been nailed to the cross.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.180]   The one damning weapon that he has,
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.900]   namely unforgiven sin, with which he could accuse us,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.820]   has been stripped out of his hands.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.020]   This is what Paul meant, I think,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.380]   when he said in Romans 8, 33,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.180]   who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.820]   It is God who justifies who is to condemn.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.560]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.080]   So the first way that the demonic world
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.540]   was stripped and disarmed by the cross
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.540]   is that the power to accuse God's people successfully
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.540]   has been taken away.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.140]   That sin is already punished.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.040]   It was nailed to the cross.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.380]   We can't be accused with it.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.380]   And the second thing, the only other thing I'll mention,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.580]   is a glorious thing experientially now,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.440]   namely Satan was robbed.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.460]   The powers and the rulers, the authorities were robbed
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.460]   of a script of their power to hold us in slavery
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.340]   to the fear of death.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.300]   Now I get that straight out of Hebrews 2, 14,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.880]   which is an absolutely amazing, wonderful verse.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.040]   Since therefore the children, that's us,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.020]   share in flesh and blood, that is, we're human,
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.660]   he himself, that's Christ,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.980]   likewise partook of the same nature, he became human,
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.660]   that through death, so he became human so he could die,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.900]   that through death, that's what happened in Colossians 2, 14,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   he might nullify the one who has the power of death,
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.720]   that is the devil.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.820]   Nullify, abrogate, revoke, abolish.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.380]   When Christ died in our place,
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.200]   he took the sting out of death
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.700]   because he took sin out of death.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.500]   He took condemnation out of death,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.160]   and so he took fear out of death,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   which means that the second great weapon of the devil
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.680]   that was stripped from him is the power to hold us
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.380]   in bondage, which is what the next verse in Hebrew says,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.260]   he held us in bondage through the fear of death
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.260]   our whole life long, and he can't do that anymore.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.520]   He has been disarmed of the weapon of fear of dying
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.980]   because the sting of death is sin,
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.120]   and the power of sin is the law,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   and all of it has been satisfied and punished on the cross.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.520]   So you can see why I love Colossians 2, 13 to 15.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.140]   The riches of these verses are infinite,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.140]   and I encourage you to spend hours pondering the glories
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.540]   of what God achieved for us on the cross,
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.580]   especially as it relates to the devil
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.420]   and the evil rulers and authorities,
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.860]   and I've only mentioned two.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.280]   There are other ways that Satan has been stripped,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.540]   but these two are wonderful.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.160]   The power to condemn us with sin, stripped.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.980]   Power to terrify us with death, stripped.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.540]   - Amen, Colossians 1 and 2 are stunning chapters.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.380]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.460]   for walking us through this text in Colossians 2, 15,
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.260]   and Dan in Altoona, Iowa, great question.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.000]   Thanks for sending the question in
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.500]   and taking the time to write it out for us.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.460]   If you have a great Bible question for Pastor John,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.900]   send it to us at our online home
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.420]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.060]   Well, next up, we talk about divided hearts.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.180]   What do we do with these divided hearts of ours,
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.340]   these hearts still struggling with inordinate desires,
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.300]   inordinate loves?
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.340]   That's up next time.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.740]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday for that.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.560]   See you then.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
