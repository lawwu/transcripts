[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, entitled "Witness in the Power of the Spirit",
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.520]   was given on the OMF ship Doulos on the 18th of September 1978.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.200]   The noise you can hear in the background are the ship's generators,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.400]   which are running all the time the ship is operational.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:28.160]   I would like in a very brief word just to give my thanks and express my sense of privilege
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.040]   of being asked to be here tonight, and I deeply appreciate the very kind words
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.680]   which have been spoken. It is indeed a very great privilege, and if I may say so,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.000]   as a man of my age I'm immensely encouraged by seeing such a great crowd of young people
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.040]   who not only believe in the Word of God and in the God of the Word, but were also concerned
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.160]   about their fellow men and women, and are anxious to do everything they can to make this good news
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.120]   known to the masses throughout the entire world. Well now, I want to read to you some verses
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.360]   out of the fifth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, starting at verse 12.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   The book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 5, beginning at verse 12.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.560]   And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.000]   and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch; and of the rest does no man join himself
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.560]   to them, but the people magnified them. And believers were the more added to the Lord,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.520]   multitudes both of men and women, insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.320]   and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.960]   might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.440]   Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   healed every one. Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, which is the
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.840]   sect of the Sadducees, and were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.720]   and put them in the common prison. But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.520]   and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand, and speak in the temple to the people
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.880]   all the words of this life. And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.160]   morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.240]   together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.960]   But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, saying,
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keeper standing outside
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   before the doors; but when we had opened, we found no men within.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.400]   Now when the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   they were perplexed concerning them, how this would grow. Then came one, and told them, saying,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.880]   Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence; for they feared
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   the people, lest they should have been stoned. And when they had brought them, they set them
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.160]   before the council, and the high priest asked them, saying, Did not we straightly command you
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   that ye should not preach in this name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.720]   and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. Then Peter, and the other apostles, answered, and said,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   We are to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.520]   whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince,
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:43.920]   and a saviour, and to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:55.840]   of these things; and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.240]   Now I want to deal particularly with that last verse, the thirty-second verse, in this fifth
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. And we are his witnesses of these things;
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:20.000]   and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.120]   Now I think it must be clear to all of us that what we are dealing with here
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   is an account of one of the early persecutions endured and suffered by the infant Christian
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.240]   church. Here was the church. She had only just come into being. There were a comparatively
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   small number of people in a great antagonistic society. The Jews were against them, and the
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.120]   Gentiles, pagans, were all against them. And now they are suffering active persecution.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:07.840]   Peter and John, two of the apostles, had already been on trial. But they had been set at liberty,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.040]   and they had gone on with the work. And now the entire company of the apostles had been arrested
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.360]   and thrown into prison. But in a marvellous, miraculous manner, they had escaped, and they
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.200]   were back again preaching in the temple. This news reached the great council in Jerusalem,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.160]   that was determined to put an end to Christianity. So they sent their officers to arrest the apostles
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:41.440]   once more. And here they are on trial before this greatest court in the land, called the Sanhedrin.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   And they are charged, you see, with doing what had been prohibited, namely, preaching and teaching
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.000]   in the name of this Jesus. And then we are told that Peter got up and answered for himself and
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.240]   the other apostles, and uttered these words, "We are to obey God rather than men. The God of our
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.320]   fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.480]   to be a prince and a saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.360]   his witnesses of these things. And so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.000]   that obey him." Now, I call your attention to it for this reason, that I believe we are back again
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.960]   in a position that is strangely similar to that of the early church. We are in a pagan world.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.760]   We live in pagan countries. People used to talk at one time of Christian countries. I don't believe
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   there's ever been such a thing, but they don't even talk about such now, because this country
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   in which we're meeting tonight is a pagan country. All the great countries, all the countries of the
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   world are pagan countries. And as you know, there is great opposition to the gospel,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:18.000]   not only communism, but humanism, every kind of ism. And in many ways, the Christian gospel
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.200]   is fighting for our life once more, and the church is fighting for our life again.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.320]   So the great question that confronts us is this, how are we to meet such a situation?
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Or putting it in a different way, how are you good friends to face this problem of evangelism?
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:48.560]   What can we do in this present world? Well, it's because I feel we have the answer to those
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.760]   questions in this statement that I call your attention to it. The first thing, of course,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:05.360]   that is stressed and that is obvious is this, that we must be absolutely certain of our authority.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:18.000]   We ought to obey God rather than men. Now, if this isn't true of us, all our efforts are going to be
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.800]   in vain. And I believe that much of the failure of the Christian church during this present century
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.160]   has been due to this fear of men. The church has been afraid of educated people.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   She's been intending to say in the past the masses were ignorant, but now there's been popular
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:48.880]   education and people are reading newspapers and books and so on and learning about science. They
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.520]   began to feel apologetic and nervous and afraid, afraid what people might think and what people
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:04.560]   might say. So instead of submitting to the authority and the command of God and the Word of
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.840]   God, they've been accommodating the message in a spirit of fear. And the result is that they've
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   lost their authority and nobody is prepared to listen to them. It's not surprising. This is basic.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:29.360]   This is absolute. We don't preach our own message. It's the message of God. That's our authority.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.000]   And though there may be great opposition against us, we mustn't be afraid of it. Why?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.720]   Well, because we are servants of the living God, the God who can do impossible things,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:54.000]   the God of the miraculous, the God of the supernatural. We've got to get rid of any fear
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.840]   of man, fear of men's intellects, fear of their power, fear of their influence, anything which
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:11.040]   tempts us to be afraid of men. We must get rid of it and we must have this holy boldness that was
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:18.800]   such a characteristic of these apostles. Now, you remember, don't you, that they hadn't always been
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:26.080]   like this? Here is this spokesman, the apostle Peter. You remember how, but a few weeks before,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:34.400]   he had denied his Lord and Savior. Why? Well, because he was afraid. He was afraid he was going
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.880]   to be arrested. You remember the story how when our Lord was put on trial, Peter slipped into the
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.640]   courtroom wanting to hear what was going to happen, but a girl recognized him, a servant girl
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   recognized him and challenged him. She said, "You belong to him," and he denied it three times
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.800]   with oaths and cursing. Why? Because he was a coward, because he was afraid he was going to
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:09.040]   lose his life or to be punished. But now here he is, the same man, standing before the highest court
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   in the land, a court that has the authority and the power to throw him into prison or even to put
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:22.000]   him to death, and he's not a bit afraid of them. He looks at them and he says, "We ought to obey God
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.400]   rather than you." He's not afraid of the greatest human authority because he is afraid of God and
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:41.760]   is submitted entirely to God and his word and his power. I need say no more about that. But do
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:49.600]   remember this. You must go not in your own strength, but in the strength of the Lord and in
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   the power of his might. Don't be afraid of ridicule or of arguments or apparent superiority on the
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.720]   parts of others. We've nothing to apologize for. We are speaking to a bankrupt world. It puts up a
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.360]   great pretence of learning, but it's utterly ignorant. Don't be afraid of it. Speak with a
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:26.400]   holy boldness, fearing God, but not fearing man. "Fear him, ye saints," said John Bunyan, "and you
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:35.760]   will have nothing else to fear. If we work in the fear of the Lord, we shall soon lose
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.160]   the fear of man." But as I say, I'm particularly concerned about this 32nd verse
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:50.000]   because here I think is something that we all need to be reminded of at a time like this.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:02.480]   The apostle says that there are two strands or two elements which are absolutely necessary
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:11.680]   to a successful witness or successful work for our Lord and his kingdom. And they are these.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:24.160]   We, we are his witnesses. But he goes on to say, "So is also the Holy Spirit."
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.600]   There's another witness. And the apostle, you notice, puts the two together. And the point I
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:42.400]   would like to leave with you and to impress upon your minds and hearts is this, that these two are
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.320]   absolutely essential and must always go together. Now, why do I say that? Well, for this reason,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.320]   that as I see things at the present time, I find that in the main, there are two groups of
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:04.960]   Christians today. The one, the first group, puts the whole of its emphasis upon the first element.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:14.400]   We are his witnesses. In other words, the apostolic witness, the message of the Bible,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.760]   the word of God. Now, these friends look out upon the world like everybody else,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.160]   and they see the state of the church and our comparative impotence. And they say,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.080]   "There's only one thing necessary. We must come back to the reformed faith.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:41.760]   We must come back to doctrine. We must come back to theology." And they say, "It's the only thing
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:49.600]   that is necessary." And they give the whole of their time in propagating that particular message.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.000]   They say, "The trouble is that the church has gone astray in her doctrine. And while she is wrong in
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.120]   her doctrine, she can't achieve anything very well. There's only one thing to do. We must bring them
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:08.720]   back to the orthodox doctrine, to the true faith." And they stop at that. Well, now, as I'm going to
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:16.800]   suggest, it is essential that we should be orthodox. A church that doesn't know what she
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:26.960]   believes is not a church. We must be certain of our message. And we must return, if we've ever
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:35.520]   departed from it, to the apostolic faith, the apostolic message, the message that we have in
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:43.120]   this book that we call the Bible. This is an absolute necessity. It's quite right. The church
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:51.280]   is as she is today, very largely because she's been departing from the faith. People have put
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.520]   philosophy, the opinions of men, instead of the revelation of the Word of God. So they're right
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:07.760]   in saying that we've got to come back to the Bible and its message, to the apostolic message,
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:16.800]   to the apostolic witness. But the trouble is that they stop at that and say that no more is necessary.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   But then you see there's another group, and a group that is fairly prominent at the present time,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.480]   who says, looking at the same situation, that the only thing that is necessary
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.360]   is the witness of the Spirit. Now, these friends who belong to the second group,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   they say that more or less it doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter whether you
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:55.360]   believe that the Virgin Mary is co-redemptrix with Christ or not. It doesn't matter whether
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.560]   you believe in the so-called miracle of transubstantiation, the bread being turned
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.360]   into the literal body of Christ. It doesn't matter whether you pray to the saints or not.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.800]   It doesn't matter whether you believe in popes and cardinals and confess your sins to the priest.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   They say it doesn't matter. Only one thing matters, and that is that you have the powerful
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.600]   witness of the Spirit within you. Now, you must be familiar with all this. And the trouble is that
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.800]   these two groups are tending to polarize and to harden from each other. The point being that each
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:42.080]   one says that this alone is necessary. Doctrine, theology alone is necessary, says the first group.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:49.680]   No, says the second, it is the power of the Spirit alone that is necessary, and theology
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.280]   doesn't matter. Well, now, I want to suggest to you tonight that they're both right and they're
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.960]   both wrong. They're both right in the particular emphasis, but they're wrong when they stop at the
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:12.240]   one or the other. For the fact is that you can be perfectly orthodox, but at the same time
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:21.200]   perfectly dead. I've known individuals, I've known denominations that were rigidly orthodox and
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.760]   correct in the whole of their teaching, but they never knew what it was to see a soul converted.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:36.640]   They never even expected it. Their witness is negative, almost non-existent. Why? Because they
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:46.960]   stopped at the first element only and didn't realize the absolute necessity of the power of
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:55.200]   the Holy Spirit also. But on the other hand, there are people who undoubtedly have been filled with
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:02.400]   the Spirit, but because they say that doctrine is irrelevant and immaterial and doesn't matter,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:10.560]   have gone into a state of fanaticism. Wildfires come in. They have forgotten that the New
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:18.400]   Testament tells us to prove and to try the Spirit, and the result has been chaos and disaster,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:27.600]   not only in their witness, but quite often even in their own personal lives and conduct and behavior.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:37.360]   The point is that unless you take these two things together as the Apostle puts them before us,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.240]   and as the whole Bible puts them before us, you will achieve nothing. So you, my friends,
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.200]   and I with you, and anybody else who's privileged to preach and present the gospel,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.880]   we've got to be quite sure that we are holding these two things together at the same time.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:03.040]   The message of the Word, yes, but the power of the Spirit upon the Word. I don't hesitate to assert
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:12.000]   that the Word alone without the Spirit can be utterly ineffectual, and the Spirit without the
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:23.040]   Word is in grave danger of producing a false or a wildfire. Very well. In order to prove my
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   contention, I don't apologize in this heat in proving my point to you. I think it's so important
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:41.680]   that we must realize the absolute necessity of having these two elements, that it must be
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.160]   demonstrated beyond any doubt, and I prove it in this way. Let us look for a moment
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:59.920]   at our blessed Lord and Savior himself. Here is the very Son of God incarnate in this world.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:12.080]   He's come from eternity. He's entirely free from sin or any taint of sin. He's described
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.680]   as the Archangel, as that holy thing to which Mary was going to give birth. Here he is,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:30.800]   in all the perfection of his being as God and man. Very well. He sets out in his public ministry
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:39.280]   at the age of 30, but you remember what happened. He went to be baptized by John the Baptist.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.000]   John was reluctant to do so, but after a little conversation, John consented,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.880]   and our Lord was baptized by John the Baptist in the river Jordan. Yes, but you remember what
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:01.040]   happened. We can't tell for certain whether he was still standing in the river or walking up out of
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:10.640]   it, but while still in the water, we are told that the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:22.320]   a dove, and a voice came from him saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:32.480]   It was from that moment that his public ministry began. Not until then. It was after the Spirit
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.720]   had descended upon him in the form of a dove. Now we've got proof of this. If you turn to the fourth
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:47.120]   chapter of Luke's Gospel, you will find the first verse reads like this, "And Jesus, being full of
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.920]   the Holy Spirit." Well, now there was a sense in which he was always full of the Holy Spirit. This
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.800]   is a reference to what had happened to him in the Jordan when the Spirit had come upon him,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   and then we are told that he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, and there follows the account
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:17.840]   of the temptation. But then resuming in verse 14, we read, "And Jesus returned in the power of the
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:25.920]   Spirit into Galilee." Now this is something new. He returned in the power of the Spirit, the Spirit
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.160]   that had come upon him when he was there in the Jordan, and then we are told how he went back to
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.400]   Nazareth and went into the synagogue on the Sunday, and they delivered him a portion of a scroll of
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:45.360]   the prophet Isaiah. And when he had found the place wherein it was written, he began to read this,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:56.320]   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me." Upon me. He'd come upon him in the river Jordan,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.080]   because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the broken
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:10.560]   hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, etc., etc. And he began to say unto them, "This
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:21.920]   day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." In other words, he's saying, "I am the anointed
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.400]   preacher of whom Isaiah spoke, and the Spirit of the Lord has come upon me, and he's upon me,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.240]   and he's anointed me to preach. I am suggesting to you that without what had happened to him at
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:41.840]   the Jordan, he could not have exercised his public ministry as our savior and mediator,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.200]   as the one who brings to us and us to the kingdom of God." Here in the case of our Lord himself,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:57.280]   why do I say this? Well, for this reason, that there are people who tell us that as long as we
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   are regenerate, we need nothing more. That any man who's regenerate has everything. Well, our Lord
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.760]   was not regenerate. You can't use the term about him. He was never anything else.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   He was always perfect. He was always Son of God, Son of Man. Yet even he could not have carried
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:27.680]   out his ministry without this special endowment of power that came upon him there in the river
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.840]   Jordan. And of course, if you turn to John's gospel, you'll find that John says this in chapter 3,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:42.560]   "That God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him." He gives the Spirit by measure to us,
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.040]   but he doesn't give the Spirit by measure unto him. And in the sixth chapter of John's gospel,
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:55.920]   you will read that our Lord, referring to himself, said, "Him hath God the Father
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:05.680]   sealed." Sealed. He set his seal upon him. When did he do so? At the Jordan, by sending the Spirit
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.480]   upon him. You remember how John the Baptist said that he'd been told that the one on whom he saw
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:20.240]   the Spirit coming as a dove, that was the Messiah. So all these scriptures taken together,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:28.560]   and I could give you others, clearly indicate to us that even in the case of our Lord himself,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:37.360]   though Son of God, perfect Son of Man, it was necessary in order that he might perform his
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.440]   works, that he should have the Spirit in this special manner. Indeed, we are told in the epistle
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:51.520]   to the Hebrews that he gave himself through the eternal Spirit. Very well. There's the case of
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:58.560]   our Lord. Well, now let's have a look at these disciples, these apostles, these first preachers.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.640]   So I take you to the first chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.440]   And there we are told that in verse four, being assembled together with them,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:14.320]   he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:21.120]   which saith he, Ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:29.840]   baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence. And then in verse eight, But ye shall receive
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:37.440]   power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you. And you shall be witnesses unto me, both in
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.080]   Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the outermost parts of the world. What's he saying?
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:51.440]   Well, what he's saying is this, that until they had received this special endowment of power
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:58.240]   through the Spirit, they could not be his witnesses. Now, this is a very remarkable statement
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:05.680]   because he would have imagined that no men were in a better or a more perfect position to be
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:12.720]   witnesses to our Lord than these very disciples. They'd been with him for three years. They'd heard
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.000]   all his preaching, all his messages, all his teaching. He'd answered their questions. They'd
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.560]   seen all his miracles. They'd seen him crucified. They'd seen him dead. They'd seen him buried.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.080]   They'd seen him risen. And he'd been with them for a number of days. Well, you would have thought
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.480]   that they were perfect witnesses. Who could have been more perfect as witnesses? They have the
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   complete message. And yet he tells them that as they are, they cannot be his witnesses, that
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:54.240]   they've got to wait until they receive this power of the Spirit, this baptism with the Spirit.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:02.320]   Then and only then will they be his witnesses in Judea, Jerusalem in Judea, and in all these
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   other places. It's the same thing once more. And as you remember, this is what happened to them on
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:16.160]   the day of Pentecost. And from there on, they began to be mighty witnesses. I've already referred to
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.960]   the case of Peter, the transformation in this man who denied his Lord now preaches him with boldness
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:30.320]   and is afraid of nobody. And as a result of one sermon on the day of Pentecost, three thousand
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.560]   souls were converted to the Lord. Well, now I could take you through other passages and other
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.760]   chapters in this book of the Acts of the Apostles, and you will find exactly the same thing. This is
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:52.560]   the great emphasis that is found here everywhere. So I draw this conclusion that a mere knowledge of
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:31:01.600]   the facts and of the truth is not enough in itself. It is essential. The apostles had it.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:12.080]   We can have it. But without the power and the attestation of the Spirit, we shall not be
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:19.520]   triumphant and we shall avail very little as witnesses. And as you remember, the apostle Paul
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   is always emphasizing this thing. He tells the Corinthians that he came to them in weakness and
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.560]   in fear and in much trembling. And his speech and his preaching was not with enticing words of man's
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:37.440]   wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. You remember how he tells the Thessalonians,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:44.160]   "Our gospel came unto you," he said, "not in word only." It did come in word, and there must be the
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:53.200]   word. There must be the apostolic truth. But it's not enough. But also in power, in the Holy Ghost,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:01.440]   and with much assurance. That was the secret of this man and all the other apostles and all the
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:08.240]   other preachers. Not the word only, not the apostolic witness only, not the Spirit only,
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.680]   but the power of the Spirit upon the word. Very well. There is my first point.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.200]   But now I must go on to a second point, which is this.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:30.720]   Someone may say to me, "If then you say that this witness of the Spirit is also necessary and
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:39.840]   essential, to what does the Holy Spirit bear witness?" Now this is a very acute problem
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:46.000]   with many people at the present time. How do you know when you're filled with the Spirit?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:56.160]   To what does the Holy Spirit bear his witness? It's a very, very important question.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.160]   As I say, there are many who say that doctrine and understanding are quite unnecessary.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.920]   All you need is the power of the Spirit. Very well. To what does the Spirit witness?
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:19.600]   And I must first answer with a negative. The Holy Spirit does not bear witness to himself.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:28.000]   The Holy Spirit does not call attention to himself, nor to his works, nor to his own power.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Never. Neither does he bear witness to us, nor even to any gifts that he may have given us.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.280]   Well, then you say, "To what does the Holy Spirit bear witness?"
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   Well, there's no difficulty about answering this. I read this in John chapter 15, verse 26.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:58.560]   Our Lord says, "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:08.080]   even the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:19.840]   of me." Me. Not of himself, but of me, Son of God. And then you remember in the next chapter,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   chapter 16, our Lord puts this still more explicitly. In verse 13 I read, "Nevertheless,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   of, or out of, or from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:35:01.120]   show you things to come. He will glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.840]   unto you." What could be plainer? The Holy Spirit came in the form of a dove.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:16.800]   I believe that was very deliberate, to suggest the shyness, the fact that he doesn't
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:26.240]   demonstrate himself, as it were, a delicacy, a shyness. And the Holy Spirit has been specifically
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:36.000]   sent for one great purpose. What's that? To testify to the Lord Jesus Christ. To glorify
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.840]   the Lord Jesus Christ. Not himself, not anything that he does. He does marvelous things to us,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:53.760]   all right. But he doesn't call attention to that. He calls attention to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:02.080]   and to his person, and to his works. He was sent specifically to do that. Have you ever noticed
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   this in reading the Gospels? That our Lord was always very careful to say that he did not speak
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:15.360]   of, or out of himself either. That the Father had given him the works to do, the Father had given
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:24.320]   him the words to speak. He comes to glorify the Father, and the Spirit has come to glorify the
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:33.840]   Son. To call attention to him, his person, and his teaching, and his works. Now this, I say,
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:41.280]   is something that I really must emphasize, because there seems to be a tendency today among certain
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   good, honest, sincere friends, to think that the sign that you are filled with the Spirit is
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.160]   that you're always talking about the Spirit. I've noticed that some of them even have conferences,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.600]   and I've made a careful point of observing what they're advertised to do in their conferences.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.960]   I had a letter only last week telling me a friend had been to a certain conference,
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:13.600]   even last Good Friday, Good Friday of all days. And he said the Lord Jesus Christ and his death
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:21.040]   were literally not mentioned throughout the day conference. All the talk was about the Holy
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.760]   Spirit. Well now my friends, this is not scriptural. This is even a denial of the Scripture.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:39.440]   The Spirit is not to witness to himself, but to the Lord, me. He shall glorify me. And you see,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.800]   that's exactly what Peter tells us at this particular point. We are his witnesses, he says,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:55.040]   of these things. So is also the Holy Spirit. He's a witness of what? These things. Well,
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.760]   what are these things? Well, he has told us. This is what he says face to face with the Sanhedrin.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:11.200]   He says that we should obey God rather than men. And then he goes on to say,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:21.680]   "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.640]   exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, to give repentance to Israel
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:35.040]   and forgiveness of sins." That's what we are witnesses to, says Peter. That is what the Holy
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:43.920]   Spirit witnesses to. It's the Lord, his person and his work. These things, not to himself,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.360]   not to his own wonderful works. Now, this is not an isolated statement.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:01.200]   This is what is said constantly. You remember that our Lord said at that last day of the feast,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.120]   as recorded in the seventh chapter of John's gospel, that it was going to be true of Christian
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.200]   people that living water should flow from their bellies, from their innermost part.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:20.400]   This speak he of the spirit that they which believe on him should receive. This is the teaching
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:27.840]   in prophecy and in fulfillment. But I'm particularly concerned now about the fulfillment of this.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.360]   And this is what amazes me, that anybody can ever go astray about this. You see, it shows the
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:41.840]   importance of always being scriptural, of always testing any experience or anything else in terms
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:50.000]   of the scripture. And I am contending for this, that the real proof of the fact that a man is
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.200]   filled or baptized with the spirit is that he glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ, not the spirit,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:06.400]   still less himself or his experiences or his gifts. Now, let me demonstrate this to you.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:15.120]   Look at Acts 2 with its marvelous account of the day of Pentecost and the descent of the Spirit
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:22.800]   upon the apostles and the others that were with them in the upper room. You remember what happened.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.680]   This was an amazing event. And strange things happened to these people. And it became known
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.800]   throughout all Jerusalem. And the crowd came rushing together from everywhere. They were all
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.920]   amazed and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What meaneth this?" Others, mocking, said,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:50.480]   "These men are full of new wine. They're drunk." Then I'm told Peter, standing up with the eleven,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:56.400]   lifted up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:03.360]   be this known unto you and hearken to my voice. These are not drunk, as ye suppose, seeing it is
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.880]   but the third hour of the day, but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." And then
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:17.120]   he proceeds to quote the prophet Joel. Then having quoted Joel, he begins to preach and to apply the
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:26.880]   message. And you get it in verse 22. "Ye men of Israel, hear these words. Now then, here's a man
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:34.320]   who's just been filled to overflowing with the Spirit, bursting as it were with the energy of
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.960]   the Spirit, thrilling with the power of the Spirit." What does he preach about? Does he preach
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:47.840]   about the experience he's just had? Does he preach about the Holy Spirit? This is the answer. "Ye
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:57.760]   men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth," that's what the Spirit always does. He
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:05.040]   always calls attention to the Lord Jesus Christ. Not to himself, Jesus of Nazareth. And he goes on
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.120]   to tell them, "A man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.080]   him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know, him being delivered by the determinate
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him by wicked hands and crucified him, whom God
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.680]   hath raised up." What's he preaching about? Jesus Christ, his person, his death, his resurrection,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:36.400]   his great salvation. That's what the Spirit did immediately. He didn't call attention to himself.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.840]   Neither did he call attention to Peter, nor to the gifts that they had just received.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:49.280]   But that's only the first example. Go along to chapter 3. And there you have the famous
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.240]   account, you remember, of how Peter and John one afternoon were going up to the temple to pray.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:03.440]   Suddenly, they were accosted by a poor man who was sitting just outside the beautiful gate of
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:11.360]   the temple. He was a man over 40 years of age who'd never walked in his life. He'd been born lame.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.240]   He'd never been able to walk. But you remember how, after a very brief conversation,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:22.800]   Peter said to him, "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:30.320]   And the man immediately sprang to his feet. His feet and ankle bones had received strength,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:37.120]   and in a few moments, there he was, not only walking, but leaping and praising God and going
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.880]   into the temple. Well, of course, it was another tremendous incision. And the whole town came
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:51.520]   rushing together, greatly wondering. And when Peter saw it, verse 12 of chapter 3,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   he answered the people, "Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? Or why look ye so earnestly
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:12.080]   on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? Don't look at us,"
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:18.640]   says Peter. "Don't be interested in us. It isn't we who've done this." Well, who's done it? Listen.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:27.920]   "The God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son,
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:35.680]   Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.560]   let him go. You have denied the Holy One and the just. You've killed the Prince of life.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:50.240]   His name, through faith in His name, hath made this man whole, whom ye see and know. Yea,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:57.040]   the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.880]   Isn't this amazing? He didn't preach about the Holy Spirit. Neither did he say the wonderful
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.840]   gift that he'd received and the other apostles. He didn't preach about the Spirit. He didn't
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:14.560]   preach about himself, his experiences. He preached about the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "It's Christ,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.960]   the Son of God, whom you rejected, who's done this." It's always the same. And then go on to
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:28.560]   chapter 4. Peter and John are on trial because of that very miracle. And they are charged. And then
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:38.400]   we are told in verse 8, "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit." What does that mean? Does that
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:45.840]   mean that Peter, who had been filled with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost? No. It means this.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:52.160]   Peter, filled again with the Spirit. You can be filled many times with the Spirit, and we need to
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:46:00.800]   be. Here was a great crisis. And to meet the crisis, the Spirit came upon him again. And he was able to
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:10.480]   speak with this holy boldness in defense of himself and his fellow apostle. And so, you see,
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.240]   it goes on. "And Peter then, filled with the Spirit, said unto them," Well, what did he say?
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:23.200]   "Ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined of the good deed done to
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.080]   the impotent men by what means he has made well, be it known unto you all and to all the people of
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:36.160]   Israel that since we've had the baptism of the Spirit, we've been able to do these marvelous and
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:44.240]   wonderful things, and so..." Not at all. "...be it known unto you that by the name of Jesus Christ
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:52.320]   of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:47:03.920]   here before you well or whole, every time the credit is given in this same way to the Lord
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:10.800]   Jesus Christ. And Peter, filled with the Spirit, invariably," and I can take you on and give you
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:19.760]   other examples, "he always does precisely the same thing." Well, now, my friends, isn't it about time
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:26.880]   that we realize this? That we were scriptural in our attitude to the work of the Spirit and in the
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:33.360]   proofs of the working of the Spirit. There I've given you just some of the biblical evidence.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:41.600]   Now, if you turn to your hymn books, you will find exactly the same thing. You read the hymns,
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:48.720]   some of the greatest hymns in our hymn books, the hymns, if you like, of a man like Charles Wesley.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.200]   "Here was a man who was filled with the Spirit, if ever a man was. He and his brother John and
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.280]   Whitefield and others, they had received a great baptism of power. Thus what made them the flaming
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.200]   evangelists that they became? They were Christians before that, but utterly ineffective. They had gone
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.840]   out to Georgia in America, and they were complete failures. It was after they had this great
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.040]   imbuement of power that they became effective, and Charles began to write his great hymns."
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:27.840]   What is the content of the hymns of Charles Wesley? "This man filled with the Spirit."
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.520]   Have you ever thought about this? You know, I've been doing a bit of research recently.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:40.240]   I've been analyzing the table of contents in our various hymn books. So many are general worship,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:48.160]   general praise of God, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, Scriptures, Church,
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.400]   and so on. Now, if you look up at the numbers, you'll be very interested to find this out.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:59.840]   Speaking generally, you'll find that there are somewhere around about 190 hymns devoted to the
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:08.800]   Lord Jesus Christ, to the Holy Spirit somewhere about 30, or even less than 30. And that is
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:17.520]   absolutely right. And when I say Charles Wesley, can you think at random of a hymn on the Holy
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.760]   Spirit by Charles Wesley? Well, you may remember one or two of you may remember an odd one here or
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.120]   there, but I doubt how many of you would do so. When I say Charles Wesley, do you know what you
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:41.200]   think of? It's this, "Jesus, lover of my soul, thou, O Christ, art all I want. Oh, for a thousand
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:50.480]   tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise." The great hymns of these men filled with the Spirit
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:58.800]   are always hymns to the Lord Jesus Christ and to his glory. It's not surprising. The Spirit is sent
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:05.840]   to glorify him, and he does so through these men with whom he fills himself and this power.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:11.920]   And not only this, if you go through the history of the church in the matter of great preaching,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:19.120]   you will find it's always the same thing. The theme of the great revivals of history
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:28.080]   has always been the person of Christ's atoning death and his glorious resurrection.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:37.360]   My dear friends, we must keep the scriptural balance and realize that always the Spirit
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:46.480]   glorifies and bears witness not to himself, but to the Lord Jesus Christ, his person, and his work.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:52.320]   I feel constrained to tell you a story. Many of you here tonight no doubt remember that saintly,
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:51:00.080]   godly man, William Ngenda, a man who was so prominent, you remember, in the Rwanda revival
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:08.880]   of some years ago. William Ngenda, the African, came over on a visit to this country
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:17.920]   and went around the country preaching in many churches. He and Dr. Joe Church, who again had
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:25.120]   been very prominent in the revival, and they went around the meetings giving an account of the
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:33.520]   marvelous things that had happened in the revival with great acceptance. After a few years,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:42.000]   William Ngenda came over again, paid his second visit to this country, and once more he and Dr.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:51.120]   Joe Church went around the churches speaking. And I happened to meet William Ngenda at the end of
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.360]   this second visit. Indeed, my wife and I had the privilege of entertaining him for the night.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:04.560]   And this is what he said to me. He said, "Do you know, the Christians in this country
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:14.080]   don't want to hear about Jesus." I said, "What do you mean?" Well, he said, "I decided this second
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.640]   time that instead of telling them stories about the revival and marvelous experiences and
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:28.720]   conversions, I would preach to them about Jesus." And he said, "I've done so." But he said, "This
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:36.000]   is what I find. At the close of the service, nice, kind people come to me and they shake me by the
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.120]   hand and they say, 'We're very glad to see you again, Mr. Ngenda, and thank you very much for
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.080]   the word. Thank you very much for the message. But we did hope that you'd have told us a little more
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:55.280]   about the revival.'" "You see," he said, "they don't want to hear about Jesus. They want to hear
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:05.520]   interesting, exciting, thrilling stories about the revival." And he was taken aback by this and
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:11.600]   discouraged by it. I'm afraid there's a great deal of truth in it. I'm afraid there are many people
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:19.120]   among us who are living at the present time on cheap paperbacks, living on the experiences of
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:26.720]   other people. They get very excited and they enjoy reading about these other people. They don't ask
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:33.760]   themselves the question, "Have I ever had this experience? What do I know about this? Is my
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:41.600]   attitude towards the Lord the same?" They're living on other people's experiences. There is a
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:49.680]   grave danger of our being utterly unscriptural in this matter and not giving the glory to the Lord
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:54:00.160]   himself, which the Holy Spirit invariably does. Very well. It is to Him, His person and His work
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:09.760]   that the Holy Spirit, as Peter says, "bears His witness, confirming our witness." And that brings
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:19.200]   me to my last point, which is this. How does the Holy Spirit do this? That's the question.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:27.920]   How does He do this? Well, now I could keep you at great length, even beyond what has been given to
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:36.080]   me in answering this question, but I'm not going to do so because I'm out to emphasize one particular
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:47.360]   thing at this point. How does the Holy Spirit bear this extra witness? So is also the Holy Ghost.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.520]   Now, the danger at this point is, of course, to begin to say about the Holy Spirit's work in us
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:59.760]   and to assume that the Spirit bears His witness in and through us and our ministry. That's all
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:06.640]   right. I'm not saying that doesn't happen. It does happen. But I am arguing that clearly
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:13.760]   that is not what Peter was referring to at this point. He says, "We are His witnesses to these
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:19.520]   things." He was saying, in effect, to the Sanhedrin, "Now, you know all about us. You've
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:26.160]   heard our message. We've told it to ourselves, and you've heard it from others. You know all about
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:37.280]   us. If you're not prepared to listen to us as Peter, listen to the Spirit. He is also a witness."
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:44.480]   That, to me, is the argument at this point. The witness of the Spirit is over and above
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.080]   what He does in and through us. It's over and above His convicting us of sin,
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:57.520]   His leading us to conversion, giving us the new birth, dwelling within us, and working out the
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:03.840]   process of sanctification. If you like, I call that the regular work of the Spirit. And if that
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.280]   is not going on in us, we are not Christians at all. That's not what Peter is referring to.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:18.240]   He is referring here to something objective, something outside us, some phenomenon. He says,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:24.400]   "Look at that. How do you explain that?" He's pointing them to a witness of the Spirit,
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:31.760]   apart from us in a sense, and outside us, and in addition to us, a great phenomenon.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:39.680]   And this is how the Spirit, throughout the centuries, has brought His witness to the Lord
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:50.000]   Jesus Christ. It is what we call "revival." Now, this is a term that we've got to be careful with.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.200]   Our friends in America have the habit of referring to a revival when we would mean
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:06.080]   an evangelistic campaign. They talk about holding a revival, and they prepare for it. Now, that's
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:12.720]   not what I mean by revival at all, and that is not what we mean traditionally in this country
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:18.400]   by revival. This is something new that's come in during the last hundred years. Before that,
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   everybody agreed in the use of revival. What's a revival? I think in many ways,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:34.640]   this is the most crucial question for every one of us as individuals, as members of churches,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:40.240]   as members of this or any other organization, anybody who's engaged in evangelistic work.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:48.000]   What's a revival? I believe it's the greatest need of the hour. I believe it is the only
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:58.240]   solution to our problems. What's a revival? Well, a revival is a falling of the Holy Spirit upon us.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:06.880]   That's the term that is used. If you like, I would say that a revival is a kind of repetition
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:14.240]   of what happened on the day of Pentecost. I've shown you already how Peter and others received
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:21.680]   this several times over. It can happen many, many times to people. It's a falling of the Spirit upon
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:29.680]   us. It's a coming of the Spirit upon us in great power, and it is the most amazing thing. Let me
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:38.320]   give you an illustration or two in order to show you what I mean. Many of you have heard of a great
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.600]   and a saintly man who used to come a lot to this country at the end of the last century, in the
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:51.200]   beginning of this, a man called Andrew Murray, who came from South Africa, a great and a saintly man
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:58.880]   of God. Well, if you can get hold of a copy of his biography, get hold of it and read it, and this is
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:07.120]   what you'll find in it. On one occasion in one of his churches, Andrew Murray had gone to his weekly
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:14.400]   prayer meeting. He wasn't expecting anything to happen. He'd gone, as he'd gone many times before,
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.600]   to the weekly prayer meeting, and he was there sitting at the table presiding over the prayer
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:26.320]   meeting, and the meeting was proceeding. Suddenly, he became aware of a strange noise on one side of
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:31.440]   him, and the noise seemed to be coming nearer and nearer and nearer, and he couldn't make out what
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:39.680]   it was. Suddenly he realized what it was. The Holy Spirit had fallen upon the prayer meeting.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:48.720]   People began to pray with new freedom and with new power. Their tongues were loosed.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:55.120]   A new fervor, a new glow came into the meeting. In other words, a revival had broken out,
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:02.640]   and it continued for many months, and large numbers of people were added to his church
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.000]   and to other churches. That's what I mean by a revival. You see, he had done nothing about it
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.040]   at all, neither had anybody else. He hadn't announced it was going to happen. You can't
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.880]   announce a revival. You never know when it's going to come. It's the sovereign action of the
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:27.040]   God in sending his Holy Spirit. The first thing they knew was that he'd come, and that they were
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:34.080]   lifted up above themselves and out of themselves, and were thrilling with this new power.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:41.440]   Now, my friends, I commend to you the study of the great revivals of history.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:50.560]   Read about revivals in the 18th century, especially as you find them described by a great
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:57.200]   man called Jonathan Edwards, who lived in Massachusetts. There was a great awakening
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:04.080]   there. Read about it, and you'll know what I mean by revival. But it's happened many times.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:11.920]   There was a great revival in the United States in 1857. How did it start? And remember,
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.480]   the result of that revival was that hundreds of thousands were added to the Christian church,
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.800]   and they continued in them. They were not temporary decisions. They had to build new buildings. The
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.920]   statistics are available. The greatest religious movement the United States has probably ever
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:35.680]   known. How did it start? Well, the story is well known. One man of the name of Lamphy
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.800]   began to feel the burden of the spiritual and moral condition of his country, and he began to
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:49.360]   pray at 12 o'clock noon every day, alone. He went on. Others heard of this, and they joined him.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.160]   And eventually the building got too small. They had to move to a bigger, and it became thousands.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.800]   It went through the whole country. The Spirit of God came down. These mighty conversions took place,
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:09.120]   and the church went on to a new glorious period of prosperity. You know, in Northern Ireland,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:17.200]   a year later, 1858, same thing happened. The greatest revival Ireland has ever known.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:25.280]   Do you know how it began? Two farm laborers, ignorant men, again burdened by the state of
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:33.600]   their country, they met together in a tin shed, not even a house or a room, a tin shed in a field,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.080]   and they began to pray to God to visit them and to come in power among them. And after they prayed
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:48.880]   for six months, it began to happen, and it became a mighty revival. I don't remember the Welsh
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.960]   revival, but I had the privilege of knowing many people who were converted in it and during it,
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:01.920]   and many others who had mighty experiences during it. Let me tell you just one story for you to see
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.520]   what I mean by revival. I knew a man. He died about seven or eight years ago. He'd been a
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:14.880]   minister for many years. At the time when the revival broke out in South Wales in 1904, he was
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.400]   a collier, a miner, working underground. He happened to be a musical fellow, and he was very
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.080]   fond of playing a cornet and could do it very well, and he was seriously considering taking
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:32.480]   it up as a profession. So he was having lessons, and he was doing well. And he'd be out having his
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:39.040]   lessons or at practices and sometimes at concerts. Then he'd come home, pleased with himself,
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:47.280]   and want his meal and go to bed. Well, one night he'd been at a concert, and he'd done very well,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.880]   and he got home. The house was in complete darkness, and he wondered what was happening.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:04:00.000]   He went in, no light anywhere, fire going out in the grate, no sign of food. His mother and
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.440]   his sisters were not there. Where were they? He found out that they were down at a revival
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:13.760]   in the chapel to which they belonged, and he was furious. Well, now he just exploded. He completely
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.600]   lost control of himself, and he said he was going down to the chapel to smash up this revival,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.520]   this nonsense, because, you see, people used to go to these meetings at six or seven o'clock in
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.880]   the evening, and they'd go on till three or four o'clock the next morning. So down he went to the
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.680]   chapel, determined to smash it up. When he got there, the place was packed out, literally,
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:42.800]   people cramming the aisles. But he was so determined to do mischief that he squeezed
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:52.400]   himself into the back seat. The next thing he remembered was getting up himself off his knees
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:05:00.560]   immediately beneath the pulpit in the front of the chapel, and he'd been praying, and praying
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.480]   for his father's conversion. He had no idea that he'd left the back seat, but he had,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.720]   and others told him afterwards how he'd done it. He'd walked from the back of one seat to the next,
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:19.120]   until he was in the front. Now, it's all right, you see, this is the power of God.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:27.360]   It's a power of God coming down upon people, and it's supernatural, and it is miraculous.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.920]   And the man's whole life was changed. He did nothing about it. It just happened to him like
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:41.600]   that. This is what I mean by revival, and I am suggesting that this is how the Holy Spirit
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:49.040]   bears his witness to the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm emphasizing this phenomenal aspect,
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:55.840]   this something that happens outside us. You know, there's a great illustration of this
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.720]   in the chapter four of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   When Peter and John had been set free by the Sanhedrin, we are told that being let go,
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.360]   they went back to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:19.440]   unto them. And the people hearing this, they said, "Well, what can we do? They've all got all the
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.880]   power and all the authority. We are nobodies. We are ignorant people. What can we do?" They said,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:31.040]   "There's only one thing to do." And they all, with one accord, lifted up their voice to God.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:39.600]   They prayed God to have mercy upon them. What happened? Well, this is what I read in verse 31.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:48.960]   "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken, where they were assembled together."
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.240]   The place was shaken. Now, that's not witnessed through people, is it?
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:01.440]   It was the building that was shaken. And who shook the building? The Holy Spirit.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.280]   The Holy Spirit was bearing His witness by shaking the building, not through the apostles,
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:16.320]   but through the material building. I know the clever critics would have us believe that what
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.880]   really happened there was this, that these people praying were so frightened that they began to
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:27.920]   shake in fear. No, no. It was the building that shook. The Holy Spirit can shake buildings.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:33.760]   He can shake nations. He can shake any power. He's the power of the living God.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:42.800]   And my friends, this is the only answer to our present position. We must go on bearing our
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:49.600]   witness. Go on with your work. I'll go on with my work. Preach the Word. Present the truth. Give
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:59.040]   the facts. Yes, but if it's to have real effect, we must have the power of the Holy Ghost upon it.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:08.800]   It is essential. And if we forget this, though we may do excellent work, it will scarcely touch
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:16.720]   the problem and the situation by which we are confronted. The greatest need of the hour
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:27.360]   is this witness of the Spirit confirming, attesting, supporting, making use of our
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:36.080]   witness. We are His witnesses of these things. And so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:42.960]   to them that obey Him. I close by one further illustration of what all this means and what I
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:53.120]   mean by revival. If you get a copy of John Wesley's journals, and I commend you to read them,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:09:02.000]   most instructive in these matters. And if you turn up John Wesley's journal for January the 1st,
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:14.960]   1739, this is what you'll read. He says there that the night before, he and some 60 people
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:22.240]   had met together for a kind of watch-night service, a love feast and a time of fellowship together
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.640]   in Fetter Lane here in London. It was a very interesting company. George Whitfield was there,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.000]   John and Charles Wesley, and all other prominent men, the Moravians and others,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.960]   who were notable at that time in the work of the Kingdom of God. And they'd met together,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:45.040]   as he says, in this way, to have a meal together and to pray together, to sing together and to
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:52.880]   talk together. And this is what he says. "About three o'clock in the morning,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:04.240]   the power of God suddenly descended upon us." He says, "Some fell to the ground.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:16.000]   Others gave praises unto God." And then he goes on to say that after we had recovered a little
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:26.960]   from our awe at the presence of his majesty, we broke out together in one accord.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:34.400]   We praised thee, O God. We acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:45.920]   Now, John Wesley, as you all probably know, was a most unemotional man. He was almost a pedantic
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:52.560]   man. He'd been a fellow of his college at Oxford, not an excitable Celt like some of us, but a
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   typical, stolid, solid, common-sense Englishman. Not emotional, quiet, calm. He is the man who
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:09.360]   talks about that. The power of God falling upon us, people falling to the ground, people crying
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:18.880]   out, praising God. John Wesley, of course, that's revival. That's the Spirit of God coming down.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.520]   There's no revival in this country today. People are talking about renewal. All right, it is
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.880]   renewal. That's something you can do. They say, "Realize what you've got and yield yourself to it."
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:35.600]   Right, I agree. That's renewal. But that is not revival. In revival, you and I can do nothing
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:45.600]   except to cry for it. It is God who sends it. And he sends it in his own time and in his own way.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:52.640]   And what's the effect of his coming? It is to humble people. When the Spirit comes upon people,
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   they're not glib and superficial and light and always talking about themselves. No, no.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:07.360]   There's an awe, as John Wesley describes it, there is an awe at the presence of his majesty.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:15.440]   Have you ever felt the presence of the living God? I'm not asking whether you believe the message.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:23.760]   I'm asking, have you felt the touch of his power? This is our greatest need.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:33.600]   When a revival comes, more can happen in one day than in 50 days of our work without him.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.200]   It's often happened. Jonathan Edwards used to say that God had kept his church going
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.320]   throughout the centuries by means of revivals. And there's a great deal to be said for that.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:51.040]   But certainly, our greatest need today is this. We are Orthodox. Thank God. I wouldn't be here
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.360]   but for that. I know your reputation. I thank God for you. You're men of God. You're men of the Word.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.760]   Right. And I'm with you. And we've been trying to preach and to propagate this message for years.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:11.040]   We must go on doing so. But we must never forget to pray for this almighty power,
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:19.520]   for this descent of the Spirit upon us and upon others. For when he comes,
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:26.960]   the whole situation is transformed. That 18th century awakening changed the whole face of
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:35.200]   this country. And this is what God has done throughout the centuries. It is not Orthodoxy
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:46.400]   alone. It is not the Spirit alone. It is the Spirit of God upon the Word of God by which we
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:54.560]   test and prove every spirit. For there are evil spirits and we must not surrender ourselves
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:01.920]   thoughtlessly to any power. We must make sure that it is the power of God and the Spirit of God
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:11.600]   and not some other spirit. But here we have it. We have the Word. Let us pray that the power of
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:19.680]   the Spirit may come upon it and upon us so that we may witness with this holy apostolic boldness
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:28.880]   and we shall see large numbers of people in many lands translated from the kingdom of Satan
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:39.120]   into the kingdom of God's dear Son and from darkness to light. May God bless you in all
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.560]   your efforts and may he keep us all to the balance of the Scripture, not either or,
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   the both end of the Spirit and the Word. Let us pray.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:03.600]   O Lord our God, we thank thee more than ever that thou hast been pleased to give us thy holy Word.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:12.800]   We realize what frail, fallible creatures we are and how prone we are to go off on tangents
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:22.720]   and to trust to our own understanding only. We thank thee that thou hast given us thy Spirit
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.960]   and thou hast given us thy Word. O God, we cry out unto thee as a company of thy people
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:41.520]   to have mercy upon us, God of our fathers. Let it be known that thou art still God in Israel.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:51.680]   Let it be known in this arrogant twentieth century that thou art the same God who has acted
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:16:00.960]   and operated throughout the running centuries. Honor thine own Word, O Lord. Honor thine own
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:12.240]   dear Son. Exalt his precious name and bring many to a knowledge of him as their only Savior and
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:24.960]   their Lord. Lord, have pity upon us in the midst of wrath. Remember mercy. Revive thy work, O Lord,
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:35.680]   thy mighty arm make bare. Speak with a voice that wakes the dead and make the people hear.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
