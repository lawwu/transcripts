[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about the contentious debate over
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.140]   limited atonement by asking the question, "For whom did Christ die for? What is
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.480]   the extent of his atoning work? Did he die for the elect only or did he die for
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.440]   every human who would ever live? In other words, was the atoning death of Christ
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.240]   limited or was it unlimited?" So we have this question from Vincent in Japan.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.400]   Hello Pastor John. As you know, Calvinists/Reformed theologians major on
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.320]   the theme of God's glory. So my question is, "How does limited atonement make much
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.920]   of the majesty of Jesus when it is called limited? I understand that we
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360]   sinned against an infinitely holy God and therefore need an infinite atoning
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   sacrifice. How is this reconciled with the doctrine of limited atonement? Isn't
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.280]   an unlimited atonement more profoundly glorious?" Well let's start with a
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.320]   celebration of an amazing book published three years ago called "From Heaven He
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.480]   Came and Sought Her, Definite Atonement in Historical, Biblical, Theological, and
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:19.400]   Pastoral Perspective." 23 essays all answering that question. So I would hope
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.560]   that our questioner would go and find the book. So Vincent, look it up.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.040]   It is really worth the effort. So you can see what the editors of that book did.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680]   They did not use the word "limited atonement." They used the word, the phrase,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.200]   "definite atonement," not "limited," because Vincent is right that on the face of it,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.520]   limited atonement sounds like God is held back, limited in some way from doing
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.760]   the really great thing. But in fact, both sides in this debate limit the atonement
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.640]   only in different ways. And the question is, when they're both said and done, is
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.960]   the definite atonement a more glorious act than the one supported by unlimited
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   atonement? So let's start with a definition of atonement. I don't assume
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.480]   that everybody knows even that word. The atonement is the work of God in Christ
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.080]   through Christ's obedience and death and resurrection by which he canceled the
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:42.240]   debt of our sin, removed or absorbed the holy wrath of God against us, and secured
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.360]   for us all the benefits of salvation, even eternal life. That's the atonement,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.640]   the work of God in Christ to achieve all of that. So the atonement is the work of
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   God to deal with our sin, to deal with his wrath through the work of Christ so
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.320]   that we could have eternal life. Now, both sides limit this action. Let me see if I
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.960]   can explain. Those who espouse definite atonement affirm all of this, namely that
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.840]   the death of Christ did effectively secure the complete eternal salvation of
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.480]   God's elect, the bride of Christ, including the fulfillment of the
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   promises of the new covenant to take out of his chosen people, each one of them,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.280]   the heart of stone, and put in a new believing heart and cause us to walk in
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.760]   his statutes. The blood of Jesus, the atonement, secured that absolutely,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.400]   effectively, perfectly for all of God's elect. Now let me try to explain this
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.360]   with some texts. Luke 22 20, it says that Christ took the cup, this is at the Lord's
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   Supper, after they had eaten, saying, "This cup poured out for you is the new
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   covenant in my blood." Matthew 26 28 says, "This is my blood of the covenant which
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.800]   is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." In other words,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.160]   right at the heart of the atonement, the shedding of the blood of Jesus, is God's
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.840]   design to purchase, secure, obtain what was promised in the new covenant. That's
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.240]   what it means when it says, "This blood of mine is the new covenant." Jeremiah 31
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.240]   and 32, Ezekiel 19, Ezekiel 36, Deuteronomy 6, he's purchasing and
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.360]   obtaining and securing absolutely, infallibly, the promises of the new
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.680]   covenant for his people. Well, what was promised in the new covenant? It was not
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.960]   just an offer of salvation for those who would produce faith on their own, but
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.880]   rather, the very gift of faith was purchased. The transformation that made
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.000]   faith a reality was secured in the atonement for the beneficiaries of the
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.200]   new covenant. In other words, a new heart was purchased for God's people in the
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   atonement. This is more than the purchase of a possibility. This is more than the
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.680]   purchase of an offer of salvation. This is the real purchase for God's people of
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   God's sovereign work to take out the heart of stone and put in the new
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.720]   believing heart of flesh. Nobody would believe if that hadn't been bought for
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.880]   them. Here's the way it's said in Ezekiel 36, 26, "I will give you a new heart, a new
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.400]   spirit I will put within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.240]   flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you and cause
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:21.280]   you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances." This
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.400]   is one of the ways that the new covenant is greater than the old covenant. God
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.640]   works decisively and sovereignly to fulfill the promises of the new heart,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.840]   new obedience in the lives of his people. He doesn't leave it to so-called free
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:48.200]   will. He overcomes the bondage of the will to sin, gives us the gift of faith,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.000]   puts in a new heart, grants repentance, causes us to walk in his ways. This is
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.880]   therefore a definite, decisive, particular achievement of the cross for the people
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:11.760]   of God, the elect, the bride of Christ. If this were done for everybody, everybody
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.680]   would be saved because it's effectual. But we know from Scripture everyone is
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:27.040]   not saved. So if you ask me, "Well, did Christ die for everyone?" The answer is
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:34.760]   Christ died for everyone but not everyone in the same way. He died for
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:43.920]   everyone without distinction in John 3.16. In that sense, "For God so loved the
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.440]   world that he gave his only Son." Well, in what sense? "For the world so that
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.000]   whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." It's
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.400]   because of the atonement that that's possible. You can say that to everybody.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:08.960]   In other words, God gave his Son for the world in such a way that whoever believes
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.080]   in him would have eternal life. That is, in such a way that the offer can be made
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.400]   to everybody in every people group, in every family, in every neighborhood can
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.080]   be made without any distinction or without any hesitation. If you believe on
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:34.000]   Jesus you will have eternal life. And the reason this is so is that Christ
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.240]   purchased a full and complete and effective and eternal infallible
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:48.320]   salvation for the Bride of Christ and everyone who believes is part of that
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.600]   Bride. This is what we offer people when we do evangelism, which we should do
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:04.800]   every day. We say, "There is a complete and full and effective redemption for the
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.360]   people of God. It is already secured, already full, already complete. We invite
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:17.720]   you to receive Christ and with him you receive everything that he bought for
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.920]   his people." So we're offering Christ to people and the full complete salvation
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.520]   that he bought for his people, for those who are in him. But this means that
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.760]   Christ died for his Bride and he loves his people in a particular and definite
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.960]   way that's different from all the world, just like I love my wife different from
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.760]   all the women that I love in another way. So in answer to Vincent's question, "Isn't
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.560]   an unlimited atonement more profoundly glorious?" The answer is no, because that
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.800]   so-called unlimited atonement, if it existed, which it doesn't, would leave
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.240]   everybody in bondage to sin because no triumphant grace that takes out the
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.160]   heart of sin and stone and purchases redemption and a new heart, none of that
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.460]   would be provided. And the decisive act of faith that saves us wouldn't be a
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:28.960]   gift bought by the blood of Jesus. Nobody would be grafted into the vine because
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.220]   that only happens because they were purchased by the blood according to the
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:42.100]   new covenant. On the other hand, definite atonement is glorious because it
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:49.840]   accomplishes more, not less, which is why the claim that unlimited is more than
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:58.480]   limited. No, definite atonement is more glorious because it accomplishes more,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:06.040]   not less, than the so-called unlimited atonement. It not only purchases a
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   genuine offer to the whole world in terms of John 3:16, but goes beyond the
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.840]   offer and actually accomplishes the triumph over unbelief and hardness of
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:27.560]   heart and brings to pass salvation and all the purposes of God that depend on
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.960]   it. Yeah, these are huge realities at stake here, it's such an important
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.120]   conversation and it takes time to sink in. Pastor John, thank you for addressing
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.480]   it here. If this is the first time you've ever heard the phrases "definite atonement"
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.000]   or "unlimited atonement" and your head is swimming, most of this probably doesn't
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.360]   make a lot of sense yet. If that's you, I want to encourage you to stay with it.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's worth thinking through these things because it's not just some pointless
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   debate between theological eggheads. We believe it is a means of seeing the
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.480]   magnificent glory of Jesus Christ with greater clarity. So re-listen to this
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.160]   episode two or three times and then consider getting the book. Again, it's
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.560]   called "From Heaven He Came and Sought Her." It's a thick, serious book, but go there
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.600]   and at least read Pastor John's chapter first, it's near the end of the book. You
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.320]   can get it from Amazon and from wherever quality books on the atonement are sold.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:20.240]   I'm your host Tony Ranke, thanks for listening. We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
