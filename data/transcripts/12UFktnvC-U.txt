[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   What are some of the mistakes people make trying to save money using gift cards?
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.700]   And how can we help people avoid those mistakes?
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.460]   I would say if you're not getting like a major purchase, like an appliance,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.660]   you should also consider that if you put it on a credit card,
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.000]   your card may or may not have some kind of extended warranty protection.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300]   So you need to weigh the value of the discount
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.700]   that you're getting on the gift cards versus what you might be giving up
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.700]   if you value that warranty or if you value those other things.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.300]   Another thing that that is a tradeoff is if you're buying these gift cards
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.300]   to make a purchase that you might return.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.600]   So clothing comes to mind.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.940]   It can be very annoying if you go back and return those.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.200]   They're not going to give you cash for your return.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   Generally, they're going to give you gift cards.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.800]   If you're the type of person who buys everything in three sizes
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.940]   and you have it shipped to your house and you try it on
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.160]   and you send back the ones you don't want, then gift cards could be a bigger mess
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.740]   than it's worth, because you're going to end up with a bunch of gift cards
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.240]   and weird denominations, and you may lose them over the course of like
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.300]   however long until you shop at that store again.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.500]   There are definitely tradeoffs.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.940]   And you should make sure that the the value that you're getting
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.060]   from the discount is worth those tradeoffs.
