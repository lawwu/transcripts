[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Well, how do I know if I am completely surrendered to Christ?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.960]   It's a question today from a listener named Maria, who listens to the podcast from the
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   Netherlands.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   Dear Pastor John, thank you so much for this wonderful podcast.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.840]   I'd like to respond to APJ 1459, which is titled, "I'm Afraid of Surrendering to Christ.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.840]   What Can I Do?"
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.440]   And I want to respond by posing a follow-up question to it.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.280]   How do I know if I'm surrendered to Christ completely?
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.540]   I grew up in a Christian home, studied at a Christian college, got married, worked for
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240]   a Christian organization.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.320]   From the outside, that looks good.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.100]   From the inside, I wonder, how do you know that you surrendered everything?
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.040]   Is it, for example, a mindset of the heart, which relates to making good choices?
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.520]   Is it listening to a sermon instead of watching a TV show?
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.900]   Is it reading a Christian book instead of non-Christian fiction?
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.120]   Or is it more related to big things, as becoming a missionary and doing lots of volunteer work?
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.280]   How do I know if my life is completely surrendered to Christ?
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.240]   I pray throughout the day, but I often feel caught up in earthly chores that I see no
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.240]   eternal value in.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   Pastor John, what would you say to Maria?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   Let's start by affirming the goal that Maria expresses, namely, to be totally surrendered
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.240]   to Christ, nothing held back.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.320]   Now, I know, and perhaps Maria knows, that the language of surrender is not explicitly
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.880]   found in the New Testament, but the reality is there.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.400]   The picture of surrender is that once we were enemies and our lives were at odds with God,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.860]   we did not submit to Him, we were not surrendered to Him, we were our own masters doing our
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.200]   own will, robbing God of not only everything He's given to us, but our souls as well,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.540]   and then a miracle happens, and we're born again, and everything turns around.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.860]   We don't want to withhold anything from God anymore.
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.960]   We are eager to be totally at His disposal, do anything He wants, at any cost.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.360]   We want to do it in the power that He supplies, so that in everything He gets the glory.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.300]   That's what it means to be saved from the old way.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.600]   So the reality of surrender is there, even if the language is not.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.800]   Here's some ways that the Bible talks about what Maria means by, and what we would all,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.360]   I think, mean by total or full surrender to Christ.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.580]   Luke 14.33, "Any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.080]   Or Matthew 10.37, "Whoever loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.720]   and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   Or Matthew 22.37, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.280]   your soul, and with all your mind."
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   Or Philippians 3.7, "Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.480]   Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   Jesus my Lord.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:38.040]   For His sake, I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish in order
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.480]   that I may gain Christ."
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:50.520]   That's what Maria wants, and she wants to know how she can know if she's doing it.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.820]   She wants to know, "How can I know if I'm fully surrendered, if I'm fully loving God
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.720]   with all my heart, if I've renounced everything for Him?"
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   I want to love nothing more than I love Jesus.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.400]   I want to love God with not just a part of my heart, but all of my heart.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   I want to treasure Jesus more than everything in the world.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:30.160]   How can she know if her heart has arrived at this kind of full surrender, full allegiance,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.800]   full affection?
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   Now, I have to say something very sobering, even before I make some suggestions about
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.440]   how to move towards the enjoyment of this assurance that you are surrendered.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:56.720]   None of us—this is very sobering, let it sink in—none of us will ever get to a point
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:05.140]   in our Christian maturity where it is not possible, theoretically, to doubt the authenticity
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.140]   of our surrender.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:15.760]   In other words, it is theoretically possible, no matter what you say or what you do, to
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:23.160]   think you might be a fake, you might not be totally surrendered, no matter what you have
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   done.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Think of it.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.520]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 3, "If I give away all I have and if I deliver my body to be
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.560]   burned, but have not love, I gain nothing."
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.640]   Wow.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:46.840]   So if you can actually—not just theoretically, but actually—give your life and yet not
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.760]   be really loving, not fully surrendered to love, then how easy it is to imagine that
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   dozens of behaviors less than the ultimate sacrifice will not give you a sense of assurance
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.620]   that you have surrendered all.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.760]   Is it not shocking—it is to me, oh my goodness, this is shocking—to realize that John Piper
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:24.600]   could actually have the courage to be burned at the stake, and in those last horrible moments
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.520]   with the flames licking in pain at my skin, to have the thought enter my mind, "You're
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.280]   not real, Piper.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.480]   You're not really surrendered.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.000]   You're not a real Christian.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You just want to be remembered as famous.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   You're just a fake.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.560]   You're just trying to earn your salvation."
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.480]   That's a scary thought.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.800]   Or as I said, sobering.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.720]   We never get beyond the theoretical possibility of doubting our full surrender.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.760]   You can always say, "Maybe I'm deluding myself.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.120]   Maybe I'm deluding myself."
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   So what do we do?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:21.760]   Live in perpetual doubt and fear of failing in the very thing Jesus requires of us?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.120]   or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.480]   It's not optional.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.000]   Have we surrendered the love of father and mother?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.040]   Have we surrendered the love of son and daughter to the extent that Jesus is loved supremely?
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.520]   What do we do?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.760]   It's clear to me, really clear, that the New Testament does not want us to live in such
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   fear.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.840]   It doesn't want us to lay down our head every night and say, "Well, I have no idea whether
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.240]   I was real today or not."
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.680]   I would say three things.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.960]   Number one, say to Jesus—so I'm just basically giving you how I fight this battle, as I say
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.040]   it laid out in Scripture, three steps.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:19.880]   One, say to Jesus, and mean it with as much truthfulness as you can, "I love you, Jesus.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.280]   I love you more than I love anyone."
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   Say it.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   Say it out loud.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.480]   Around people or not around people?
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   Say it out loud.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   "I surrender all other loves as subordinate to you, and I ask that if there is any self-deceit
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   in my saying this, you would take it away, at any cost take it away, and cause me to
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.760]   speak truly and authentically."
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   I say things like that to the Lord regularly.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:09:01.920]   I express my love to him, my allegiance to him, my trust, and then very honestly, I admit
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.980]   to him that my heart is deceitful.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:15.080]   There are hidden faults, and would he please kill in me all that is contrary to my confession
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.800]   of my surrender and make me pure and truthful?
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:29.400]   And you may be surprised how the verbal, out loud declaration of your full surrender and
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:37.040]   full allegiance and full trust intensifies the very thing you are affirming.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.280]   That's number one.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.160]   Say it out loud and ask God to kill everything in you contrary to what you're saying.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.080]   Number two, I would say, act.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:55.560]   So the first one was say, and the second one is act on some godly inclinations that he
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:03.680]   gives you, which might stretch your competency or confidence so that you have to throw yourself
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.720]   on his mercy and power to help you more than if you didn't do the act.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:20.920]   And say to him in the doing of it that you are not trying to negotiate or earn anything.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:30.640]   And ask him to give you the power and the love to do it in the name of Jesus authentically
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.520]   so that he gets the glory.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.000]   And you may be surprised that in the actual doing of acts of surrender with that kind
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.400]   of prayer, the reality of the surrender becomes more authentic.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.880]   And finally, number three, this is the ultimate bottom line.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.160]   Since the confidence that you are acting in full surrender can always be doubted, theoretically
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:09.760]   can always be doubted, ask your heavenly Father that he would work the miracle of Romans 8:16
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.720]   in your life, that he would take away the doubt.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.640]   Just take it away.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   You can't make it go away.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.160]   The more you focus on telling it to go away, the more you think about it.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.120]   It's like, I will not think about white elephants.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.940]   I will not think about white elephants.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.720]   Anything you do can make it go away, but he can take it away.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:38.320]   The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.280]   So number one, speak the truth of full surrender.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.100]   Number two, act the truth of full surrender.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.760]   Number three, pray for the gift of assurance of full surrender.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the great question, Maria from the Netherlands.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.200]   I know we have listeners outside of the States, and we are really grateful to God for all
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.760]   of you international listeners.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.160]   Well if a wife is more spiritually mature than her husband, how does the husband lead
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.020]   her spiritually?
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.880]   It's not an uncommon situation.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.560]   It's not an uncommon question.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   And it's in the inbox.
