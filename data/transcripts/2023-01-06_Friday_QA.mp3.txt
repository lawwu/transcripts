[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.540]   But we'll save that for a separate show.

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.860]   Works just like Call & Talk Radio.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.260]   I publish a phone number and a call in time,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.960]   and then listeners of the show call in and we chat.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.400]   I don't screen the phone calls.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940]   Right now we've got one, two, three, four people on the line.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.400]   Usually we get somewhere between six and 12 callers call in,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.700]   and we talk about anything that you want.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.080]   Think of this as open line Friday.

[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.860]   and it allows us to create useful

[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.300]   the way that you do that is by becoming a patron.

[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   - Hi there, Joshua.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   So I recently transitioned from an office job
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.680]   and I got back into blue collar work.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.940]   And my main purpose is I want to use this
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.240]   to build my own business,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   and I'm just building some skills right now.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   So I was wondering if you had any thoughts
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.800]   on how to start a business part-time
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.080]   so that I can try to replace this main income
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.880]   that I'm learning from right now.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.180]   - What kind of blue collar work are you doing?
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.800]   - Right now I'm in a kind of a maintenance role
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.680]   over a park, it's actually a zoo.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.080]   So I get exposure to a lot of things,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   but I'm trying to use it to get a lot of skills
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.480]   in construction and landscape.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   - Describe to me the business
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.100]   that you are interested in starting.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.960]   - The business that I'm interested in starting
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   would be a niche section of landscaping
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.700]   and maybe lawn care.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.540]   Getting into natives, edible landscaping,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.960]   water features, and basically a green living style approach
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.840]   to landscape design.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   - Okay, and how long have you been doing
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.000]   the maintenance work at the zoo?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.720]   - At the zoo, only a couple months.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.120]   I've got a background in construction and landscaping.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.520]   - Okay, well I guess what I would start with
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.560]   as far as kind of good general advice is quite simply this.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.040]   The day you find your first customer,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520]   that's the day you're in business.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   And in general, with what you're describing
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.480]   of niche landscaping, lawn care,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.640]   or kind of property development,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.800]   this is not something that requires you
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.120]   to have 30 years of experience.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.240]   Now, you will want to have some specialized knowledge
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.560]   about what local plants will work best,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.920]   what would be kind of the most,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.160]   again, the best kinds of plants for the environment.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.260]   But this is several weeks of study.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.300]   This is not years of study.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.680]   This is weeks or perhaps months of study and design.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.560]   And most of your energy and focus
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.640]   should simply be in acquiring your first customer.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.160]   In this type of business, your only limitation
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.700]   is the number of customers that you can find and attract.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.220]   You can work a job during the week
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.440]   or whatever hours you're there,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.320]   and then you can do this kind of job on the weekends
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.400]   and at night or early in the morning
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.560]   or whatever works with your other hours.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.680]   The limiting factor is simply your finding customers.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.160]   And your customers really care only about
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.400]   what you sell them as far as the vision.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.200]   They're gonna have input into that,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   and then your ability to follow through on the vision.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.340]   So my overall advice would be,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.440]   make your transition plan as short as possible,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.440]   and focus heavily on finding high-quality customers.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   Because the day you find your first customer,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.800]   that's the day that you're in business.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.720]   You don't need anything more than that.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.360]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   Awesome advice.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.720]   Do you mind if I ask you another thing
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   specific to the job I have now?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.760]   - Sure.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   - I started recently being at the zoo.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.920]   It's actually a city position.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.560]   And they do offer a pension plan that's after five years.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.160]   Do you have any advice on calculating
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.600]   how much that would be worth
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   to jump into my own business full-time?
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   If it's worth it to stay the five years
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.320]   or to branch out on my own once I start getting customers?
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.360]   - What is your current salary at the zoo?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.920]   - The current salary is about $42,000 a year.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.520]   - Yeah, so it's almost certainly
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.740]   that this should be maximum a six-month deal for you.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.480]   Much quicker than six months,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.880]   you should be out on your own.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.000]   And so there's no point in participating in the pension.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   There's no point in kind of working towards that.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.180]   Now, let me explain, just so you understand very clearly
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.720]   why I'm saying what I'm saying.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.800]   You said to me, "I took a job as a bridge
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.560]   "so that I can start my own business."
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.960]   And then you described the business
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   that you are planning to start.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.780]   If you said to me, "I took the job
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.560]   "and I'm planning to do this job for a long time,"
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   well, of course, participate in the pension plan.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.480]   But you're taking this job to learn some skills
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   and to give yourself some income
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.520]   while you're starting a business.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.080]   And my point is, there's never gonna be a better time
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.320]   to start a business.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.480]   And maybe you'll vest five years from now, but so what?
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.520]   Just because you vest,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.320]   still is not gonna make a meaningful difference
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.600]   in your income.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.480]   So you should be able in 12 months or less,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.320]   you should certainly be able to replace
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.680]   a 40-something thousand dollar salary.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.920]   And you should certainly be able to double that next year.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.720]   And you should certainly be able to double it again
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.040]   in year three.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.120]   And so this is just not that,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.480]   I don't think this is in any way out of reach.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.040]   What kind of price range are you imagining?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   Describe to me a job that you might do for a potential client
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.220]   and how much you're gonna bill that client
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.520]   for that kind of job.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.560]   - So it would be totally dependent.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.240]   I think I would start just to start building a portfolio.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.280]   It would be kind of a front yard installs,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.160]   lawn replacements, raised bed gardens,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.640]   so small carpentry.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   So a lot of those jobs on the material side
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   it would probably be between one to $5,000 in costs.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.520]   And then it depends on the size for my labor
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.840]   and if I end up getting anyone else onto the business.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.560]   And then a 20% markup seems to be
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.280]   about what I'm looking at there.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   So it's just filling up with enough market demand.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.920]   I haven't done enough research on that area,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.080]   specifically being in the area that I am.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   I'm not sure how many compared to big cities,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   how necessary all the green living style
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.720]   landscape design is.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.160]   - Okay, so I don't wanna get too deep
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   into the specifics here,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.000]   but I think you're dramatically underestimating
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.720]   the kinds of jobs that you could do fairly quickly.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.880]   I mean, I can't imagine somebody hiring you
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.440]   for a $1,000 job.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   And you gotta understand that the kinds of people
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440]   who are gonna hire you for your services
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.040]   are the kinds of people who don't wanna do their own work.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.120]   Any kind of Joe homeowner that wants to put in
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.680]   some raised beds and spend $1,000,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.680]   he's very likely to go do it himself
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.520]   or hire a couple of buddies to help him
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.840]   or just 12 pack of beer and do it on the weekends.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.280]   $1,000 expenditure on a front yard is nothing.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   And so I think you're dramatically underestimating
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.240]   the size of the jobs that you should be looking for.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   I'm guessing, and again, to be clear,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.840]   I have no personal experience in this kind of business.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.520]   This is just a generalized perspective
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.920]   from a little bit of life experience
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.840]   and thinking about some of this stuff.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.160]   But your minimum job that you would bid should be $5,000.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.120]   And you should very much not be working from a,
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.080]   okay, what, the percentage of markup basis.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   You should go in and do your best to present plans,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.640]   present ideas, present clear proposals,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.840]   and then bid them on a job cost basis.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.200]   Now, clearly you're not yet a landscape designer
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.280]   who's going to have the fullness of that.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.640]   But I think that you're basically,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.560]   your minimum job size, what I'm saying, should be $5,000.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.960]   I don't think building a business on $1,000 jobs,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.280]   unless you somehow have a lot of them
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.200]   and you have a clear markup for that,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.160]   is in any way sustainable.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.800]   So think about what is a $5,000 job look like?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   What does a $5,000 job entail?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.760]   What's the material cost, et cetera?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.560]   And then focus on getting yourself into a situation
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.240]   where you can do one of those every weekend.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.440]   Because if you're building out a $5,000 job,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.160]   let's say that you have, say, $2,000 of profit in that,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.000]   then if you could do those one every other weekend
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.880]   or two weekends per job,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   then pretty quickly you can replace your income.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.840]   But you need to get to the point
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.440]   where you understand what it's like to sell those jobs,
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.240]   and then you need to deliver some
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.080]   so that you can build that portfolio.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.800]   You might, I'm generally pretty skeptical
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.440]   of the idea of doing work to build a portfolio
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.320]   that doesn't pay well.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.680]   You might have to sell a little harder.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.800]   You might lose a few clients
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.680]   while you're getting to that first job,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.640]   but I don't see why you shouldn't be paid well
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.720]   for your first job, or at least paid adequately.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.080]   Maybe not paid handsomely,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.040]   but paid adequately for the first job,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.000]   and then boom, take lots of pictures and get going.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.480]   But it sounds to me like you're a little short
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.120]   in terms of the kinds of things
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.760]   that you're imagining doing.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.280]   Otherwise, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.240]   And so you need to go and talk to people in that business,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.400]   develop some relationships with people.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   At the very least, I would hire myself on as a day laborer,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.880]   at least on the weekend around my other job
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.440]   for someone else.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.400]   Guys who do what you do are always looking
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   for somebody who's willing to do side work for them.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   Working for them on the weekend
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.680]   might work really beautifully for their needs,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.640]   'cause maybe they have crews that work during the week,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.480]   but they could use a little bit more weekend help.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.640]   So building some contacts and getting around it.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.600]   But I think your numbers are too small.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.880]   Think about what a $5,000 job would look like.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.160]   How would you deliver on that?
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.960]   How would you build $1,500 to $2,000 a profit
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.120]   into a $5,000 job, and then develop a few of those?
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.960]   And if you're gonna do portfolio work,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.000]   go to your mom's house and do it for her.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.320]   And then really make sure you max,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.400]   or do it in your own yard, maximize your pictures.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   But you don't need to give your services away
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   to paying customers.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.280]   That's the whole point of having a day job
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.740]   that provides you with income,
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.940]   is it allows you to just to be patient
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.300]   and go for actual good and real customers.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.640]   So on the weekend, you're not doing work for free.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.440]   Either you're going out looking for customers
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.360]   and showing them the portfolio that you've created
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.780]   in your yard, in your mom's yard, et cetera,
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.480]   or you're at the library studying the books,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.260]   or you're volunteering and/or working for
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.040]   a landscape designer, someone else.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.640]   You're becoming, you're going to the local,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.920]   every, you're giving tours at a local botanical garden
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.480]   for local native species.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.440]   You're setting up a wildscaping tour of town
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.760]   so that you really know your stuff,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.720]   and you can make those contacts
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   in kind of the native species world.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.360]   But I guess my point is, don't,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.220]   you're not gonna make a living on $1,000 jobs.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.000]   I mean, so raise your sights,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.240]   and then build your skills in accordance with it.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080]   Fair enough?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   - That sounds good, thank you.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.680]   Yeah, I think that my problem is,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.320]   I'm approaching it from like a handyman style,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.020]   you know, ones and two, odd-in jobs.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.160]   I should be really looking at
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.760]   more of a contracting company style
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.680]   of getting large jobs to get the profits in.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.160]   And I'm hoping, I've learned a lot.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.520]   There's a summit coming up,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.340]   where they're having a big gathering
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.260]   for a lot of already in-progress businesses.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.540]   So hopefully I can learn a lot from that
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.420]   in the next couple of weeks.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.660]   - Yeah, that sounds wonderful.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.900]   I guess the key thing is just,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.860]   narrow down on who your customer is.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.160]   And your customer is not you, right?
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.220]   The guy who hires a handyman is not the guy,
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.460]   the guy who does work on his house on the weekends
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.940]   doesn't hire a handyman.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.300]   The guy who hires a handyman
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.980]   is who has more money than time,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.460]   and wants a good quality result,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.980]   and is willing to pay for it.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.780]   So you may not have a lot of experience personally
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.640]   being the kind of guy who hires the handyman.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.140]   But recognize that when people hire a handyman,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.380]   or when people hire someone,
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.420]   what they want is quality work.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.780]   And they want a fair price,
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.100]   but they're not looking for a cheap price.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.660]   All right, and this has been a transition
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.620]   that I've made in my own life.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.300]   I grew up, my parents didn't,
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.860]   we didn't have a lot of money growing up.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.800]   I was normal middle class,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.620]   but we didn't have a lot of money.
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.460]   And my dad did a lot of his own work,
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.460]   and I grew up working with him on stuff.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.100]   And so I was very much in the DIY mentality.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.380]   And as I got older,
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.500]   and as I started to have more money,
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.940]   I realized I don't wanna DIY this stuff anymore.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.140]   I don't enjoy it, I don't wanna do it, I don't like it.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.380]   And so I want to hire it done.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.140]   And so I, over the years,
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.180]   have hired more people to do stuff.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.100]   Now, and I do have a budget.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.140]   So there are times in which I don't do things
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.460]   because I just don't feel like that's worth it.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.380]   But when it's worth it for me to hire somebody,
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.580]   I'm not looking for the cheapest price.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.180]   I'm looking for the guy who's the most reliable.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.020]   I'm looking for the guy who's gonna follow through
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.560]   and do what he says he's gonna do.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.660]   I'm looking for the guy that can provide the insight
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.780]   and the expertise that I don't have.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.280]   I'm looking for a guy that's gonna make sure
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.400]   the job site is totally clean at the end of the day.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   I'm looking for a guy who's gonna be trustworthy.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.500]   Those are skills that you already have,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.280]   or I hope you have, or if not, fix them, right?
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.260]   Show up on time, do what you say you're gonna do,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.860]   and clean up before you leave.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.220]   In the United States, you can make multiple
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.980]   six figures a year if you just show up on time,
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.180]   do what you agree to do, and clean up before you leave
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.280]   at the end of the day.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.300]   Because the other skills are relatively quickly earned.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   So don't think that you're selling to the people who,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.260]   you know, again, are gonna do a $1,000 job.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.080]   You're not.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.780]   You're selling to people who are willing to spend more money
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.700]   and what they're looking for is good advice
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.080]   and good service.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.240]   We go to Ben in Tennessee.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.080]   Ben, welcome to the show.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.920]   How can I serve you today?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.580]   - Hey, good afternoon.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.840]   First time calling, so I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.540]   I guess I have a question.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.620]   Maybe it's a prioritization question.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.060]   So I've got a few things on my plate
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.780]   that I know you've discussed in the past.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.500]   So my wife and I are both working.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.600]   She works part-time.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.720]   And we total make about $250,000 a year.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.640]   And we have two little girls.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.920]   One of them is three, coming up on school age,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.880]   and we're thinking about homeschooling.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.460]   We also recently purchased a vacation property
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.120]   that we really like, but now we're wondering
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.520]   if maybe it's too much of an anchor financially.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:37.960]   What I'm considering doing is somehow,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.480]   you know, reducing our income
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.440]   to try to make homeschooling more doable
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.920]   for us from a time standpoint,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.520]   whether that means me going down to part-time
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.820]   and her continuing part-time,
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.100]   or she really enjoys her part-time work,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.060]   so I would like for her to be able to continue doing that.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.280]   I guess my question is,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.960]   I can tell you what I'm thinking is that
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.160]   potentially we just exit the vacation property
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.600]   and allow ourselves a little bit more room
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.280]   to reduce income.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.120]   But the other option would be,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.680]   of course, we maybe skip homeschooling
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.480]   and continue to both work the current amount
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.440]   that we're working.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.240]   Sort of general, I guess I just don't know
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.480]   if there's maybe some ways you would advise me
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.600]   to think about this,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.640]   thinking about sort of these multiple priorities.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.200]   - Let me clarify, your eldest is three
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.480]   and you also have a younger child?
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.080]   - That's correct, and we hope to have another one,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.360]   maybe by the end of 23 or early 24.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.180]   - And of the $250,000 household income,
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.840]   how much of that do you generate
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.340]   and how much of that does your wife generate?
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.160]   - Yeah, so she's doing about 80
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.440]   and I'm doing the other 170.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.360]   ♪ Listen in the mornin' ♪

[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.560]   (sighs)
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   If your wife wants to stop working
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.040]   or if she wants to make income generation
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.120]   a more modest priority, what I mean is,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.480]   you said, okay, she really likes her work,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.440]   she wants to stay involved in it,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.600]   you can work around that, but the key is
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.560]   just to separate yourself from it financially,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.160]   that you're not dependent on it.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.320]   But you should certainly be able
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.080]   to comfortably provide that.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.340]   The hardest situations are when you have
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.440]   a household income of 250 and you earn 125
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.360]   or she earns 125.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.520]   When there's a, then it's like, well, what do we do?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.080]   Where do we go, how do we make the money work?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.600]   We lose half our income.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   In your situation, because you earn two thirds
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.000]   and she earns a third, then you can handle that
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   and you can deal with that.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.120]   So here are a couple of framework questions.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.680]   Number one, your child is three.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.500]   None of this is particularly pressing.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.440]   You're in greater need of childcare
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.060]   than you are of quote unquote homeschooling.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.140]   Homeschooling in the early years
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.680]   is much more about character development,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.980]   it's much more about personality shaping,
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.440]   it's much more about relationship development
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.800]   than it is about anything academic.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.760]   And academics, you don't need to think about
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.380]   at all about academics for three or four years.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.760]   Now, this is actually one of the reasons
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.140]   why it's so important that you make
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.340]   whatever decisions you're gonna make now.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.300]   I'm convinced that the most important years
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.100]   are the first few years for, in terms of
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.580]   shaping a child's personality,
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.440]   shaping a child's character, et cetera.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   And that's why it's so hard to hire those things out
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.540]   or institutionalize those things.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.120]   As huge of an advocate as I personally am
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.000]   for homeschooling, there's no denying the fact
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.940]   that you can hire excellent teachers
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.460]   to teach your child academic subjects.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.000]   There are many very high quality schools,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.180]   private schools, Christian schools, government schools.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.540]   There are lots of wonderful schools out there
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.740]   with dedicated teachers who do a great job
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.860]   at teaching academics.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.300]   The problem is, how do you hire somebody
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.860]   to shape your child's character?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.880]   How do you hire someone to teach your child virtue?
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.540]   How do you hire someone to instill these things
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.200]   into your child?
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.660]   You can't do it.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.660]   The only person that can do it is a mom.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.100]   That's it.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.180]   A mom who has the patience to be with a two year old,
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.180]   a three year old, has the patience to work with,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.840]   to encourage kindness, to encourage stick-to-itiveness,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.900]   to build relationship connection.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.340]   And so, when you institutionalize your three year old,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.220]   you're taking the most valuable years of life
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.040]   and you're putting those years of life
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.640]   into the hands of a minimum wage
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.320]   or close to minimum wage clerk kind of thing.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.860]   And that person, that daycare worker,
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.640]   even if he or she is beautifully dedicated,
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   is never gonna have the patience
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   that you and your wife are gonna have with your own child.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.360]   And so, it's not a homeschooling question,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.600]   it's a child raising question.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.700]   That's the most important thing.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.080]   And you're already there.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.860]   You're not there from a schooling perspective,
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.500]   you're there now from a child raising perspective.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.260]   Now, one of the great things to look at
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.520]   is if both you and your wife
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.340]   have significant demands on your time,
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.580]   you have a few basic strategies.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.600]   Strategy number one is one of you can become
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.400]   a full-time parent or close to a full-time parent.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.380]   In some situations, that can be the father.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.620]   In your situation, it would obviously be your wife.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.220]   If she can minimize her work to just enough
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.060]   for her to stay current and connected to her interests
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.860]   and her love of whatever she does, et cetera,
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.780]   and if you hope to have more children,
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.600]   then it is obviously a solution
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.440]   for her to be a stay-at-home mom.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.940]   And you just do whatever is necessary
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.560]   to make the finances work.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.980]   Notice you don't necessarily have to trim expenses,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.620]   you can increase income.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.360]   And sometimes, what's necessary
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.640]   is just for you to decide to do it.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.840]   And so, not everyone can increase income,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.760]   but in your situation, you can figure out a way
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.020]   to live on $170,000 very comfortably,
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.820]   and/or you can increase your income.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.980]   You can increase your income
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.340]   that's associated with your employment or your business.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.840]   You can also increase your income
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.640]   that's associated with the thing, right, the vacation home.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.520]   And so, obviously, you've considered things
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.820]   like short-term rentals or even longer-term rentals,
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.140]   but if your wife gives up her income from her job,
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.260]   or let's say half of it,
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.280]   and she's making 30 or $40,000 doing it part-time,
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.700]   and she's also making $20,000 a year
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.980]   from your vacation home,
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.520]   well, now the bite is not so big,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.340]   especially when you factor in the costs of,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.820]   the saved costs of childcare, et cetera.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.660]   So, choice number one is you can have one parent
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.180]   become a stay-at-home parent.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.060]   That's a great choice,
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.660]   and I think in many cases, it's an ideal choice.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.220]   Unless a mom or a dad is just not suited
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.260]   to being with children all the time for some reason,
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.180]   a handicap or a physical ability
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.760]   or emotional instability or something like that,
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.020]   I think in many cases, that's the best solution.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.060]   You also look and say, is there another family member?
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.180]   So, this is where grandparents can be hugely helpful.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.020]   And for many people, they say,
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:11.020]   hey, we still have an income,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.060]   or we need to work,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.060]   but is there another family member
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.540]   who doesn't have an income
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.180]   or who could provide some form of childcare?
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.860]   So, grandparent, sister, close family friend,
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.400]   doing something with another couple
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.620]   that we like from church or something like that.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.380]   Then you also look and say,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.540]   is there a way that we can adjust schedules?
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.580]   So, some parents can handle this very well
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.380]   because he works four days a week
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.520]   and she works three days a week.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.300]   We don't have a lot of days off together,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.500]   but at least one of us was with the children all the time.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.780]   And then you can go to institutions,
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.640]   but you can try to choose your institutions
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.060]   really strategically.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.560]   So, you try to choose an institution
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.760]   that provides you with more of what you're looking for.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.460]   And in some cases, maybe that's,
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   we found a wonderful daycare, four hours a day,
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.420]   and that's just enough to where then,
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.660]   one of us can pick our daughter up
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.760]   and be with her from noon to eight.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.380]   The point is that I think at the ideal perspective,
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.640]   you probably have two full-time parents.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.060]   And then at the least ideal perspective,
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.360]   you get your child up at sunup,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.920]   you rush him out of the house and rush him to a daycare
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.000]   and you pick him up right before he goes to bed.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.040]   And so, finding a practical solution
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.880]   between those is the key.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.120]   Now, what's going to make the difference for you
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.600]   is just simply the level of conviction
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.760]   that you have about it.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.040]   It's not gonna be a financial question.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.960]   You could figure out the finances
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.940]   if you had the level of conviction.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.240]   So, I have a high level of conviction,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.400]   which is why I speak clearly and try to convey that to you,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.760]   while of course being respectful
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.160]   of each person's own individual choices.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.920]   But because I have a high level of conviction,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.080]   I know that I would do whatever it takes
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.560]   to make this happen.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.680]   And that drives my decisions.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.020]   It's not a matter of whether or not
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.880]   to take this course of action.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.120]   It's a matter of how does it make the most sense
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.600]   for our family to take this course of action.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.880]   If you have that level of conviction,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   then you will be able to chart out the path to get there.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.480]   And if that means sell the vacation home, done.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.040]   You can always buy another vacation home
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.800]   five years from now, no big deal.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.080]   If you're lacking that conviction though,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.520]   then recognize that that is what you're missing.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.040]   It's not a pathway through the finances,
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   it's the conviction.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.200]   And so, you just wanna think about it, talk about it,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.520]   and between you and your wife, make whatever decisions
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.400]   and consider what your level of conviction is.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.480]   And if your conviction is low
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.960]   because you have a great, you know,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.280]   just a daycare at the house across the street
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.720]   by this wonderful family that has beautiful children,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.880]   wonderful, done.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.400]   If your conviction is high
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.240]   because you have to just take your child
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   and enroll him in a subpar environment,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.440]   well then the answer is obvious.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.000]   So, what I'm focusing on is don't mistake
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.200]   financial constraints with need for conviction.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.520]   If you have the conviction,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.720]   then the financial path will be fairly evident.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   You've already laid it out.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's either increase income or decrease expenses,
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.360]   fix whichever one of those ones makes more sense to you.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.800]   Or if you need more conviction,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.960]   then spend your time thinking about that
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.240]   and don't worry about the money
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.880]   until you develop the conviction.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.360]   - Yep, that makes sense.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.880]   I think you could probably sense that the conviction is low.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.280]   We are just sort of starting to talk through this.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.520]   Like I said, she's only three, right?
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.720]   So, we've got a couple years before academics start.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.720]   So, we're just trying to make sure, you know,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.880]   that we're being intentional about materials
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   that we're looking at and just, you know,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.520]   making sure that we're putting everything on the table
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.620]   so we can make the right call when it comes time.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.760]   I guess one quick question.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.080]   I'm not gonna ask you for homeschooling resources.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.960]   Do you have any, have you ever read anything
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.880]   that you would recommend about someone
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.980]   who has an anti-homeschooling view?
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.200]   We wanna make sure that we read both sides of this thing.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   - Yeah, no, it's a very perceptive question and excellent.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.920]   So, from the anti-homeschooling view,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.040]   there are a couple of major schools of thought.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.200]   No pun intended.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.600]   Usually I intend my puns,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.440]   but I should acknowledge when they're not intended.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.960]   The first school of thought has to do,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.760]   or the first major objection.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.480]   So, actually, let me start in reverse order.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.840]   The first major objection is generally practical, right?
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.480]   It's the situation that you're facing right now.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   Our modern world is set up for mom and dad to have jobs
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.040]   and make an income and to be professionals
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.360]   and then to go hire professionals to teach the children.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.600]   That's the norm.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.880]   And I don't know any homeschooling families
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.680]   that have not sacrificed tremendously to do that.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.000]   That's why I say it does come down to a level of conviction.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.160]   Virtually all of the homeschooling families that I know,
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.360]   and I'm racking my brain,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.920]   I'm sure there's a couple of exceptions,
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.000]   which I'm trying to say virtually, right?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.880]   But most homeschooling families that I know
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   could make a whole lot more money,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.720]   could live in a nicer house,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.760]   could have lots more spendable money
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.960]   if they weren't committed to homeschooling.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.760]   And the homeschooling costs a lot.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.080]   It costs a lot in terms of foregone income
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.640]   for the homeschooling parent.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.520]   It costs a lot in terms of family lifestyle.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.240]   It costs a lot, especially most of the time,
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   it's a homeschooling mom,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.600]   it costs her a lot in terms of her career potential,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.440]   et cetera.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.240]   And so you have to have a conviction
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.080]   where it's worth that cost.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.200]   I think it is.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.640]   Homeschooling families that do it
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.720]   generally come to the conviction that it is.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.440]   If they don't come to that conviction,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   then they just switch back and they move on with their lives.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.000]   But those who you see do it
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.880]   have come to the conclusion that it's there.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.040]   But it's not cost-free.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   We're all pretty aware of the costs,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.480]   but we do it because we want the benefits.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.280]   Now, so the first reason is practical, right?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.480]   If I'm coaching a single mom
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.640]   who has limited career potential and she's making,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.360]   I actually knew a friend of mine,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   a lady in our church growing up was like this.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.520]   She was a single mother,
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.760]   she had four daughters
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.040]   and she had very limited career potential.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   I would not encourage her to homeschool.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.800]   No one did encourage her to homeschool.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.040]   And today, if I were doing it,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.720]   I would not encourage her to homeschool.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.600]   What she did in her situation was she had a,
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   and she was a single mother with a very low income.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.920]   Her ex-husband was very unreliable
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.680]   with regard to child support, et cetera, and she struggled.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.360]   So what she did was she rented a little house
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.920]   that was close to a local Christian school.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.880]   She worked at that Christian school driving a bus
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.400]   as well as working in the lunchroom.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.920]   And that allowed her to have significantly
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.160]   discounted tuition for all of her daughters
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.480]   to enroll them in the school
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.560]   and that allowed them to make it through.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.600]   And so she was able to give her children
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.000]   the highest quality education that she could,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.560]   but without going and doing homeschooling.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.240]   There's no way that I can see
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   where she would ever be able to homeschool.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.040]   But she didn't just settle for enrolling her children
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.880]   in the government school.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.920]   She worked really hard to give them the education
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.040]   that she wanted for them.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   And I've known quite a lot of single mothers
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.760]   who have done similar things.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.200]   They work night and day to try to enroll their children
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.280]   in a high quality private school of some kind
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.400]   that's gonna give their children more educational advantages
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.800]   than they can get in the government school system.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.480]   The other flip side is I've also known many parents
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.160]   who enrolled their children in the government school system
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.560]   and just simply supplemented it significantly
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.440]   so that their children had a higher quality education.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.880]   That supplementation can come to family environment
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.780]   and background.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.440]   Asian cultures are famous for this, right?
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   They'll come to the, many Asians around the world
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.960]   have immigrated to the United States.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.200]   They enroll their children into government schools,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.080]   but they have such a culture of studiousness
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.480]   and academic performance,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.400]   and the parents hold very high standards for their children
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.080]   so the children succeed in school
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.080]   and they get moved on to the gifted track.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.660]   And once they're on the gifted track
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.000]   in a government school, then they can write their ticket
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.560]   and so they can achieve a very high level
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.640]   of academic education.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   And a lot of times when you can move your child
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   out of the median group into the gifted group,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.400]   then you can improve the social environment
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.960]   where you get into better families, better students,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.880]   fewer problems, less bullying, less harassment, et cetera,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.000]   and you can get better problems.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.680]   And so the first reason people don't homeschool,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.800]   the biggest reason is simply the practicality
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.440]   of needing to have a full-time teacher.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.280]   Now, I don't know anybody who doesn't homeschool
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.880]   because they believe that the government
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   is gonna do a better job.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.500]   If you look at the people who are the loudest advocates
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.580]   of government schooling and the loudest opponents
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.460]   of homeschooling, very frequently they themselves
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.380]   do not participate in the industrial
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.980]   government school system.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   So President Obama and First Lady Obama
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   did not enroll their children
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.620]   into the local government school,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.020]   even though they would be the first to step up and say,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.180]   well, we should limit homeschooling,
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.060]   we should maximize government schools.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.540]   Most politicians enroll their children
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.220]   into the elite private schools that are available to them.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.060]   But this is a significant area of opposition
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.420]   from in the political sphere.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.860]   What I'm trying to point out is it's not
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.620]   in the practical sphere, but it is in the political sphere.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.620]   In the political sphere, a major objection
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.060]   to homeschooling involves the lack of ability
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.660]   by government officials to coordinate curricula,
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.900]   to coordinate one consistent curricula
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.460]   that all people are, curriculum, excuse me,
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.780]   that all people are passed through,
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.060]   and the ability to use the schools to shape the culture,
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.220]   shape the civic culture, shape the perspectives
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.340]   and opinions of the people.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.460]   And so this is usually the hot political debate.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.620]   And people say, well, parents shouldn't have the right
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.540]   to pull their children out of schools.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.060]   If you look at the countries in the world
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.980]   where homeschooling is strictly illegal, right,
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.820]   Germany, Sweden, et cetera, the reason has largely
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.940]   to do with this idea of government indoctrination.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.640]   And so like the Germany's anti-homeschooling laws
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.060]   are an artifact of the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.340]   So Adolf Hitler instituted mandatory schooling
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.300]   and forbade individual privatized schooling
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.180]   as a way of shaping the minds
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.960]   and the ideology of the people.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.020]   So after World War II, Germany threw off virtually
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:05.020]   all of the Nazi era kind of social programs,
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.460]   et cetera, except this one.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.300]   And so it's a remaining artifact from that mind control era
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.940]   that the government has chosen to continue to pass forward.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.820]   And so that is a big objection that many people have
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.300]   is that how are we gonna survive if everyone,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.740]   if parents have the right to educate their children
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.740]   the way that they should be?
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.300]   And so the point is this is an objection,
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.020]   but it's not a practical objection,
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.060]   it's a philosophical objection.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.240]   The next objection that you will hear has a lot to do
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.700]   with the professionalization of teaching.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.220]   And so teachers say, listen,
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.940]   I was a trained professional teacher.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.540]   I went to a teaching college, I have a four-year degree,
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.080]   undergraduate degree in elementary education.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.540]   I can do a much better job teaching your child
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.700]   than some uneducated mother.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.740]   How is that possible?
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.580]   And so it is important to recognize this.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.060]   And I think that unfortunately,
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.220]   there's a severe lack of confidence
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.540]   on behalf of many homeschooling mothers,
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.740]   that homeschooling mothers have this
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.300]   major inferiority complex where they go through life
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.740]   wondering is what I'm doing okay?
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.140]   Like, am I doing good enough?
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.460]   Should I do better?
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.800]   And they think that somehow the professionalization
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.280]   of teaching is necessary.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.100]   I myself think that this is largely nonsense
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.060]   from a couple of perspectives.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.180]   Number one, it's nonsense because generally the stuff
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.860]   that we're talking about teaching is pretty basic stuff.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.160]   If you can read and if you have a book
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.900]   that gives you an outline of how to teach someone to read,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.780]   then you can probably teach someone to read.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.460]   You don't need to go to college for four years
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.540]   to teach someone to read.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.740]   If professional help is needed, so for example,
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.360]   let's say that your child has a speech impediment,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.380]   or let's say that your child has a learning disability,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.720]   dyslexia or some other various learning disabilities,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.340]   then that's where I think professional training
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.460]   is very, very helpful.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.160]   But even in that situation, I would still bet
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.280]   on the mother rather than the professional
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.760]   every single time.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.880]   Because the mother in schooling her child with disabilities
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.600]   is the one who has the motivation
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.320]   to seek out the world's best therapies.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.280]   The mother is the one who has the motivation
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.900]   and the time to make sure that those therapies
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.160]   are accomplished.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.920]   And she's gonna be able to do a lot more
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.320]   than a teacher who has to work with 10 children
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.040]   who are in need of therapies.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.800]   And so I think you definitely want to seek out
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.720]   the advice of experts if you have a unique child
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.600]   with a disability, et cetera,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.000]   but that expert is your consultant
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.280]   and you're doing the work at home,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.500]   just like with physical therapy, right?
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.880]   If your child has some other physical disability,
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.040]   well, your physical therapist is gonna do
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.480]   his professional work, but you're gonna supplement it
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   with all of the work that you're gonna do at home.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.720]   So I don't think that there's the professionalization
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.500]   of teaching is something that is necessary,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.400]   and it's certainly not necessary in the elementary school,
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.800]   middle school, and high school.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.900]   If and when professionalization of teaching is necessary,
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.140]   you can and should access those professionals.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.720]   So let's say your child wants to learn violin.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.760]   Well, violin seems to me like one of those things
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.960]   that is generally not acquired well through reading books.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.600]   You don't read books about violin
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.020]   to learn to play the violin.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.440]   And you're gonna have a hard time teaching a child
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.900]   to play the violin if you yourself don't play the violin.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.460]   And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna go
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.980]   and find a violin teacher.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.420]   And this is the same thing that homeschooling parents do,
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.780]   is they bring in professionals
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.520]   when those professionals are warranted.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.100]   You hire a violin teacher, you hire a calculus tutor,
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.460]   you hire a chemistry tutor, or something.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.460]   When there's a subject where you need
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.180]   a specific professional input,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.540]   then you go and you hire that professional input.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.300]   But most subjects are not this way.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.920]   High school chemistry does not need an expert to teach it.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.360]   All you need is a chemistry book, a few chemistry books.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640]   And in some cases, a little bit of apparatus.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.040]   But even the apparatus is not necessary, right?
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.700]   You're not actually doing experiments,
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.880]   generally, in high school.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.000]   You're just following directions
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.720]   and doing chemical recipes
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.980]   that are supposed to tell you something
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.060]   about how the process works.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.800]   So most knowledge that can and should be acquired
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.640]   is acquired much more simply than people think.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.280]   And this is where I go back to kind of teaching modality.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.300]   When you have a child who is older,
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.660]   the most important tool to use for the curriculum
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.040]   that a child is following is simply accessing
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.640]   and absorbing knowledge from high-quality books.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.800]   Because there you get a professional teacher,
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.320]   an author who is an expert at a subject,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.660]   who has created a book that's going to open the eyes
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.620]   of the student and teach the student what he needs to know
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.880]   and is gonna do it in a vastly superior way
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.920]   than a classroom teacher can do.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.820]   And this is what drove me crazy myself
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.300]   throughout high school.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.260]   Not everybody learns well through books.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.100]   Maybe that's the case.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.200]   I should give my caveats, right?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.760]   Maybe some people like to sit in class
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.980]   and listen to lectures.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.820]   But it drove me crazy that my high school experience
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.040]   was we would have a textbook, right?
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.420]   McGraw-Hill went out and hired five PhD chemistry people
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.660]   or five PhD biology people to write a biology textbook.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.320]   And they sat down and they wrote a book
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.080]   with 400 pages in it and 30 chapters,
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.580]   teaching systematically, carefully, and clearly
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.380]   everything that was needed in the textbook.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.720]   And they laid it out, and not only did they put in
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.460]   the useful text, but they put in diagrams,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.280]   pictures, charts.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.340]   They highlight the key points.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.860]   They put in titles and bullet points.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.460]   At the end of every section, they put comprehension
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.020]   questions and review questions, and then they give you
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.580]   all the answers to those things so you can go through them.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.740]   And so then you walk into ninth grade marine biology.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.180]   You're issued this textbook, and then you proceed
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.780]   to listen to a teacher who has a few years
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.380]   of teaching experience go through and deliver her lectures
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   of what she thinks you need to know to pass her test
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.580]   on marine biology.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.420]   And you wind up reading cumulatively 75 to 100 pages
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.420]   of this 400-page textbook.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.140]   It wasn't until I was doing my graduate work
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.220]   after my undergrad degree that I actually read a textbook.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.800]   Prior to that time, I hated textbooks
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.580]   because I just thought they were boring, et cetera.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.700]   But when I did my graduate degree, for the first time,
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.860]   all of my study was all self-directed.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.020]   The way it worked was they sent me a textbook,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.940]   I read the textbook, and then I had an exam.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.780]   And so I started reading textbooks, and I came to learn
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.380]   how wonderful textbooks actually are.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.740]   And I thought, back to my high school and college experience,
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.620]   and I thought, why did I sit for hours and hours
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.400]   listening to somebody give subpar presentations
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.380]   when I could have simply read the textbook?
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.580]   And that's a personal thing.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.900]   Again, maybe some people like those kinds of presentations.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.740]   I think there's a place for lectures,
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.580]   but there's not a need for lectures
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.180]   for high school-level subjects.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.940]   There's a need for lectures when you're dealing
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.980]   with very kind of new, cutting-edge science
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.460]   or graduate-level stuff, or a seminar where the lecturer
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.540]   is going to be able to enhance what you've already read
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.740]   in the textbook, or something like that.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.360]   We're not, when we deal with K through 12 stuff,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.900]   nothing here is cutting-edge.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.980]   You don't need a professional teacher.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.000]   What you need is a coach and a guide.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.300]   You need a teacher to help with some of the basics
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.180]   of reading, of learning to read,
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.980]   the basics of learning mathematics,
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.700]   the first kind of few lessons.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.820]   And then you need somebody who's capable of seeking out
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.220]   the best books and guiding the child
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.300]   into reading those best books, et cetera.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.260]   Let me go more, give one more example.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.900]   What about something like writing?
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.140]   Do you need somebody who is gonna grade
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.700]   and address, improve somebody's writing?
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   What if you have a mother who is illiterate
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.100]   and who is teaching her children to write?
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.440]   First, we have, do you need a professional teacher then?
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.020]   My answer is still no, probably not.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.860]   It would be helpful, probably in some cases, but not.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.740]   The best example here would go to Dr. Ben Carlson,
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.660]   the famed neurosurgeon, who, he and his brother
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:32.700]   only found out after they were extremely accomplished
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.540]   and very well-educated that their mother
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.340]   was completely illiterate, but she required them
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.020]   to spend their time reading books.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.660]   And then they, of course, went through government schools
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.260]   and they had help from the teachers and whatnot
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.820]   who were there, and they became very, very skilled.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.280]   But what was the thing that their mother did for them?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.100]   She required them to read a lot.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.940]   And the key to being something like a good writer
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.620]   is not to have a teacher go through your writing
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.380]   with a red pen and mark everything.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.000]   The key to being a good writer is to spend lots of time
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.060]   doing good reading, and then to have something
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.380]   that you care about enough to write about.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.700]   So I believe that writing is important,
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.880]   but I don't think that the grading of writing
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.560]   is particularly important.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.780]   There are perhaps a few things that can help, right?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.340]   Pointing out a misspelling or something,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.900]   but most of that is not necessary.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.460]   What is necessary is to create an environment
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.540]   where a student spends time reading quality literature
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.500]   and then has an opportunity to write about things
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.260]   that he cares about rather than to have
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.740]   a professional teacher.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.420]   So I went into that one because I think this is the big,
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.940]   probably the biggest reason people don't homeschool,
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.500]   other than practicality.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.540]   The practical features are a big deal,
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.780]   and then also, well, I'm not a professional, right?
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.060]   I need a professional.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.820]   My answer is no, you don't.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   You need a loving coach.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.620]   You need someone who's knowledgeable.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.840]   You do need to know what the best books are,
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.560]   but the great thing, especially in the English
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.140]   homeschooling world, is you could pretty much
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.500]   pick any curriculum or any book list and go through it,
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're gonna be in a really great scenario.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:13.340]   Finally, I think the biggest downside of homeschooling
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.400]   has to do with the social aspect.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.580]   Let me describe, though, specifically what I mean
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.000]   by the social aspect.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.500]   I don't know any homeschoolers who are hermits.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.980]   The socialization objection is the most commonly
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.740]   heard objection to homeschooling.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.540]   People say, well, how will my children learn social skills?
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.900]   That, to me, that objection is presented by people
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.380]   who have never spent any time thinking about it,
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.840]   and let me answer that objection,
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.540]   and I'll give you what I think is the real objection.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   The first objection is, well, if children are at home
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.580]   all the time, they're not gonna learn how to socialize
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.180]   with other people their age.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.580]   My first answer to this is there is positive socialization
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.780]   and there is negative socialization.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.620]   There are many children in the world
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.500]   with whom I do not want my children to interact
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.180]   in any way whatsoever, because I do not want my children
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.580]   to be affected by those children,
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.980]   and so an uncontrolled social environment
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.660]   that takes all children, for example,
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:20.340]   in one 10-block area and sticks them into a room
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.340]   in an age-banded environment where it's all the 12-year-olds
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.340]   within this 10-block area, and then creates an adult
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.740]   to child ratio that is 20 to one or 30 to one,
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.780]   that is a recipe for disaster.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.300]   It's one of the most artificial, destructive,
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.980]   social environments you can possibly imagine.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   It takes away the normal social structure of socialization
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.340]   where you have adults that you look up to,
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.620]   where you have peers that you enjoy being with
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.940]   and that you work with, and that you have younger people
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.900]   that you coach and that you lead,
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.220]   and it just strips all that out and sticks people
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.900]   in an age-banded classroom.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.780]   And then, without the ability to discriminate
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.500]   against well-behaved students and poorly-behaved students,
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.380]   against students with good character, good virtue,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.780]   good morals, and students with poor character
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.620]   and no virtue and low morals,
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.940]   it creates an environment for destruction,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.280]   and the leaders never win.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.340]   You always go down to the least common denominator.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.740]   You can have 15 children who show up
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.620]   and who want to learn every day,
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.520]   and you have five children that show up
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.940]   who just wanna goof off and play games.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.380]   The 15 children are not gonna bring the five children up.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.600]   The five children are gonna ruin the experience
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.580]   for the other 15, and the only way to deal with that
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.700]   is either to have a system of very high discipline
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.460]   where you can discipline and force the behavior
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.480]   of the five children to change
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.040]   or to remove the five children from the classroom.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.100]   That's it, because your entire classroom environment
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.620]   will be destroyed by those who are there
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.040]   in a destructive capacity.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   And so, this is the basic problem with government schools.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.200]   Government schools cannot discriminate against students.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.120]   They can only have all of the students
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.080]   that are in that area.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.960]   Now, there is, of course, the positive side to that
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.800]   that we all appreciate,
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.280]   the anti-discrimination fights that have gone through,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.800]   but today, what that means is you have to accept everybody,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.280]   and the government school teachers
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   have very few tools of discipline,
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   especially at the more modest levels.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.820]   And so, what this means is when you enroll your child
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.840]   into a government school,
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.680]   you're putting them into one
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.360]   of the most dangerous environments
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.480]   where the thugs and the bullies and the predators
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.440]   on all sides are not controlled
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.120]   by the discipline of the system.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.380]   And so, at the very least,
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.440]   you can move into a private school environment
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.480]   where they can have stronger tools of discipline
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.160]   and they can expel more freely troublemakers.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.520]   And this is one of the biggest reasons
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.940]   why most wealthy people don't frequent government schools.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.260]   You cannot thrive in a system
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.000]   where you have even a small percentage
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.400]   of undealt-with troublemakers
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.280]   because they will destroy the atmosphere
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.720]   for the entire group.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.560]   So, the socialization that happens in schools
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.840]   is often negative socialization.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.080]   It's not positive socialization.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.880]   And here, I have some interesting insight
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.200]   because of my own experience.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.160]   I was homeschooled, with the exception of third grade,
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.120]   when I went to a government school.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.760]   I was homeschooled through seventh grade.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.160]   In seventh grade, I went to a traditional
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.840]   local private Christian school.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.240]   And in that context, for the first time in my life,
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.740]   I understood what class systems were.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.800]   I understood what bullying was.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.440]   I understood what all those things were.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.280]   Prior to seventh grade, I had always been
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.520]   in a completely loving environment,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.400]   a kind environment.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.840]   Everyone had always treated me well.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.000]   I had never had any kind of question about self-esteem.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.060]   I was involved in a family where I was loved
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.400]   and I was appreciated and I was cared for.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.860]   And then I went into a school where all of a sudden,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.080]   even though it was a better environment
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.640]   than it would have faced in a government school
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.400]   because of the ability of the school
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.360]   to restrict the specific students that are enrolled in it,
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.980]   i.e. discrimination, I was in a better environment,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.000]   but it still had kind of all of those things.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.960]   And I vividly remember, number one,
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.720]   how quickly I started to be aware of how I fit
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.320]   into the pecking order.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.520]   But what was worse is I look back with shame
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.480]   and I can think of a couple instances
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.240]   where I myself partook in starting to bully other students.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.480]   Now, thankfully, I never was physically aggressive.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.500]   I never punched anybody.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.680]   I never threw anybody in a locker, et cetera.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.920]   My bullying was limited in scope to saying unkind things
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.960]   or basically taunting and teasing.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.120]   But I was taught by the environment
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.880]   that there were some kids that you looked up to
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.560]   and there were some kids that you taunted, that you teased.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.040]   And it was years later, several years after high school,
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.640]   I went to a high school reunion and I went
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.040]   and I sought out two of the boys that I remembered
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.880]   and I apologized to them because it took me years
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.520]   to realize how I had mistreated them.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.680]   And again, I didn't ever physically assault anybody.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.520]   I just teased people, but still I was ashamed of it.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.200]   And so I was taught, even in the most
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.760]   quote unquote positive environment,
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.080]   a private, selective Christian school,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.920]   I was taught those social dynamics,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.240]   those negative social dynamics by my classmates,
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.960]   things that I never would have done previously.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.720]   I never would have been unkind to somebody.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.680]   I never would have chosen to pick on somebody
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.940]   because the group was.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.280]   But once I got in that environment,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.240]   within a year I realized that this was the thing
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.800]   that was to be done.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.040]   So negative socialization is a big problem
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.120]   of the school environment.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.740]   And it's a problem, especially in government schools,
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.360]   but it's still a problem in private schools.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.040]   The way I talk about this is quite simply
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.280]   that most people are not prepared,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.320]   until they're in their 20s, are probably not prepared
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   to face the hell that is middle school.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.600]   I don't understand why we do this to our children.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.160]   Elementary school for most people
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   is a pretty happy-go-lucky environment
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.520]   and people like them and everyone's kind.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   And they go through elementary school,
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.400]   they get to middle school, and then it just turns
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.240]   into a hell for a lot of people.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.520]   And they start to build up calluses and whatnot.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.640]   Many people go to high school and it's a little bit better.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.400]   And I remember this feeling when I got to college.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.960]   And I looked at all of the weird-looking theater kids
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520]   hanging out together and I thought to myself one day,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.240]   they're having fun.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.120]   And I had always kind of had to hide a little bit
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.360]   that I enjoyed theater and I enjoyed singing.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.140]   I was never a theater kid.
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.240]   But I remember when I got to college
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   and I saw the theater kids like, they're having fun.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.840]   They have friends who think like them.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.360]   And then I got out of college and I realized
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.720]   that once you're an adult, you can associate
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.880]   with whomever you want to associate with.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.040]   You can associate with people who are kind to you,
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.560]   people who make you feel good.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.080]   And I realized that this forced association
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.440]   of the school system is so destructive.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.080]   You know, when I reached 25 years old,
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.840]   I felt like, you know what, I could probably go back
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.560]   to high school now and deal with it.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.040]   But the average high schooler can't deal with it.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.500]   And my evidence for that is look at everything
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.580]   from at the hardcore rate, the suicide rate
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.680]   in the United States, all the way up to just
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.800]   the weird social vices that people have.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.000]   So it's a huge problem.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.320]   Now, let me continue to the other aspects of socialization.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.360]   I think that once we step away from the negative
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.000]   socialization of schooling, which is primarily caused
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.720]   by the structure, the artificial structure
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.860]   of forced association of students
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.200]   in age-banded environments, the socialization
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.880]   that does happen generally doesn't happen very well.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.200]   So you say, well, I'm gonna go to school to see my friends,
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.040]   but I'm gonna see my friends for the four minutes
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.640]   between classes, and then we're gonna whisper
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.760]   in the back of the room.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.920]   Or I'm gonna go to school and enjoy my lunch break
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.680]   with my friends and enjoy the 25 minutes
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.760]   that we have to eat lunch and visit.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.860]   Well, that stuff's really great,
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.500]   but it's not quality socialization.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.440]   It's not a time where you actually have significant time
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.840]   to interact with your friends.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   And so one of my huge objections to schooling
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.680]   is that it's a colossal waste of time.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.920]   If you look at the amount of time
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.160]   that the average teacher can spend teaching
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.760]   in a classroom environment, I think that,
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.240]   let's say you have a 50-minute period.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.920]   Of course, some schools have different scheduling,
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.800]   block scheduling, et cetera.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.600]   But let's say you have a 50-minute period.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   I think the maximum that a teacher could expect to teach
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.440]   from a 50-minute period is probably 25 minutes,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.880]   right, 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.920]   And so if you look at the actual percentage of time used
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   by the 15 to 18,000 hours that we enroll a child in school,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.680]   the actual learning time of that 15 to 18,000 hours
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   is probably something on the range of
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.760]   three to 5,000 hours total.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.220]   And yet we suck up all of this time
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.080]   and we have subpar learning opportunities
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.420]   and we have subpar socialization opportunities
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.600]   because there's not free association.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.380]   There's not actually a lot of time spent together.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.660]   From the learning opportunities,
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.960]   if you go to homeschooling
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   or more interest-directed individualized learning,
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.920]   you could have a significantly higher level of learning
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.480]   happen in a dramatically lower, less amount of time.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.880]   So let's go back to that ninth grade
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.260]   marine biology classroom.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.680]   Teacher's standing up in front of the room.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.640]   She's got a 50-minute period
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.800]   and she's probably gonna have 25 minutes of teaching.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.920]   Well, she's gonna teach her 25 minutes
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.240]   using verbal expression.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.840]   I'm using verbal expression right now.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.320]   I'm talking fast, I think fast, and I talk fast, pretty fast.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.360]   And some of you are listening to me at 2X speed.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.600]   In fact, many of you are.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.020]   In a classroom, you can't listen at a 2X speed.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.800]   The maximum verbal rate of delivery
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.440]   for a prepared presentation
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.320]   is probably about 8,000 words per hour.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.120]   I measure because of my language interests.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.840]   I've measured the average audio books that I listen to.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.040]   And so a professional audio book narrator
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.760]   reading an audio book from a prepared book
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.160]   reads usually at a rate of about 8,000 words per hour.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.100]   So if a teacher has 25 minutes,
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.760]   she's probably going to be able to deliver
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.980]   about 3,000 to 4,000 words of instructional content
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.000]   in that period of time, of actual 25 minutes of teaching.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.200]   That's assuming that every sentence is carefully chosen,
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.200]   that every piece of knowledge
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.360]   that she wants to impart in the presentation is prepared,
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.280]   it's outlined in advance, et cetera.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.200]   And so she stands up in front of the room
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.960]   and she conveys 3,000 to 5,000 words of information
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.720]   in a 50-minute class period.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.000]   But when you read and you use books
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.400]   as the primary method of acquiring that information,
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.560]   just give me a good quality marine biology textbook
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   and let me read it.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.520]   A normal skilled reader
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.080]   probably reads at the rate of 15,000 to 20,000 words per hour.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.800]   I read at about 25,000 to 30,000 words per hour in English.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.840]   I watch my students are reading,
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.240]   my children, my eldest is reading at a rate
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.840]   of something like 15,000 words per hour, I would say.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   And so what the teacher might take all week to accomplish
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.920]   at that 3,000 to 5,000 words per hour times five hours
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.640]   turns out to be basically one hour of reading
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.840]   for a student who's acquiring information.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.880]   And it's the same information, but actually a lot better.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.800]   Remember, the textbook is prepared by somebody
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   who took dozens of hours to plan it, to prepare it.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.480]   They prepared the best visuals, the best illustrations.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   They edited the text multiple times
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.040]   to make it really, really pithy.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.760]   So I think it's actually more extreme than that.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.320]   But basically it's a ratio of one hour of reading
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.680]   versus five hours of classroom instruction
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.800]   from an actual education perspective.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.260]   So what happens in homeschool is you swap out
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.080]   the five hours of class sitting
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.440]   and you substitute one hour of reading,
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.160]   which leaves four hours available for other stuff.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.760]   And so what you can do is you can say,
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.680]   let's do two hours of reading instead of one hour of reading
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.480]   so we double the academic accomplishment of learning,
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.240]   double the amount of information consumed,
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.880]   double the amount of learning.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.080]   And then we still have two hours,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.160]   we have an hour or two for socialization
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.840]   and an hour or two for, say, a part-time job
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.000]   or for, say, going and swimming at the reef
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.960]   and actually doing marine biology up close
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.220]   'cause we can do a field trip every week.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:24.220]   So in our homeschool, we do school four days a week
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:27.460]   and then we always have one to three days a week
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.060]   that's available for other stuff.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.100]   And then that actual learning time
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.300]   is constrained to something like,
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.780]   depending on the age, four to five hours.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.100]   And yet we can accomplish, if not twice,
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.380]   at least probably three times as much
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.420]   as a teacher can accomplish
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.540]   in kind of a normal structured environment.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.860]   So that opens up so many opportunities for socialization
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.980]   that are better and more positive.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.560]   So now the socialization that the children can do
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.340]   is lots and lots of time of playing together,
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.620]   the afternoons together, or working on projects
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.100]   or other events where you don't have
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.340]   that artificial forced socialization
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.360]   that happens in school classrooms,
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.180]   but you have more free association.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.700]   And so now if somebody is not treating you kindly,
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.220]   well, we're not going to play with that child anymore
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.740]   or we're just gonna walk away
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.020]   or whatever the appropriate response is
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.620]   and you get a much more reasonable approach.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.140]   Then the socialization that can happen
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.340]   can also happen across age barriers.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.580]   So you get older children teaching younger children,
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.380]   younger children looking up to older children,
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.980]   adults being involved, all of that kind of inter-age stuff
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.420]   that's really, really important and really, really healthy.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.540]   So socialization is in many cases
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.480]   the biggest objection that people have.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.020]   And they say, well, my homeschool student
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.160]   is gonna be weird.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.760]   There are lots of weird homeschool students,
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.420]   just like there are lots of weird students
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.820]   in government schools.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.540]   The weirdness that you have is largely gonna be driven
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.940]   by your parents or your own personal,
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.860]   unique peculiarities and personalities.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.040]   But my stance on weirdness is your weirdness
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.780]   is not gonna get better if you get enrolled into a school
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.580]   where you're bullied for being weird.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.440]   If I've got a child who is weird,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.020]   I'm gonna protect that child
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.380]   and allow his weirdness to work its way through
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.340]   and then we're gonna work on getting non-weird
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.260]   and then when he's non-weird,
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.100]   we'll kind of introduce more of those social pressures.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.680]   The other thing is just that weirdness
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.960]   is often a sign, something that you love.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.760]   Many of the greatest people in our history
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.400]   have often been those who were considered to be weird.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.280]   As adults, we call it eccentricity and we appreciate it
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.880]   or we just call it genius.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.700]   And yet when you put everyone into an environment
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:39.360]   where there's no adult perception
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.000]   on kind of what can happen,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   you wind up creating these weird things
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.760]   where people wanna insult them.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.040]   Now, socialization where homeschooling is subpar.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.000]   The biggest thing where homeschooling is subpar
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.800]   has to do with ability to access
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   a highly ranked group academic focus
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.240]   or something where you need a lot of people to do it.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.400]   And so let me give real examples.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.260]   Let's say that you're like hardcore into the classics
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.960]   and you wanna do all of your schooling in ancient Greek
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.920]   and you're gonna study the Greek philosophers hardcore.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.800]   I think in some cases, especially in the high school years,
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.560]   you're probably better off with a really high level
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.000]   kind of classical school for that kind of work
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.880]   than you are in a homeschool environment
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.600]   because while you can hire tutors
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.880]   in a homeschool environment and you can hire virtual,
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.340]   you can put people in virtual classes, et cetera,
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:42.200]   if you could get a group of say 10 or 15 students
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.480]   who were all in a hardcore classics program
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.280]   and you're speaking ancient Greek in class
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.040]   and you're doing all this through,
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.920]   that group dynamic of a very carefully chosen
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.760]   academic discipline is really, really positive.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.400]   This is the kind of thing that happens in college
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.000]   where you have a group of people
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   who are high level students
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.080]   and they get around other high level students
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.280]   and the creative juices that can grow
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.880]   and the positive peer pressure
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.440]   of a small group of people like that,
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.280]   that's really hard to create in a high school.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.680]   There are other things, so things like theater
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.200]   and things like sports.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.360]   Let's say that you have a child
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.240]   who seems very naturally gifted
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.400]   with vocal performance or acting.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.720]   Well, you're not gonna be able to maximize that talent
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.960]   in a homeschool environment.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.960]   There's just no practical way to do it.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.520]   Even if you went to the professional level,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.760]   that still has its own problems
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.040]   because in the same way that having your 16 year old
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.960]   who's good at basketball,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.000]   you don't put your 16 year old
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.040]   who's good at basketball in the NBA.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   There's something to be said for coming up
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.560]   through the ranks and learning with peers
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.800]   and people who are at your level
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.360]   and having time to make mistakes
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.080]   rather than experiencing professional pressures.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.240]   So if you have a child who's a talented vocal performer
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.160]   or a talented musician or something like that,
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.320]   in a homeschool environment,
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.360]   it's very hard to really fully actualize those things,
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.400]   especially if they relate to something where you need
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.480]   a big cast like musical theater.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.680]   Sports is the other example.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.560]   If your child is really skilled in football
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.320]   or in basketball, having a school environment
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   is generally gonna be the best place for that.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.080]   There are sports where homeschooling is much better.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.280]   So if you have individualized sports like swimming
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.780]   or archery or something like that,
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.280]   then having your child in a homeschool environment
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.440]   allows you to engage in much more training.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.360]   But in a team sports environment,
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.000]   you can't recreate that effectively
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.760]   in a homeschool environment.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.440]   The good thing is many of those things
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.960]   are accessible to homeschoolers.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.740]   They're accessible at the high school level.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.400]   So for example, many homeschoolers play sports
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.720]   at their local government school.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.760]   They go and they, because the government school
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.520]   can't discriminate, that means the government school
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.880]   can't discriminate against high schoolers
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.860]   if the state law allows for it, excuse me, homeschoolers.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.020]   And so they might do their homeschool,
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.580]   but then after every afternoon at 3.30,
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.880]   they're down on the basketball court
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.060]   playing basketball with a local basketball team
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.740]   or joining a musical theater or going to a computer class.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.300]   Many parents will use college classes for this.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.060]   And they enroll their teenagers
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.500]   into dual enrollment classes.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.700]   And they use that to get an experience
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.620]   of the classroom environment,
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.240]   but doing it in a more upper level
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.800]   and more controlled environment.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.400]   And they're doing it intentionally
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.440]   where it's something we're gonna invest
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.000]   five to 10 hours a week instead of five to 10 hours a day
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.860]   into that kind of inefficient environment.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.260]   Or this is just a good area where you say,
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:41.240]   my child's gifts are really well met
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.880]   by this particular school.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.120]   So I'm gonna enroll my children into this art school
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.560]   or into this school that has tremendous access, et cetera.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.440]   So I think I've covered most of the important objections.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.560]   I've also done my best to dismantle them,
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.320]   but to point out where they could be valid for most people.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.640]   But the practical stuff you have to solve yourself,
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.560]   the philosophical stuff,
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.360]   I think most of those objections are empty.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.960]   To me, actually, let me add one more.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.820]   And this actually is, I think, important.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.760]   I shared a few minutes ago why I was not,
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.820]   that I was homeschooled through seventh grade.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.360]   And you might be wondering why.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.760]   My parents enrolled us,
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   enrolled their children into a school
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   because they had seen homeschooling families
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.520]   that were excessively sheltered.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.880]   Because we're from kind of a Christian minority,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.560]   there are many people who homeschool
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.200]   not for the purposes of academic excellence,
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.800]   but primarily for the purposes of protecting their children
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.720]   from undesirable, immoral influences.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.560]   I think this is a powerful and appropriate reason
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.060]   to homeschool.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.520]   But the application of this at different ages can vary.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.480]   And so I think that what you do at the age of five,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.720]   in many cases, can and should be different
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.560]   than what you do at the age of 15.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.760]   And so my parents' concern was that they had known
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.520]   homeschooled children who were raised and were schooled
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.140]   and educated in a very protected environment.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.780]   But then they turned 18 and they went out
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.960]   and faced the world and there was no point of transition.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.420]   And in some cases, the children who were in that scenario
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.100]   were so shocked by what they encountered in the wider world
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.120]   and how different it was from their protected bubble
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   that they very quickly renounced the ideology
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.580]   with which they were raised and they embraced the ideology
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.540]   that was in the prevailing culture around them.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.180]   My parents didn't want that to happen.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.940]   So they wanted us to be non-sheltered
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:59.940]   at an early enough age where we would be able to work
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:05.860]   through the questions and the issues in a collaborative,
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.680]   consultative relationship with our parents as teens,
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.620]   rather than as late teens and early 20-somethings
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.380]   when it's less likely that a child would seek out
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.220]   his parents' advice on a continual basis.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.040]   For a time, they enrolled various of my older siblings
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.660]   into government schools, but this was at a period
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.660]   in the 1990s when the material that was being discussed
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:35.980]   in government schools was making a significant change.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:38.920]   And there was a point where one of my sisters
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.700]   who was in a kind of a highly rated magnet school,
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.140]   they were reviewing some of the books
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.380]   that she was going to be exposed to,
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.060]   and the books were quite simply pornographic.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.140]   And my parents said, "No, we're not going to require
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.180]   "our teenage daughter to read pornography in school."
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.740]   So they withdrew her from the government school
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.020]   and enrolled us into a local private Christian school,
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.060]   and that was the path that the rest of us went on.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.720]   It was a major strain financially.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.340]   It was the one time that my mom had a job
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.880]   outside of the house because my parents
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.540]   couldn't pay the tuition, except that she was able
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.780]   to get a job at the school, which gave her enough
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:15.220]   of a tuition discount that they were able to afford it.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.220]   But all of us as students contributed a nominal amount
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.140]   from our summer jobs to be able to make it work as a family.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.980]   And I would say that this is the reason not to homeschool
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.220]   that bothers me the most.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.520]   And the reason it bothers me the most is this.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   My parents had seven children.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.580]   One of my sisters is dead.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.780]   Seven children.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:41.780]   Of the six adult children, all of the six adult children
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:47.020]   continue to be faithful Christians.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.500]   I know quite a significant number of Christian families,
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.740]   and to have all of the children of Christian parents
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.020]   continue to be Christians as adults is very unusual.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.520]   Now, I think there are a couple of aspects of that.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.780]   Number one, the faith of my parents and the environment
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.340]   that we were raised in built a tremendous level of respect
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.700]   from us children to our parents.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:16.700]   And so that respect was a consistent thing.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.340]   And so I wouldn't say that school was a causal factor,
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.900]   but it does remain the case that this was a big concern
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.380]   for my parents, that they didn't want us
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.660]   to be excessively sheltered.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.100]   And so they intentionally exposed us to,
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.860]   in a still somewhat sheltered way,
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.220]   but they intentionally exposed us
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.780]   to these challenges of the world.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.220]   And that does seem to have had a good influence,
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.740]   at least by that testimony.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.620]   So this is the thing that actually bothers me the most
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.940]   as a homeschooling parent,
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.040]   is that because of that experience that I had,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:56.260]   I often wonder, will I do the same thing?
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.100]   Will I enroll my children into a school when they're older?
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.460]   I believe that five-year-olds
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.080]   should be exceedingly well-sheltered
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.580]   10-year-olds should be pretty very much well-sheltered.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.540]   15-year-olds need to be significantly unsheltered
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:16.100]   in order to progress healthily into adulthood.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:22.140]   I have often gotten frustrated at what could have been.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.460]   And when I think about the massive waste of time
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.640]   that was my high school experience
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.700]   compared to what I could have done
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.500]   in terms of academic accomplishment,
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.860]   in terms of business building,
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.920]   in terms of career building, et cetera,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.940]   sometimes I get frustrated with that.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.060]   But in hindsight, I have to look back and say,
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.520]   I'm sure I learned more lessons from that environment
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.660]   than I give credit to.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.820]   And the reason I wanted to raise that objection,
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.020]   number one, it's real, but it's also an important thing
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.320]   that in schooling as a parent,
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.540]   I don't believe the right way to approach things
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.940]   is from an ideological perspective first and foremost.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:00.980]   As parents, our responsibility is to raise and parent
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.060]   this specific child at this specific point in time.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.300]   And that may look different as the years go by.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.340]   And so we should inform ourselves
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.620]   about various ideologies and approaches, et cetera.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.520]   We should listen to strong and robust defenders
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.500]   of those ideologies.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.840]   That's why I try my best to defend as robustly
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.860]   as I'm able to my perspective.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.820]   But at the end of the day, we have a responsibility
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.380]   to filter those things down and look at this child,
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.780]   this boy, this girl, this young man, this young woman,
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:37.040]   and then say, what is best for this young man
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.660]   and this young woman at this point in time?
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.420]   And that may be one thing at the age of three.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.520]   It will be a different thing at the age of eight,
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.340]   and it will be a different thing at the age of 13.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.820]   And I think that it's perfectly acceptable
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.980]   to go in and out and among these systems
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.200]   as you, the parent, decide is best.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.220]   For example, I mentioned that I was,
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.380]   I went to a government school in third grade.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.220]   Well, the reason I went to a government school
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.940]   in third grade was because my 14-year-old sister died
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.780]   from an epileptic seizure.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:12.940]   And working their way through that in our family,
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.820]   I don't think my parents, my parents decided that,
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.860]   you know what, homeschooling this year is not for us.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.500]   And so they enrolled us, or they enrolled me,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.700]   I don't really remember everyone else,
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.620]   but I think no one was homeschooling during that year.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.740]   But then after one year of homeschooling,
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:30.780]   then our family was in a stronger place,
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.100]   able to press forward.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:37.100]   And so they started homeschooling again.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.760]   And along the way, sometimes my mom homeschooled me,
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.920]   sometimes my grandmother homeschooled me,
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.340]   sometimes the work was good, sometimes the work was bad.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.460]   Sometimes the academic achievement was high,
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.740]   sometimes the academic achievement was low.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.500]   Sometimes motivation and the good,
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.340]   it was a good environment,
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   sometimes there was less of a good environment.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.780]   And when I use that term, I just mean in terms of,
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.500]   you know, academic structure and friends and such.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:06.500]   So as a parent, what I want to emphasize
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   is that it's our responsibility not to be slaves
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.780]   to an ideology, but to be good parents
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:17.140]   and to study what is right for this child
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.700]   at this point in time.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.980]   I defend homeschooling quite robustly
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.700]   because I believe it's a wonderful solution
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.700]   and really brings many opportunities and possibilities
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:34.280]   that are not available otherwise.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:38.620]   The modern industrial factory school system
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.620]   is failing our students on every single metric.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.820]   There is a very small minority that escape intact
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.300]   and that succeed in that system
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.600]   because of academic skills, academic prowess,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.780]   internal self-motivation, et cetera.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.020]   There is a very small minority
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.540]   that is saved by that system, right?
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.380]   This is where you get into another objection
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.460]   to homeschooling that some people raise is,
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.420]   well, how do we control for abusive environments, right?
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.180]   You find parental neglect, childhood neglect,
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.700]   child abuse happening, and sometimes homeschooling
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.980]   can conceal that because my child doesn't have to go
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.820]   to a school where the teacher's a mandated reporter
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.580]   about the bruises that my child has and things like that.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.880]   And those things are true,
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.680]   but they're statistically unimportant, right?
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.620]   And that's more, I don't think we should invent
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:33.620]   this giant system to account for those horrific crimes.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.080]   But that is a concern that some people have
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.960]   about homeschooling broadly.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.380]   The key thing is that just simply
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.840]   the modern industrial school system
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.880]   was never developed and built with the primary intention
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.680]   of educating a child effectively and well.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.200]   The modern industrial school system was designed and built
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.660]   with the goal of creating a uniform population
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.980]   that would be easily governed and easily controlled
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:04.980]   and by giving that population a certain way of thinking,
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.740]   a certain mindset, a certain worldview.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.140]   And you feel free to go down as deep
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.660]   as that rabbit hole as you want, right?
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.100]   John Taylor Gatto's "Underground History
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.940]   of American Education" is good.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.380]   "Crimes of the Educators" is good.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.040]   You can kind of go down that rabbit
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.520]   or you can just go to the philosophical perspective.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.020]   Go read John Dewey's writings
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.720]   and the progressive school system era
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.860]   in the mid 20th century.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.480]   The point is that the school system was never developed
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.400]   to help your child succeed to his or her maximal ability.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.220]   That's why the elites have always had a secondary system.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.260]   There are great schools out there that are accessed
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.040]   by the elites of our country and every country in the world.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.000]   It's not your local government school.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.760]   And so if you are actually looking
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.240]   for a personalized solution to your child's success,
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.360]   which is what we as parents want,
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.400]   then we need to be aware of the opportunities
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   that are available to us and then go and seek out the thing
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.960]   that is gonna be the best for this child's success.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.480]   And we should want more and desire more from our schools
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.200]   than them to serve as babysitters
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.240]   so that we can put more people in the workforce
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   so we can have the income
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.720]   so we can boost corporate profits.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.120]   I want my children to be well-educated
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.240]   and I wanna use whatever tools are at my capacity to do it.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.200]   And as a parent, just like almost all parents,
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.280]   this is our primary goal.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.500]   We want our children to go beyond us.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.040]   And in our current day,
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.900]   especially in a post-information age society,
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.420]   we know that education is core
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.960]   and the industrial factory school system
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.600]   that can be defeated with our children using chat GPT
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.440]   to write their essays is not a school system
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.640]   that's going to prepare them to function in a world
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.300]   in which chat GPT is taking their jobs.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:07.200]   And so I'm more concerned about building the skills
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.480]   so that chat GPT is a tool and not a threat
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.960]   'cause it's not going away.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.180]   And the entire industrial factory school system
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:18.540]   is antiquated and out of touch.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.940]   About the only thing it does well is give children
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:25.140]   a, I can't say safe environment,
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.340]   some gives them a supervised environment on a daily basis
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.700]   so mom and dad can go to work.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.340]   And that just sucks in my opinion and we ought to do better.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:38.340]   So one hour podcast on that for you, Ben.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.220]   But hopefully that gives you a little bit to think about.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.840]   - I got a little bit more than I bargained for there.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.520]   I appreciate it, yeah, it definitely does.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.520]   Yeah, no, I appreciate the time, thank you.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.380]   - That's a good place to move on from there.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:54.560]   Let's go to Bradley in California.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.720]   Bradley, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.480]   You muted yourself again, let me unmute you, Bradley.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.440]   Bradley, are you ready to go?
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.680]   Go ahead.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.520]   - I'm here.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.340]   - Go ahead.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.960]   - So I got a sleeping newborn in my arms
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.640]   so we'll see how many questions I get through.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.240]   - Absolutely.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.860]   - But my first question was, a couple of years back,
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.380]   I had subscribed to an email newsletter of yours
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:16.220]   and you had 12, both recommendations for 12 months
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.940]   and I'm trying to put together
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.180]   kind of my reading list for this year.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.900]   And I was wondering if you had any newer recommendations
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.860]   that you could put out for this year?
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.300]   - That's a great question.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.660]   And I would love to answer it.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.660]   So now for a limited time until I'm on motorsports,
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:40.580]   get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.800]   on select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.460]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:49.900]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.080]   you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.720]   to a championship winner.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.820]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.420]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.100]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.840]   Let me give you, let me just give you a couple or three
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.460]   that I have really enjoyed and benefited from lately.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:17.920]   The book that has probably really impacted me significantly
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.920]   this last year is called "Stolen Focus."
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.680]   And let me find the subtitle here.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.560]   Okay, it's called "Stolen Focus,
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.040]   Why You Can't Pay Attention and How to Think Deeply Again"
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.880]   by Johan Hari, "Stolen Focus, Why You Can't Pay Attention
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.440]   and How to Think Deeply Again."
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.680]   This book is so good that I had planned,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.520]   I didn't do it yet, but I was gonna do a standalone
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.440]   kind of summary podcast of it,
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.760]   but I just thought it was really, really wonderful.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.120]   In that book, Hari talks about the problem
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.520]   of our modern inability to focus,
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.800]   and then talks about potential solutions to it.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.200]   And I really appreciated his approach
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.760]   because he didn't limit himself
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.880]   to kind of stereotypical cheap answers, right?
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.380]   Well, turn off notifications on your phone.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.800]   That's good, that's useful, but it's much more than that.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   And it has really, it really opened my eyes
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.920]   to kind of the immensity of the problem
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.920]   and the immensity of the problem,
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.280]   and I guess I can't go any farther.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.920]   It was a really, really good book.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.640]   A second book that's related to that is,
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.040]   I went and I reread, in light of that,
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.600]   Cal Newport's book, "Deep Work."
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.680]   And "Deep Work" is called, the subtitle is,
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   "Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World."
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.200]   And this book is kind of the solution to it,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.500]   but one of the things that I appreciated,
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.840]   let me look and find, I wanna find a quick quote from it,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.920]   from the beginning of the book while I'm talking.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.000]   This book basically talks about the usefulness
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   of doing deep work, but here is the hypothesis,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.280]   right from the introduction, and it says this.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.160]   The deep work hypothesis.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.260]   The ability to perform deep work
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.000]   is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.680]   As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.680]   and then make it the core of their working life will thrive.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.360]   I wanna reread that.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.000]   Listen to this, the deep work hypothesis,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.960]   and let me define deep work.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.480]   Deep work means that you sit down
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:48.120]   and you focus single-mindedly on an important work task,
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.120]   an important project, et cetera,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.360]   and you eliminate from yourself distractions
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.560]   and a distractible environment
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.720]   in order that you can spend significant amounts
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.600]   of intellectual capital on that project.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.120]   So again, the deep work hypothesis.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.400]   The ability to perform deep work
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.920]   is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.840]   it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.760]   As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   and then make it the core of their working life will thrive.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:28.560]   And even related to education
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   of my long monologue that I just finished,
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.160]   to me, this is actually one of the other big benefits
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.920]   and things that I'm working hard to focus on
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.760]   in our homeschool environment
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   is the importance of staying very focused on a task
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.080]   with no distractions.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.160]   And I look around and I don't like to be
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.500]   the kind of the old fogey who talks about kids these days.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.920]   That's a natural generational thing
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.960]   that has approached.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   But I do mourn for most of our environment,
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.000]   most of our culture, and mourn for especially
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.800]   most of our youth, the ability that we need
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.680]   and that we have to do deep and important work.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.960]   And I noticed this with myself,
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.800]   which is I'm my own guinea pig.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.440]   I remember when I was younger,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.800]   how good I was at staying focused
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.240]   for very long periods of time.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.640]   And then I remembered how that changed.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.080]   And when that changed, I understood that I saw the change.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.080]   And so because of that, I was able to notice
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:41.320]   how my ability to focus was declining.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.720]   Then when I noticed it, I worked really hard
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.240]   on getting it back.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.120]   And I've made significant progress
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.740]   in getting back my ability to focus,
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.040]   which has been really, really useful to me.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.880]   And then now, thankfully, a friend of mine
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.920]   just sent me this week, published January 3rd,
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.360]   we're getting some data on this.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.400]   Let me read you this headline.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.080]   This is from, I'm reading from
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.840]   the University of North Carolina, unc.edu.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.960]   One of their research from their news
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.880]   and updates department says, quote,
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.240]   "Study shows habitual checking of social media
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.160]   "may impact young adolescents' brain development.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.060]   "The study provides some of the first findings
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:21.280]   "on how social media usage could have longstanding
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.280]   "and important consequences on the development
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.700]   "of adolescent brains by the College of Arts and Sciences,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.880]   "Tuesday, January 3, 2023."
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.000]   And I'll just read the first few paragraphs.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.920]   In one of the first long-term studies
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.320]   on adolescent neural development and technology use,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.200]   researchers at the University of North Carolina
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.280]   at Chapel Hill report adolescents'
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   habitual checking of social media
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.040]   is linked with subsequent changes
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.760]   in how their brains respond to the world around them.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.380]   The study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics,
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.300]   reveals that adolescents' brains may become more sensitive
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:56.660]   when anticipating social rewards and punishments over time
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:59.140]   with increased social media usage.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.720]   Quote, "The findings suggest that children
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.080]   "who grow up checking social media more often
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.820]   "are becoming hypersensitive to feedback from their peers,"
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.900]   said Eva Telzer, a professor in UNC Chapel Hill's
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.860]   Psychology and Neuroscience Department
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.740]   and a corresponding author.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.980]   And so, you know, they go through it.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:20.420]   We're just starting, we're at the starting point
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.860]   of getting data and good, decent studies
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.300]   on some of the impact of this.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:29.300]   But I am convinced that Cal Newport's hypothesis is correct.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.820]   And I see this as kind of a huge danger.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.720]   I mentioned just a few minutes ago, CHAT-GPT,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.900]   which has, of course, taken over the world by storm
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.260]   over the last month.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.700]   And I look at CHAT-GPT, and I think it's important
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.260]   not to have the perspective of a Luddite,
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.220]   just saying that all new technology is bad.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.460]   At every stage in human history,
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:54.460]   when we invented new technologies to solve a problem
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:27:00.700]   and eliminate human labor, there was a major societal fear
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.060]   that, well, this just means people are gonna be out of work,
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.180]   going back to everything from an elevator,
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.380]   the Bellman operating the elevator,
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.220]   to people operating the elevator themselves,
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.460]   to the printing press, to almost anything.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.380]   At every stage, we go through this perspective
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.580]   where we take away jobs, et cetera.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.140]   But when we come back from it,
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.620]   we wind up using those technologies,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.140]   generally, to improve things.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.540]   And so I'm very optimistic about new technologies.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.660]   And while it's probably not quite right to call it AI,
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:33.640]   the current use of AI technology
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.140]   is going to dramatically improve our world
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.320]   in many ways that we can't predict yet.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.120]   But what it requires is that we upgrade our skills.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.460]   So the teacher who can be replaced by AI,
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:50.740]   or the student whose work can be replaced by AI
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.220]   has a problem, he has to upgrade his skills.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.460]   And the most important skill that we have as humans
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.580]   is our creativity and our focus
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:01.220]   and our ability to imagine new things.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:05.320]   And so that's been a big deal for me,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.580]   thinking a lot about that.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:10.340]   And I want, even from an educational perspective,
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.660]   if I were elected emperor of the world,
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:18.660]   I would spend a lot of time creating environments of focus
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:22.260]   for children to be in.
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.580]   Now, those environments of focus for children, of course,
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.340]   will be different than for adults.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:30.860]   When I want to encourage focused work,
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.100]   we want to focus on the work, 15 minutes,
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.220]   focus, then be done.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.300]   And we want to have lots of unstructured playtime
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:37.880]   of no focus.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.640]   The goal is not to take a 10-year-old
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.540]   and put him into an environment
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.380]   where 10 hours a day is doing deep work,
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.940]   but we need to build our muscles in that perspective.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.300]   And that to me is really important.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.620]   So those would be just two that I would suggest
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.440]   off the top of my head.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.460]   Let me make one more, actually, which is interesting,
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:55.700]   'cause you didn't give me any guidelines.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:00.700]   I have really been enjoying the book, "Making Numbers Count,
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.440]   "The Art and Science of Communicating Numbers,"
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.060]   by Chip Heath and Carla Starr.
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.200]   Chip Heath wrote the book, "Switch" and "Made to Stick."
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.760]   And this is a book that a friend of mine told me about it,
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.720]   and I went and picked up a copy.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.360]   And it affirms with good examples
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.400]   kind of what I have often noticed in financial planning
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.480]   is quite simply that the human brain is not well adapted
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.440]   to conceive of numbers.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.200]   And so the entire book gives instructions and tools
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.160]   for basically translating everything
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.920]   into user-friendly numbers,
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.640]   translating things into context where they make more sense.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.980]   And this happens in many areas.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.520]   Let me give you a couple of interesting examples
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.840]   just from the beginning of it, right?
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:49.520]   So this is the numeric expression.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.480]   97.5% of the world's water is salinated.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.240]   Of the 2.5% that's fresh,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.080]   over 99% is trapped in glaciers and snowfields.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.920]   In total, only 0.025% of the water on the globe
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.160]   is actually drinkable by humans and animals.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.920]   So that's a compelling statistic,
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.560]   but it's hard to remember.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.840]   So here is the rewrite of it.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.080]   Imagine a gallon jug filled with water
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.320]   with three ice cubes next to it.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:16.160]   All of the water in the jug is saltwater.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.520]   The ice cubes are the only freshwater,
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.080]   and humans can only drink the drops
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.520]   that are melting off of each.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.840]   And so it takes the same numbers
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.280]   but puts them into a human scale.
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.600]   And they give example after example
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.800]   after example out of it.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.560]   So this is something that I'm studying
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.680]   'cause I wanna do a better job of making numbers make sense.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.560]   And so I'm trying to learn the lessons
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.160]   and then figure out how to apply them.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.160]   So much of my work is extemporaneous,
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.240]   and so I struggle with that.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.060]   But I wanna do a better job of making numbers count
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.280]   so that they make sense for people.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.240]   So there are three books to consider.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.160]   - Yeah, no, those would be great.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.640]   I love Cal Newport.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.280]   I'm familiar with Deep Work,
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.680]   but I haven't read Stolen Focus,
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.520]   so I'll definitely check that one out as well.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.200]   And just since you have interest there,
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.560]   another one to put on your radar
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.600]   might be Indistractable by Nir Eyal,
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.040]   if you haven't checked that one out.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.880]   And I definitely haven't heard of the Making Numbers Count.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.000]   So much appreciated.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.440]   I will challenge you 'cause I have a long year ahead of me.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.840]   If you have interest in it,
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.440]   to put out a full reading list
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.360]   'cause I got 12 months of reading to fill.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.560]   You've done a good job of effectively persuading me
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.400]   the benefits of reading.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.760]   And actually, I should thank you for that
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.920]   'cause I spent more time reading
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.720]   in the last year or so than I ever have,
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.360]   and you're largely to thank for that.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.760]   And actually, it's funny you mentioned Cal Newport
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:33.680]   because I always think of him
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.160]   when I think of you and your show
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.680]   because whenever someone's looking for career advice
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.920]   or looking to make a career change,
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.840]   his book on So Good They Can't Ignore You
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.800]   and Your Career and Income Course
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:50.560]   are my two most popular resources to refer people to
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.400]   in terms of thinking through those decisions.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.480]   So I put you in the same league as him in that regard
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.920]   for advice there.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.160]   My second question regarding
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.400]   kind of just a plan for spending.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.920]   Every year, I create an annual budget
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.880]   and I'm trying to do the same for this year.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.480]   I've been at a point where I've been saving
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.040]   and investing about 40 to 50% of my pre-tax income.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.680]   And I really don't have much interest
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.680]   or see too much marginal benefit in going beyond that.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.920]   So instead of focusing on being more frugal this year
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.760]   or investing more,
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.840]   I really wanna figure out areas where I can spend more
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.120]   for the most return on my personal happiness,
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.360]   my family's happiness and spending more.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.560]   Not a big amount that I have to add here
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.960]   somewhere around 10 to 15,000 disposable income to do that.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.640]   But I was wondering what broad categories
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.120]   should I be looking at?
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.200]   I had a few in my mind,
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.120]   but I'm sure there's things I'm not thinking of
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.680]   because I've kind of been in this really frugal mindset
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.160]   of just going at it full throttle
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.920]   for the last four or five years now.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.360]   - Love it.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.920]   I should probably devote an entire,
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.080]   see, probably a series of podcasts to that
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.480]   because it's such a powerful way to think.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.200]   Years ago, I did a show on budgeting
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.840]   and one of the points that I made in that budgeting show
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.800]   was the importance of identifying
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.600]   whether certain categories in your budget should increase,
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.400]   stay the same or decrease.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.440]   When you look at your budget,
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.560]   spending less money is not the goal,
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.800]   but rather there should be an additional texture
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.640]   to say which categories of spending
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.360]   would I like to spend more money on,
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.680]   which categories of spending
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.880]   would I like to spend about the same
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.400]   or in which categories would I like to spend less money on?
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:48.320]   And a lot of this comes down to personal values, et cetera.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.320]   So what I would do is let me use my three question,
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.120]   let me riff off of my three question
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.520]   to give you a framework for this three question idea.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:01.640]   So remember, I've done shows on the three questions
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.280]   that are prior to financial planning.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.960]   Question number one is, who do you live with?
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.960]   Question number two is, where do you live?
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.000]   And question number three is, what do you do for work?
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.120]   The idea being that if you live with people that you love
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.320]   and you love who you live with,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.840]   you can live a happy life
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.280]   regardless of your financial abundance or scarcity.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.280]   Secondly, if you live in a place that you love
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.560]   and you just really enjoy that,
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.840]   that's gonna drive everything about your life experience.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.320]   And so choosing a place that you love
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.400]   at the macro level, country level, climate level,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.320]   down to even just the specific house is a big deal.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.760]   And then number three is what you do for work.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.360]   And so I think that those are three categories
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.960]   that then would give you the insight
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.040]   into what specific areas of expenses
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.880]   do you want to focus on.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.280]   And so like a house, for example,
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.240]   we can go the other way.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.880]   Well, actually, let me take it in this direction.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.400]   I'll split the order
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.000]   because it'll make, I think, the explanation simpler.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.560]   So on your house, spending money on your house,
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.920]   I think one of the best areas
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   where you can increase your expenses
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.720]   is often on your living environment.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720]   Anything that you can do
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.360]   to make your living environment more pleasurable
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.480]   for you based upon your specific scenario
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.240]   is a good thing.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.520]   Sometimes this means changing houses.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.360]   And so if there's a big structural change
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.160]   that can be accomplished,
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.240]   when I lived, I think it was four tenths of a,
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.080]   two fifths of a mile,
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.080]   less than half a mile from my office,
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.180]   it was what a wonderful structural change.
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:35.440]   To eliminate commuting, I didn't work in the house,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.640]   but to eliminate commuting
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:39.560]   was one of the best structural changes to my life.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.600]   In that particular house,
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.740]   when I was so close to my office,
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.400]   that house, I had a grocery store
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.880]   that was a 10 minute walk away
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.520]   and about a five minute bike ride.
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.800]   We had a library that was a 10 minute walk
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.200]   and a five minute bike ride.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.560]   We had a wonderful park that was a five minute walk
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.400]   and a five minute bike ride.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.720]   And so like having all of those amenities
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.680]   and not having to get into a car to drive everywhere
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.760]   is just a major lifestyle improvement.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.580]   So sometimes changing the location of your house
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.200]   can be a smart thing to do.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.320]   And if it costs you an extra $10,000 a year
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.600]   in interest payments,
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.600]   that might be a great thing to do.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.320]   Then in terms of the specifics of your house,
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.960]   a lot of times, you know, you said,
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.560]   I got this frugal house, but you know,
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.560]   here we are now, we need to home,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.720]   we wanna homeschool, but we don't have a homeschool room.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.120]   Well, spend $15,000 and add a homeschool room to your house
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.000]   or spend $50,000 and add a homeschool room to your house
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.040]   and just cover it out of your annual mortgage expenses.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.380]   Things like that, that give you the ability
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.300]   to live the kind of lifestyle that you want
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.460]   will be good investments.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.100]   And in addition, spending on your house
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.300]   in terms of amenities.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.940]   So whether it's taking out an interior wall
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.200]   and expanding the dining room
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.040]   so you can have bigger dinner parties
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.780]   or putting an extra window in
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:56.220]   so that you can have more light
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.420]   and feel like you are in a better situation
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.580]   or upgrading the kitchen
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:03.540]   so it's a useful, functional place to be.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.940]   These are, this is good money spent
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.060]   because your house provides one of the basic bones
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.980]   of your life and it's really, really useful.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.660]   I personally think that as men,
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.080]   we often discount the importance of this.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.320]   I did myself when I was younger.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.480]   And my wife would talk about
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.800]   wanting to do something on the house
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.840]   and I'm like, "No, let's be frugal."
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.300]   And then one day I just realized,
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.420]   her situation is unique, but I woke up and I said,
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.060]   "You know what, Joshua, you're being dumb, right?
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:34.160]   "All of my wife's life is either in the house
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.900]   "that we live in or out of the house that we live in."
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:41.540]   So as a mother, and a full-time mother
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.960]   and a homeschooling mother, et cetera,
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.780]   she's always either in the house
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.900]   or working out from the house.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:52.100]   And so her ministry to her children is in the house.
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.900]   She's in the house a lot.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.500]   Her ministry to others is in the home, right?
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.140]   Opening up our home, bringing in guests, et cetera.
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.540]   And so money that I spend on our home
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:06.000]   is in a very, very important expenditure for her.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.460]   That's different than me, right?
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.080]   Much of my life is outside of the house.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.600]   I'm probably at home for more than most men,
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.680]   but still, when I go out for work,
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.320]   I work outside of the house.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.620]   When I go out for play, I often play outside of the house.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.800]   When I go out and do work in the community,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.520]   it's generally outside of the house.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.040]   And so as a man, it's easy to underestimate
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.120]   the importance of the house and the home for my wife,
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.700]   because we have different roles.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.240]   We have different functions.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.720]   And so I think that spending money on the house
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.760]   is a wonderful thing to do.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.280]   And it has the side benefit that in some cases--
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.840]   not all cases, but in some cases--
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.820]   it can result in a financial increase when it
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:50.440]   comes time to sell the house.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.280]   The second thing that can really be a great expenditure of money
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.300]   is on your career, on increasing the pleasure
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.080]   that you gain from your career.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.600]   I talk a lot about increasing the amount of money
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.520]   that you gain from your career.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.480]   But I think spending money on your career
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.400]   to increase the pleasure of the career
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.680]   is a really good thing to do.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.120]   And there are many levels at which you can do that.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   So first, recognize that most of what we do in life is optional.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.520]   And if we intentionally, consciously choose
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.280]   to do more of the things that we want to do,
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.780]   more of the things that give us energy, more of the things
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.180]   that invigorate us, and we intentionally
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.560]   choose to do fewer of the things that drain us,
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.240]   the things that we're not well-suited for,
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.200]   the things we don't like doing, the things that
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   make us feel frustrated and angry, et cetera,
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.680]   we're increasing the quality of our life.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.400]   And sometimes all that's needed is to spend $10,000 or $15,000
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.760]   and make that happen.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.880]   And so it might be you spending $10,000 or $15,000
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.620]   to hire a personal assistant.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.900]   Sometimes it's spending $10,000 or $15,000
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.940]   to upgrade the tools of your life.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.360]   Sometimes it's spending $10,000 or $15,000
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.620]   on decreasing your salary by going to your boss
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.400]   and saying, boss, I don't want to do these things anymore,
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.280]   and swapping it out.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.360]   Sometimes it's spending $10,000 or $15,000
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:10.940]   on flying business class instead of economy class,
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.960]   or whatever the actual application is.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.520]   The question I ask is, can I spend more money on my career
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.960]   in order to improve the emotional juice
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.440]   and the emotional satisfaction that I get from my career?
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:27.040]   Because this is easier for an entrepreneur.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.420]   If I'm coaching an entrepreneur, I coach the entrepreneur,
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.520]   and I say, the goal is to spend all of your time on things
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.760]   that fascinate you and motivate you,
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.640]   to steal Dan Sullivan's nomenclature.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.560]   Fascinate me and motivate me.
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:42.840]   I want to do those things that fascinate me and motivate me.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.720]   And then I want to get rid of everything else.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.720]   But you can do that to a significant degree
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.120]   as an employee as well.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.760]   And a lot of times, if you say, how can I
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   spend the money on that, then it's good.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.680]   And that's a different spin than what I talk about
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.200]   with increasing income.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.280]   If it's increasing income, certainly spending money
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.160]   on a coach, spending money on an advisor,
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.720]   spending money on those things is really productive.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.760]   But could you spend money on increasing
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.560]   the quality of your career?
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.960]   And then finally, I think just broadly speaking,
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.160]   spending money on relationships.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.360]   I am convinced that perhaps the best way
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.320]   to spend money where you get maximum bang for buck
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.800]   is on people and on relationships.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.520]   And we know that.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.680]   We talk about that commonly.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.440]   We say, spend money on experiences, not stuff.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:29.000]   But I focus specifically on relationships.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.320]   And I take this from my Christian ideology.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.640]   Jesus said, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.000]   where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.920]   and steal.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.000]   But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.080]   where moth and rust do not destroy
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.880]   and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.840]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.400]   And that, as a financial planner,
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.120]   I spent years thinking about that.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.720]   And I struggled with it, because there
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.480]   seems to be this intentional--
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.960]   there is this clear conundrum, at the very least,
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.800]   whether it's just conflict or conundrum.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.080]   I don't like to go to--
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.400]   I prefer paradox or conundrum or seeming disconnect
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.040]   between working as a financial planner,
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.560]   teaching people how to pile up money on earth,
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.360]   versus what Jesus said.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:19.760]   And some people, many good-hearted Christians,
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.080]   believe that what Jesus was teaching
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.080]   was to be taken in a literal fashion.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.800]   There are many Christians who consciously and intentionally
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.800]   choose not to accumulate money because of Jesus' teachings
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.520]   there.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.400]   The hard thing for me was always working in an American context,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.280]   where money flows like water.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.120]   There's just money around everywhere,
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.500]   just flying through the gutters.
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.760]   And all you got to do is just stoop down and pick some
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.600]   and do some work.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.340]   And you got more money than you can spend
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:51.880]   if you just follow some basic principles.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.000]   And so I thought, well, it seems irresponsible
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.520]   not to pile up money.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:00.280]   But what brought me a lot of joy and clarity
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.160]   was when I thought about how I would actually
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.320]   lay up treasures in heaven.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.600]   And sometimes Christians take this
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.560]   in the sense of winning souls.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.120]   So they say, the way that you lay up treasures in heaven
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.280]   is to go and to preach the gospel
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.640]   and to go and encourage people to be born again
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.560]   and help to usher them into the kingdom by being born again.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.800]   I think that's absolutely true.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.140]   But I like to look at it just more broadly.
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.160]   If I think about what is in heaven, which is exclusively
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.680]   souls, that's what's in heaven, then to me,
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.280]   if I can spend money on people, then that
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.920]   seems really, really appropriate.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.960]   And so the way that I lay up treasures on heaven
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.520]   is by spending money on people.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.960]   And then the specific application of that
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.360]   will come differently in my life and in my lifestyle over time.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.880]   So one application of it is my wife and I
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.240]   are expecting our fifth child.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.520]   Well, they're not cheap.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.700]   They're not as expensive as all the studies say,
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.040]   but they're still not cheap.
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.580]   But I'm laying up treasures in heaven
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:06.780]   because the one thing I can take with me into heaven
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:08.720]   is souls, the souls of those I impact
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.540]   and the souls of my children who I can
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.440]   impact more than anybody else.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.240]   And so I want to have a large family.
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.640]   And if it costs you another $10,000 or $15,000 a year
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.640]   to have a large family or to homeschool or something
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.600]   like that, I think those are good categories
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.520]   to spend money on.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.520]   But I think it goes much beyond that.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.720]   And so some of it would involve charitable giving.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.400]   If I notice that my neighbor is in need
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.280]   and I have the ability to give more money to my neighbor
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.120]   to help him in his time of need, then that's
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:36.280]   something that I should do.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:40.080]   And I'll gain a great deal of joy out of that.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.080]   And then it can go beyond that, though.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.160]   I think a big thing that we can do is
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.080]   we can create special experiences with other people.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.080]   And sometimes all that's needed is
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.960]   to have a sum of money that we're willing to spend on it.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.340]   And so if it means setting up a dinner date with your friends
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.840]   and you're going out with you and your wife on a double date,
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.600]   and then all of a sudden, the last minute,
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.880]   you swap from the frugal spot that's
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.880]   kind of the normal boring spot--
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.080]   I don't know, Chili's or some boring place that
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.040]   would have just been a humdrum experience--
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.840]   and all of a sudden, you put on a black tie
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.600]   and you go to the fancy steakhouse and you go to a show.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.200]   Well, those are the memories that
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.720]   are going to pervade in life.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.840]   And a lot of times, this has double benefit.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:27.480]   First, people say, well, spend money on memories
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.600]   rather than on possessions.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.800]   But they don't tell you how to spend money on memories.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.120]   And the way I think you do this, just from my thinking about it,
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:41.720]   is simply that you spend money on making situations that are
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.360]   out of the normal situations.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:53.960]   So if I ask you what you had for dinner last week Thursday,
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.160]   you're not going to remember.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.800]   But if I ask you what you ate at neighbor Ted's barbecue
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.000]   last Saturday, then you can immediately
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.440]   remember it because you have a hook to hang it
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.800]   onto in your thinking.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.560]   You remember, oh, neighbor Ted's barbecue.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.320]   I had barbecue ribs, and I ate ribs and baked beans and corn.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.920]   And so you can come up with something
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.520]   because of the differentiation, the distinction from day to day.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.760]   And this distinction is really, really important to creating
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.680]   a life that you can remember.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.320]   Distinction doesn't always require money to be spent.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.400]   But what distinction does require
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.320]   is thoughtfulness into creating something that is
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.720]   different than the normal life.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.280]   I started thinking about this, I guess, a decade ago
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.800]   when I started thinking about holidays.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.000]   There's this interesting-- so I've never
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.320]   been a big holiday guy.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.160]   I didn't celebrate a lot of holidays when I was growing up.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.040]   And then I started to have children.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.680]   And as I started to think about children
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:51.200]   and what I was going to do, I started
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.680]   thinking about holidays.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:56.600]   In the Old Testament, God establishes for the people,
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.840]   the children of Israel, He establishes certain holidays.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.840]   And He says, keep these holidays.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.240]   And if you look at why, He says, so that you will remember.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.640]   Keep these holidays so that you will remember.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:14.240]   The holidays were all instituted to memorialize
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:17.080]   a specific happening, a specific example, right?
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:22.480]   God's-- the Passover or other events in the Exodus.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.960]   And so I came to the point that the point of holidays
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.120]   is so that you will remember something.
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.800]   So come to our modern secular holidays, right?
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.480]   Why do we have Memorial Day, right?
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.640]   Well, it's supposed to be so that you will remember.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.980]   Why do we have Thanksgiving Day?
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.720]   So that you will remember.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.920]   And so the distinction of a holiday,
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.280]   the thing that makes a holiday different than a non-holiday,
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.920]   is that our activities are different
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.640]   and our actions are different.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:54.280]   So we can design a lifestyle where
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.800]   we can either go through life and live a very humdrum
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.200]   existence, where day to day, week to week, month to month,
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.760]   year to year, there's very little distinction.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:09.040]   There's very little-- there are few things to remember.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.800]   And then when we look back over the years,
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.040]   we can't see any texture to the past.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.840]   And that's not very fulfilling.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:17.840]   And if you compare that to building texture
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.920]   into your life, where you go through a day
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.640]   and you do something special on a certain day, right?
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.320]   It's a Thursday night.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.080]   But today on Thursday night, we get out to find China
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.400]   and we light the candles and we all put on our best suits
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.240]   and ties and our fanciest dresses
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.120]   and we sit down for dinner at Thursday night.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.080]   That's memorable.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:40.320]   Or on Tuesday night, instead of coming home
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.960]   to a same old, same old dinner table experience,
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.880]   we light a fire in the backyard and we go
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.880]   and we cook our food on the fire.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:47.760]   That's memorable.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.520]   And all of a sudden, you go through life.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.960]   And if you're intentional about it,
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.440]   we can build these experiences day by day by day,
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.120]   week by week, month by month.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.400]   And those things are the things that we treasure.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:00.280]   And then back to the money, I think that one of the things
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.880]   that we can and should do with money
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.680]   is work to bring people into that kind of lifestyle.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.720]   That sometimes you can spend money on people
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.920]   and you can craft a beautiful experience.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.960]   You can craft a memorable event.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.920]   You can craft something that they're going to appreciate.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.680]   And that's when they look back on the past year,
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.320]   they're going to, those events can be significant.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.000]   They don't always need to cost money.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.880]   And in fact, I think that some of the most interesting ones
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.960]   are actually the ones that don't cost money.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:32.920]   They just cost time and thinking.
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.360]   In the American context where money is so abundant,
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.880]   a lot of times what we can do
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:43.360]   to make an experience memorable
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.760]   is consciously not spend money.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.400]   Because we're so used to just spending money,
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.240]   spending money.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.880]   And if you institute the constraint of not spending money,
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.520]   you have a much more interesting experience.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.480]   A short story, years ago,
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.160]   one of the most memorable dates
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.960]   that I ever had with my wife
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.280]   was a date in which we spent almost no money.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.320]   And I can't remember why,
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.280]   I was somewhat broke at the time
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.120]   and I just spent a bunch of money.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:11.960]   I didn't have a lot of money.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.680]   It was actually Valentine's Day.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.680]   And we came home from a conference
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:16.600]   and it was before we were married,
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.080]   we were going to go on a date.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.120]   And I didn't have any plans for Valentine's Day
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.280]   and I didn't have a lot of money.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.120]   And so you had the same,
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.360]   the normal humdrum Valentine's Day thing
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.120]   is you go to a nice restaurant and you dress up
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:30.080]   and you spend hundreds of dollars and blah, blah, blah.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:32.360]   But it's the worst night in the world to go out to eat
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.600]   'cause restaurants are full and everything's overpriced
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.080]   and it's just crowded and it's no fun at all.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.760]   So I was thinking, what can I do?
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:39.960]   What can I do?
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.360]   And so I picked her up
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.440]   and we tossed our bicycles into the car
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.800]   and we went to the grocery store
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.800]   and I said, listen, we got a budget.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.320]   I can't remember, I think it was $20.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.160]   And I said, oh, I've got $20.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.800]   What we're gonna do is we're going to build a meal
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.720]   off of $20 and we cannot spend more than that.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.800]   Here's our $20 bill, we will not spend more than that.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.400]   And so we went around and we spent 30 minutes
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:03.840]   wandering around the grocery store together,
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:08.840]   figuring out how to put together this memorable,
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.200]   how to put together a meal with our $20 and we did it.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.880]   We went out with a picnic lunch,
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.480]   we took our bicycles down to the beach,
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.360]   we sat on the beach, we had our picnic lunch.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.400]   And to this day, it is literally the only Valentine's Day
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.520]   date that I can ever remember with my wife.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.600]   Like I can't, the rest of them,
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.600]   and I'm preaching to myself,
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.600]   I haven't done a good enough job of differentiating them.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.240]   I need to do that, we've been a baby mode.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.600]   I have reasons, but anyway,
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.280]   like that's the one that I can remember.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.560]   And it wasn't the constraints,
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.040]   the financial constraints didn't make it bad.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:43.480]   It actually made it far more fun and far more interesting.
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.520]   And it's the one that I can remember.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:47.800]   I can remember how I felt sitting on the beach
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.640]   with her that night.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.800]   I can remember, oh, I can't remember what we ate.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.720]   I can remember what we did.
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.360]   I can remember the dress that she was wearing.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.720]   I can remember everything about that date
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.960]   because it was different and it was unique.
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.320]   And if I go through life,
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.800]   it's a lot of times those experiences that don't cost money
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.120]   that actually make a difference.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.240]   Now, where does money come in?
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:11.560]   Well, a lot of times you can invest money into people
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.800]   and give them those experiences.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.640]   And so if it's, hey, normally we'd go on vacation,
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.820]   but let's invite that family over there
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:20.520]   that wouldn't ordinarily be able to afford
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.000]   this kind of vacation to go with us
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.200]   and let's take them with us.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.160]   And now you have days to spend visiting with them
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.200]   and engaging with them, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:32.400]   So I just, I mean, there are more good categories
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:35.760]   to spend money on, but that's my just off the cuff
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:37.520]   answer to your question is that your house
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.720]   is a really good area to spend money on.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.480]   And the good thing, not only for daily pleasure
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.320]   and kind of dollars spent versus time enjoyed,
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.480]   but also for, it can potentially pay off.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.400]   Your career is a very good area to spend money on
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.840]   in terms of dollars spent versus pleasure engaged.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.000]   You're gonna spend, other than being in your house,
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.120]   you're gonna spend most of your time at work doing work.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.640]   And then the third thing is relationships.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.120]   Anytime you can spend money on relationships
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.660]   or spend money on other people,
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.760]   I think those are good dollars spent.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.880]   And those are the kinds of dollars you wanna increase
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.920]   every year in your budget, not decrease.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.840]   - Oh, I love it.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:18.160]   Especially, I mean, I have a growing family.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.280]   Like I said, I have a newborn.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:21.200]   You know, my significant other,
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.560]   she can be off work for six months.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.640]   She's spending all of her time in the home.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.760]   So just realizing that and just the enjoyment
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.280]   she gets out of having a nice home.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.760]   She's very aesthetically minded.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.080]   I'm not.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.080]   So pouring more into that,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.000]   I can definitely see the benefits there.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.240]   I have family out of state who can't afford to travel here.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.480]   Often, I've brought them out a few times and whatnot.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:45.800]   You said including others who maybe couldn't otherwise
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.480]   afford to be included, who you get a lot of enjoyment
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.040]   out of them being included.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.520]   I think that's another really good point.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.720]   Last quick question for you,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.200]   'cause you've mentioned chat GPT a few times.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.120]   And I have a brother who's actually become
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.400]   pretty infatuated with potential applications
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.400]   of just chat GPT and other AI technology
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.720]   and has become very interested
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.720]   in trying to invest in the space.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.320]   I don't really have any advice for him
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.480]   'cause that's not the way I invest
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.040]   and I don't really have any education there.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:17.320]   Do you have any thoughts though
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:20.680]   on how one could best educate themselves
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.520]   if they were interested in doing
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.120]   exactly what he's looking to do?
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.880]   - I thought you were gonna ask me
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.280]   how someone could invest in the space.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.040]   My answer was gonna be no, I don't have any thoughts.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.800]   But then you asked me the useful question
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.440]   is how someone could do about it,
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.520]   how someone could go about it.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.000]   I would, I think the primary thing there is Twitter.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.800]   There is no better information flow, information source
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.440]   to connect with the most intelligent,
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.240]   most connected people in the world than Twitter.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.160]   It is the world's greatest social network.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:52.520]   And it's one of the greatest social networks
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.800]   because of its openness and because of the caliber
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.200]   of people that are there.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.680]   And so what I would spend my time doing if I were him
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.640]   would be to just simply going on Twitter
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.880]   and following all of the discussion related to chat GPT.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.880]   The tool that I use to do that is TweetDeck.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.840]   TweetDeck is owned by Twitter now.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.640]   But the powerful thing about TweetDeck
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.640]   is that you can set it to automatically search Twitter.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.760]   And so what I would do is I would set up a use TweetDeck
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.440]   and I would set up a column related
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.920]   to every relevant search term, obvious one,
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.960]   chat GPT, AI, et cetera.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.000]   Then I would study the tweet results
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.880]   and find people who are using the tool significantly
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.720]   and then follow them individually as well
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.160]   with their own TweetDeck column.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:47.240]   And if you do that, you can pretty well keep yourself
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.920]   at the cutting edge of almost any industry
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.360]   or at least on the public information of any industry.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.280]   It is the best way to do it.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.880]   And so if you set up a properly cultivated TweetDeck system
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.520]   with about 20 or 30 columns with targeted keywords,
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.280]   keyword combinations,
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.600]   and then all of the relevant companies and people
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.800]   that are most involved in that,
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.040]   that's the best way I know of to keep current.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.000]   And then of course, Twitter is just a referral service.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.760]   So it's gonna refer him to the articles,
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:20.320]   the thinking, the threads, et cetera.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.680]   And you just follow those things along
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:25.920]   and then put in the thinking time into it.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.160]   And then of course, the other aspect to it
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.600]   is you need to be a thought leader.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.240]   And so I don't know, 'cause I'm not super into it,
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.240]   but if a dedicated, if he's interested in it,
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.300]   then he should have a Twitter profile
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:42.980]   that is dedicated to AI investing or something like that,
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:46.720]   where he curates all of the content on that.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:49.420]   Because what he, the goal is to not only go out
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:52.300]   and search for the content, but to have it referred to you
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:56.180]   because you are the curator of timely information
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.700]   and good discussion in that industry.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.000]   So that's what I would do.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.340]   - Okay, great.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:02.220]   I love that answer.
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.340]   And yeah, I wasn't gonna ask you
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:06.100]   what your specific advice would be,
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:08.660]   'cause I think I knew you wanna give it.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:11.780]   And two, what the value I always get from talking to you
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:13.900]   and listening to you is thinking about how to think
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.180]   and just ways on how to learn.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.580]   And I think nobody's gonna be able to predict
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:20.500]   what's gonna happen there perfectly.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.140]   I mean, we can all make our prognostications,
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:25.420]   but rather I'd have him just have some useful ways
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:26.240]   to think about it.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.080]   And I think that's what you gave me.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:28.300]   So appreciate it, Josh.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:29.140]   - My pleasure.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.180]   It's an exciting time.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:31.860]   It's an exciting technology.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:34.340]   It's not new, there's been versions of it,
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.900]   but it seems to have captured the public imagination.
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.260]   And that's pretty cool to see kind of where things can go.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:41.420]   Daniel in Texas, welcome to the show.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.940]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.020]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.900]   I appreciate it.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:48.740]   So two questions, depending on time,
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:50.220]   but I'll start first one,
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.780]   back to the whole job search thing.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:57.420]   Do you have a recommendation on, as we are,
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:59.300]   of course, we're always looking at the next recession,
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:03.060]   right, but we may more likely be going into a recession,
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.940]   but generally, do you have a suggestion
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.380]   on where to start of how to look at,
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:11.540]   how do I look to find a job that is going to be
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:16.540]   more recession layoff resistant as opposed to others?
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:17.380]   - Absolutely.
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:20.580]   When I was younger, I loved the joke
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:24.180]   that economists have successfully predicted 17
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:26.020]   of the last three recessions.
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:28.620]   And I always thought, ah, what a funny joke, right?
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:31.500]   Economists have successfully predicted 17
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.060]   of the last three recessions.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:35.420]   And I thought I would be immune from that.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:38.420]   I look back on my life and I think, hmm, Joshua,
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:40.300]   you've successfully predicted 17
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:42.220]   of the last three recessions.
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.740]   And somehow it just seems so much easier
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.540]   to connect with the negative side of life,
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.420]   the negative psychology, the doom and gloom predictions,
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.020]   than the happy-go-lucky positive,
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.260]   everything's gonna be wonderful.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.460]   So let's be prudent in all affairs,
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:59.500]   but not put excessive stock in our recession predictions.
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:03.260]   Yes, I would say there are two things
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:05.900]   that are really important.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:09.500]   The first is, there are certainly more than two,
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.300]   but there are two that I want to give an answer to you.
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:18.340]   The first kind of job that is not affected by a recession,
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.180]   or if that's too strong of a statement,
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:25.900]   is we could say the first kind of job
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:29.900]   that is the least affected by a recession
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:34.900]   is a job that is where you can specifically connect
[01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:39.980]   your job work to the revenue created.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:43.600]   Because if you can prove that you are creating revenue
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.820]   that is in excess of what you are costing,
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.220]   then your job security is pretty well assured.
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:55.060]   Now, the classic representation of this is sales.
[01:59:55.060 --> 02:00:00.060]   Salesmen do not risk job insecurity in a recession
[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:04.260]   if they can demonstrate that their work
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:07.900]   is bringing in more money than they're costing.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.240]   If I can show that I brought in $1 million of revenue,
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:17.900]   and thus I can justify my $150,000 commission rate,
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.480]   I'm gonna have a job,
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:24.480]   because that other $750,000 or $850,000 of revenue
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:28.020]   for the company is actually supporting a lot
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.700]   of other people based upon my efforts.
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:35.700]   So sales-related jobs are where you have one job
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:39.340]   supporting many other jobs.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:41.500]   I think there are other expressions of work
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.780]   where you can prove it.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:46.720]   So let's say the guy who is producing the widgets, right?
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:49.300]   If he can say, "Look, I produced a widget,
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:53.460]   "and I added $100 worth of value to this widget,
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:58.460]   "and my cost was $50 for the work that I did,
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:59.940]   "I'm worth it," right?
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.420]   Then that guy's got a good case as well.
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.580]   But you want to be able to tie your specific output
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.580]   to people, you wanna tie, be able to tie your expense
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:15.540]   to your employer to the specific output
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:17.260]   that you are creating.
[02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.220]   So let's use Twitter as an example, right?
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:20.460]   We're just talking about Twitter.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.080]   When Elon Musk came in and took over Twitter,
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.260]   bought the company, et cetera,
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:27.380]   it laid off huge swaths of the workforce.
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:30.820]   And there were apocalyptic predictions
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:32.780]   about how quickly Twitter was gonna collapse
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:35.060]   without these huge swaths of the workforce.
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:38.060]   The engineers, the ESG consultants,
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:43.020]   the diversity consultants, the trust and safety team,
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:43.860]   blah, blah, blah, right?
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.960]   He laid off huge swaths of these people.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.980]   None of those people could prove that their job
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:54.580]   and their work was making the company more money
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:56.260]   than they were costing.
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:58.660]   Otherwise, they would not have been gone
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:01.340]   unless there was a deep ideological problem
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.140]   or something like that.
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:06.660]   And the company seems to be running as well as ever.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:08.700]   I'm enjoying Twitter more than I ever did.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:10.700]   And everything about the experience
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.260]   is just as good if not better.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:14.520]   So that's the problem that you face.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.500]   If you're kind of a mid-level manager
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.120]   and you're responsible for a department,
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:20.400]   but your department is not bringing in money,
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.860]   it's just spending money, how do you predict that?
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:25.820]   So anything you can do to specifically show,
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:30.340]   hey, listen, boss, yes, I cost you $150,000 a year,
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:33.420]   but I can point to my million dollars of new contracts
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:36.020]   that I brought in, you're golden.
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.500]   I think also these positions are really good
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:42.900]   because unless your entire marketplace changes,
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:48.260]   these positions are good because you can,
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:52.500]   you get accustomed to defending your price
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:54.640]   and then you can do that in a recession
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:55.980]   or out of a recession.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:59.520]   One of the things that I'm so grateful for learning
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:01.900]   in the financial services business
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:05.900]   was that a good salesman can make money in any market.
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:09.140]   I started selling life insurance in 2008
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:12.220]   at the depths of the financial crisis.
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:15.080]   I couldn't tell you how many mortgage brokers
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.340]   and real estate people and broke real estate investors
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:20.060]   I sat with and tried to sell insurance.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.860]   They didn't buy it, generally speaking.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.700]   But what I learned through that
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:26.380]   was there were lots of people who needed insurance
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.680]   and it didn't really matter what,
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.680]   it didn't really matter that there was a recession on,
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.660]   because there were still plenty of people
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:40.480]   who weren't being impacted significantly by that recession.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:42.940]   My data point that I point to is this.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.660]   Remember that during the Great Depression,
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:50.820]   25% or one in four, let me apply that,
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.680]   making it stick or making numbers count methodology, right?
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:57.840]   One out of four people was out of work.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.300]   But what that means is practically
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:03.700]   three out of four people still had jobs.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.740]   Three out of four people still had work,
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:07.860]   which means that you had a huge population
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:09.220]   that you could sell to.
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:12.340]   And so sales is, it kind of puts that into perspective
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:15.460]   that even in the worst financial depression
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:16.940]   ever known in the United States,
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:18.540]   there was massive protection.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:20.860]   Okay, so category number one is can you have a job
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:23.420]   where you can specifically demonstrate
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:26.900]   that you make your boss more money than you cost him
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.660]   and hopefully a lot more?
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:32.860]   The second thing that I believe is really important
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:37.860]   is can I work in a job where we cater to wealthy people?
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:41.820]   Can I work in a job where we cater to wealthy people
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.020]   and especially in luxury goods in some way?
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:49.620]   Now, not everything is perfect, but the point is this.
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:54.080]   If we go through a recession and your local,
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:58.580]   your accountant who earns $80,000 per year
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:04.420]   has 10% of his client base go to free online alternatives
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:08.380]   instead of using his tax preparation services.
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:13.380]   And so his income goes from 80,000 to $72,000, 10% decline.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:16.380]   That's gonna hurt that accountant quite a lot.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:20.180]   That's almost coming up on,
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.180]   I wish I knew the number off the top of my head.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.220]   It's like $750 a month of spending, right?
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:27.620]   $600, $700, it's almost $1,000 a month.
[02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:30.940]   $8,000 a year of declined revenue out of over 12 months,
[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:35.020]   it's significant decline in his ability to spend money.
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.820]   And so he's gotta go through his budget
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:39.260]   and he's gonna start trimming out,
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:41.780]   call it $600 a month of expenses.
[02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:46.220]   And that means that, okay, my maid who was coming
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:48.080]   once a week is just not gonna come anymore.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:50.460]   We're gonna cut back our eating out budget by $200,
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:52.700]   we're gonna spend less on vacation, et cetera.
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:53.740]   But now flip it.
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:57.940]   Let's say that you're working for a local anesthesiologist
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:00.420]   who's making $800,000 a year.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.100]   And that anesthesiologist has a decline
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.300]   in his business by 10%.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.260]   And his decline now means
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:10.660]   that he's making $720,000 per year.
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:14.140]   That's probably gonna have very little impact
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:15.900]   on his lifestyle.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.580]   He might choose to forego a new car purchase,
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:20.020]   but he's not gonna lay off his maid.
[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:21.460]   He's not gonna fire,
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:23.340]   he's not gonna end his golf club membership.
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.700]   He's gonna continue.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:26.820]   Now, let's say that you're working for a guy
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:29.900]   or there's a guy who has $20 million
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:35.180]   and he has a 10% decrease in his portfolio values.
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:37.060]   Well, it's just not gonna make any difference
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.220]   in his day-to-day life.
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.620]   And so the point is that wealthy people
[02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:44.660]   are much less affected by recessions than non-wealthy people
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.300]   because they don't have to pull back so much.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.900]   They have so much more margin in their lifestyle.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.220]   And so there might be fewer Gulfstream orders
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.060]   in a bad recession, certainly.
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:57.700]   There might be fewer Boeing sold
[02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:00.040]   or fewer kind of luxury goods.
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:03.060]   But if you are working with and serving the wealthy,
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:07.300]   in general, you're not going to be affected
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:08.420]   significantly in a recession.
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.820]   So if your job involves serving wealthy people,
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:12.660]   you're well-protected in a recession.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:19.100]   - Okay, yeah, I think that totally makes sense.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:22.020]   Jack Spierger likes to say,
[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:23.580]   I don't know if he's heard him say this in particular,
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:25.820]   but like, you wanna be in the wants business,
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:26.900]   not the needs business.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:28.900]   'Cause people will argue for 12 years
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:32.060]   to negotiate down their cell phone bill by $5,
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:34.460]   but they won't give up their daily Starbucks.
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:35.300]   - Absolutely.
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:41.220]   - So how does that, maybe this is too hard to answer,
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:45.460]   but like, as I'm trying to get into the,
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.180]   basically at least within two to four years,
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:50.820]   get into the mid hundreds range.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:52.900]   Sales is not something I really wanna pursue,
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:53.740]   so I'll say that.
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:57.700]   I think I'm just not great suited for it
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:07:59.800]   unless it's something I'm just super into.
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:03.900]   So it's like, I'm especially looking at larger corporations.
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:05.620]   Obviously for that dollar amount,
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.860]   you're topically looking at middle management
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:08.940]   kind of style stuff too,
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.700]   because that's where a lot of that money is, right?
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:15.620]   Do you have a suggestion on how like,
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:18.140]   and it feels like as you get more into middle management,
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.340]   it becomes harder and harder to track
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.500]   the dollars associated to your job, right?
[02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:28.180]   Do you have a suggestion on kind of how to sort that out,
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:31.300]   or it's just so situation dependent?
[02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:34.020]   - It is very situation specific,
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:39.020]   because you do have to be very careful to identify,
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:41.600]   I mean, there's so many different career paths,
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:44.020]   different kinds of companies, et cetera.
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:45.820]   Before you dismiss sales though,
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:48.740]   let me just defend sales for just one moment.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:51.540]   Many people have a very limited view
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:54.780]   of what counts as sales.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:57.180]   So many people, their view of sales
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:59.020]   is selling life insurance, right?
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:01.180]   Selling life insurance is a great business.
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:03.300]   I myself could happily sell life insurance
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:05.700]   for the rest of my life and nothing else today.
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.380]   Like I love life insurance,
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:12.380]   but that's not in any way the only kind of sales.
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:17.080]   There is sales in virtually every business
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:18.780]   and in virtually every industry.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.720]   And the way that you approach sales
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:25.420]   can change dramatically based upon the industry.
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:30.420]   The guy who sells Airbus A330s for Airbus is in sales,
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:35.960]   but the day-to-day function that he has
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.000]   is very, very different
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.820]   than the guy who sells life insurance.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:44.280]   There are sales jobs
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.660]   that are extremely engineering focused.
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:49.300]   Then there are sales jobs
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:54.300]   that don't in any way involve personal contact.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:58.340]   So many times people who wouldn't ordinarily be
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:00.700]   quote unquote a salesman,
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.340]   really thrive in industries
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:05.600]   where they don't have to make contact, right?
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:09.420]   There are people who sell you stuff all day long online
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:11.460]   that never wanna see another human being,
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:13.120]   never wanna go out and shake hands
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.420]   and do your how are you's and who are you's,
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:19.360]   but they thrive on building complicated landing campaigns
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:22.900]   or designing beautifully performing
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:25.600]   email marketing campaigns or ads
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:28.720]   or constructing sales videos, et cetera.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.560]   There is no quote unquote type for sales.
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.480]   There is this wrong and flawed impression
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.860]   that some people have that salesmen are extroverts
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:41.920]   that love to go out and do their how are you's
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:44.180]   and who are you's and glad hand all the people.
[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:46.220]   That is a false impression.
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.800]   Sales is a very professional industry,
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.500]   excuse me, a very professional business
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:56.460]   with incredible diversity in the ways that it can be applied.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:58.680]   The key thing that is the same
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:01.540]   across all sales activities is what I said,
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:04.700]   that I can prove to you that based upon what I have done
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:07.660]   and what I have performed, I make you more money.
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.780]   And you can apply that and that kind of thinking
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.380]   is the best answer to your question.
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:14.860]   So if I go into a local business,
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:16.340]   let's say that I develop a skill
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:21.180]   of improving online presence for local businesses
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.060]   and I become skilled with doing that.
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:25.260]   If I can go into a local business and I can say,
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:28.140]   listen, I'll improve your revenue
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:30.720]   or increase your number of bookings
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.820]   by this number of customers or something like that,
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:37.460]   I can prove that I've got those results.
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:40.940]   And when I go into the same, into a business offering that
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:42.940]   and I start going up to levels, I lose that ability.
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:46.140]   So I don't think, I guess I just wanted to defend sales
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.280]   for a moment because there is a false impression
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:51.880]   that people have that it's all kind of what we stereotype
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:53.220]   as the used car salesman.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.960]   That stereotype by the way is also significantly broken,
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:58.100]   but there was like this 1980s,
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.540]   hey, you wanna buy a car today
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.460]   and do you want the purple one or the red one?
[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:03.460]   And that the wet world is dead and gone.
[02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:05.020]   Sales can be any expression.
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:07.560]   And many times introverts, engineers,
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.940]   people who even don't even love being with people
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:12.140]   are often the best sales people
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:14.500]   because they're the best sales engineers
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:16.300]   and they understand people.
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.660]   Last example, I have always loved Dan,
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:27.100]   left me, the sales guy wrote,
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:32.580]   rewrote "Psycho-Cybernetics".
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:37.100]   Anyway, Dan, it'll come to me in a moment,
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.220]   but now this is gonna bother me.
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:40.620]   It's not gonna come to me in a moment.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:44.100]   He republished "Psycho-Cybernetics"
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:50.260]   and anyway, the sales guru himself,
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:54.220]   Dan, whatever his last name is,
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:57.020]   I've listened to hundreds of hours of his audio.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:59.420]   And he was very famous.
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.300]   He sold billions of dollars of stuff.
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.420]   But one of the things that's so interesting about him
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:08.580]   is he was a copywriter and a salesman,
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:10.180]   an incredible salesman.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.740]   And he literally to the end of his career,
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.580]   he's at the end of his career,
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:18.500]   he sold his business to what's his name in Boise,
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:21.460]   to Russell Brunson.
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.100]   But he literally to the end of his career,
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:27.580]   he's only contactable by fax machine.
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:29.620]   That he sits in his home office
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:31.820]   surrounded by dozens and dozens of clocks
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:33.780]   reminding him of the shortness of time.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:37.540]   And he has run his entire business
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:40.940]   exclusively through a fax machine.
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:43.340]   And he doesn't interact with individuals
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:44.420]   really almost ever.
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:48.300]   He spends his time thinking and mostly in isolation.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:52.060]   Now on occasion he will go and he will give a presentation,
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.740]   he'll work with somebody, et cetera.
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:56.500]   But he's one of the world's all time greatest salesmen,
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:58.260]   sold billions of dollars of stuff
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.420]   and he never interacts with individuals.
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:03.460]   So he's my, if I could come up with his name,
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:06.620]   he's my go-to example of showing you
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:09.020]   how effective you can be as a salesman,
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:10.980]   even if you literally don't like people.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:13.220]   But you understand people and you can sit back
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:16.180]   and you can coordinate and organize.
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:17.340]   Beyond that, I would say,
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:19.900]   don't worry too much about a recession.
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:22.860]   Recessions come and go, focus on the long-term plan,
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.380]   deal with the recession if it comes.
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:27.140]   But sometimes they come, two weeks later, they're gone.
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:32.580]   - One more question.
[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:34.420]   - Sure, go ahead.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.580]   I've done these hour long answers, so go ahead.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.340]   - There you go.
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.980]   I wanted to say, I meant to say it at the beginning,
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.860]   but I forgot.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:42.740]   For the first caller, I think his name is Cody,
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:44.260]   if he's still listening,
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:45.780]   and I already posted on the Facebook group.
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:49.060]   But I have actually a lot of experience
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:51.620]   in a lot of that world with water features
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:54.780]   and landscaping and edible stuff.
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:56.660]   So if he wants to chat,
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:58.780]   I think I've got some great resources to him.
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:00.460]   You should reach out to me through Facebook
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:01.620]   and we can connect.
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:04.060]   So I think I can help him somewhat in that.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:04.900]   - Beautiful.
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:07.820]   So that second question being,
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:10.980]   and I guess the answer is probably relationships.
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:15.700]   But there's a lot of people who are largely successful.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.940]   Most of my jobs I've gotten
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:19.060]   have been through relationships.
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.620]   At this point, I don't necessarily
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:21.980]   have any more relationships,
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.340]   or especially looking at large corporations.
[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:26.900]   It's like, I know people at Boeing,
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:28.180]   I know some people at Halliburton,
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:29.340]   some of these big companies
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.180]   where there's lots of money, et cetera.
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:33.620]   But they're all like, well, apply for the job.
[02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:36.860]   I might be able to give you some thought of what it is.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.380]   I feel like I'm kind of at the end
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:40.820]   of how to build relationships
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:43.180]   to potentially connect you to other jobs.
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:45.340]   Do you have a suggestion
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:48.660]   on how to build more of those relationships?
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:51.340]   Or where, for especially some of the higher paying jobs,
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:52.180]   those connections are?
[02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:55.900]   Do they just, do those not exist for larger companies?
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:56.980]   Or, yeah.
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:00.260]   - Do you know the industry and the company
[02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:02.860]   and the job description that you would like to have?
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.460]   - I know somewhat the job description.
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:12.460]   Beyond that, I'm really open to whatever works.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:17.940]   - The problem is not that you've run out of people.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:21.180]   The problem is you have not been able
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:25.540]   to clarify for yourself the specific industry,
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:27.180]   the specific company,
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:29.980]   and possibly the specific job that you want.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:33.540]   You can build relationships.
[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:37.020]   The world revolves around relationships.
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:38.900]   But you can't build them randomly.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.700]   The random ones are the ones that are available to you now.
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:45.240]   The intentional ones are the ones that you go after.
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:46.820]   So if you wanna build a relationship,
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:48.100]   you have to know what am I trying
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.780]   to build a relationship around?
[02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:53.820]   If you wanna meet the top 10 people involved
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:57.220]   in programming chat GPT, like the previous caller,
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:58.060]   you can do that.
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.620]   And six months from now, you can know all 10 of them.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:02.660]   But you have to have an organizing principle
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:07.380]   that these are the 10 people that I want to know.
[02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:09.220]   If you wanna know 10 people at Halliburton,
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.500]   you could do that.
[02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:12.700]   But knowing 10 random people at Halliburton
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:14.300]   isn't gonna help you very much.
[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:18.860]   And so you have to have some basic idea
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:22.620]   of a job that you want in an industry
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.720]   and ideally at a company
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.060]   so that you can then target your relationship building.
[02:17:28.060 --> 02:17:31.160]   And so you can figure out who you're going to reach.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:36.140]   Once you have that, then you can make your list
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:39.740]   of who are the 10 people that are most connected to this
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:41.500]   or who are the 10 people that are likely
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:44.260]   to have the resources that I need in this.
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:45.900]   You can't just do it randomly.
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:47.420]   You have to know what you're going after,
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:48.960]   at least have some basic idea.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:53.140]   - Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:54.820]   I just have to figure out that.
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:55.980]   - Yeah.
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:57.980]   The man who says, "I want a job,"
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.640]   is gonna have a hard time finding it
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:01.980]   because he can't know where to start looking
[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:04.180]   other than just a random help want a job.
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.500]   But the man who says, "I want a job
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:09.540]   working in a mortgage company
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:14.540]   as a mortgage loan officer but not selling,"
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:17.260]   that man now pulls out the phone book,
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:19.360]   finds certain number of mortgage companies,
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.340]   starts meeting people,
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:22.580]   and a month later he'll have the job.
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:26.260]   So you gotta have some idea of where to start your search
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.220]   based upon what you want.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:30.920]   Then you can start making the contacts that you need.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.140]   So that would be my recommendation.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:35.020]   All right, move to Mark in Georgia.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:35.860]   Mark, welcome to the show.
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.100]   How can I serve you today?
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:41.900]   Mark in Georgia, are you there?
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:47.460]   Going once for Mark.
[02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:48.340]   - Once for Mark.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:49.700]   - Going twice.
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.300]   Mark, we'll come back to you in a minute.
[02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:52.780]   We go to Trey in Texas.
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:53.620]   Trey, welcome to the show.
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.620]   How can I serve you today?
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:56.660]   - Oh man, Joshua.
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:57.660]   (Joshua laughs)
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:18:59.460]   It's been a long one, hasn't it?
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:02.660]   - My bladder is telling me to answer your question quickly.
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:03.500]   - It's been good, man.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:05.140]   I'll tell you what, man, I had three questions,
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:06.980]   but one of them's probably better for my attorney anyway,
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:08.060]   and I'm gonna be talking to him next week.
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.500]   So I'm gonna give you two,
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:11.800]   and feel free to do rapid fire if you want to.
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:18.340]   The first one, you mentioned loving motorcycles
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:20.860]   on your recent Goal Setting podcast.
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:22.980]   And I also love motorcycles.
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:26.820]   And I currently have an Indian and a Harley.
[02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:30.500]   And of course, it's a fairly risky lifestyle.
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:31.580]   I just wanted to ask,
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:34.920]   how do you balance your love of motorcycles
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:38.220]   with your fatherly responsibility to stay alive?
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:40.620]   - Good question.
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:44.060]   When I first started riding motorcycles,
[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:48.140]   I thought it through very carefully.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:51.100]   And I discovered a couple of statistics
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.180]   that made a big difference.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:57.340]   So I can't cite the original factors today,
[02:19:57.340 --> 02:19:59.240]   so I'm just gonna use directional numbers,
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.740]   and you can look up the actual numbers.
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:09.700]   But I heard something like 50% of motorcycle accidents
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:13.340]   involve alcohol, something like that, a high percentage.
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:17.980]   And alcohol is extremely dangerous to a motorcycle rider,
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:21.820]   even in amounts that are not over the legal limit,
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:24.060]   because just a tiny bit of alcohol
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:29.060]   can cause slight variations in response times, et cetera,
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:32.040]   which can be the difference between life and death.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.700]   So I made a promise to myself.
[02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:36.020]   Number one, I'm gonna cut out 50% of accidents
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.480]   by never consuming a drop of alcohol when I'm riding.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.700]   And I never had a single drink,
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:43.560]   not a single drink ever when I'm riding a motorcycle.
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:48.360]   Number two, a huge percentage of motorcycle accidents
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:53.360]   are driven by riders who out-ride their ability.
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:59.760]   So one of the great problems of motorcycle statistics
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:01.560]   have to do with the sample set.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:06.520]   The most recent death, was it Joe Blow
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.000]   out on a Saturday morning ride down
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.920]   to see his buddy's house on his Harley,
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.360]   or was it the guy in his Hayabusa
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:15.120]   going 190 miles an hour down the interstate, right?
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:15.960]   Which was it?
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:18.200]   Well, they're all included in motorcycle deaths.
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.400]   But a lot of motorcycle accidents
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.720]   involve the rider out-riding his ability, right?
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:25.360]   Takes the curve too hard, flips over the top side,
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:27.520]   and is dead down on the cliff below.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:30.120]   So I promised myself I would never be an aggressive rider,
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:31.760]   and I would never out-ride my ability.
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:33.960]   Makes me not super fun, but that was the promise I made,
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:36.320]   is that I'm never gonna out-ride my ability.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.320]   The third thing that I chose was focused on rider skill.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:48.520]   Very many riders, especially kind of the weekend
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:52.160]   warrior riders, don't ever practice
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.240]   the skill of motorcycle riding.
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:56.520]   They don't actually practice the actual skills.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:57.840]   Now here's where I think a lot of times
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:59.640]   the sport bike guys do better,
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:00.920]   but they're riding so fast
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.640]   that it's pretty dangerous a lot of times.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:05.760]   But the weekend guy doesn't actually practice the skills.
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:10.560]   And so I would go out and practice all my slow speed stuff,
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:11.760]   slow speed maneuvering.
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:14.640]   I bought all of the Ride Like a Pro info products.
[02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:16.800]   Back then it was the DVDs, and I watched them all,
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.120]   and I would go out in the weekends,
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.000]   and I would practice in the parking lot,
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.640]   practice everything until I could come up
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:23.520]   and I could do a U-turn in a tiny space
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:25.440]   without putting my feet down.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.000]   I practiced emergency stopping.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.240]   I practiced all the skills.
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:31.120]   And then related to that,
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:33.840]   one of the big skills is proactive riding.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:36.720]   So you can't, as a motorcyclist,
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:39.200]   you can't control other drivers,
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.280]   but you can be prepared for them.
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.320]   So little things like covering the brakes
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:44.340]   whenever you're coming,
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:45.420]   whenever there's an opportunity
[02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:46.640]   where someone could pull out in front of you
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:47.960]   that you've already got the brakes covered.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:52.000]   That micro second to where you have the brakes covered
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.600]   'cause you're watching for someone
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:55.320]   to pull out in front of you
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:57.500]   from the left-hand side or whatever it is,
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.680]   that micro second is a big deal.
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:01.040]   And so practicing those things
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:04.400]   and constantly thinking where is the danger.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:08.560]   Then I tried to focus on riding in safer environments.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:12.400]   And so the most risky places to ride
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:14.920]   are stroads in the United States, right?
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:17.420]   These mixed lane things
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:19.840]   where you got people crossing all over the time.
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:20.680]   I hate those.
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:23.080]   And so riding on the interstate for a motorcyclist,
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:24.200]   very low risk.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:28.020]   Riding on a back two-lane road, relatively low risk.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:31.520]   Riding on four, six-lane stroads through town,
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.520]   there's a death sentence in many cases.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:37.480]   And then also I committed to wearing all the gear
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:38.320]   all the time.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:42.040]   So all the gear all the time to try to be protected.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:45.440]   So today, even including airbags, right?
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:46.920]   Having a, and doing it.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:47.760]   And people don't do it
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:49.640]   'cause they don't like the heat
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:51.280]   or they don't like the cool, et cetera,
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:52.400]   but that gear saves lives.
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:53.760]   So having a high quality helmet,
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:56.080]   having high quality riding jacket and stuff,
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:57.040]   that saves lives.
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:59.020]   And there are plenty of options available
[02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:01.560]   that give you kind of the riding environment.
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.620]   That said, I pretty much have given up
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:05.460]   motorcycle riding these days
[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:07.540]   because whenever I'm out there,
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:09.800]   it's not that I'm worried about the safety,
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:12.780]   but primarily it's that I think about
[02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:14.540]   what I could be doing instead.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:19.540]   And so being out on a motorcycle
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:22.900]   is gonna limit you to one or maximum two people.
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:24.460]   Whereas, you know, right?
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:26.380]   If you've got a bunch of children, what are you gonna do?
[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:28.720]   And I just can't justify that stuff.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:30.440]   I don't need to have a hobby
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:33.440]   that takes me away from home every Saturday for five hours.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.280]   My hobby is my children.
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.880]   And so I wanna do something that's gonna be with them.
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:40.080]   And so it just doesn't fit into my life.
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:42.400]   Now, when I'm older, maybe, will it change?
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:43.240]   Sure.
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:44.080]   You know, I always loved,
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:46.040]   one of my favorite stories was the,
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:48.560]   I think it was the Underwoods, the Horizons Unlimited,
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:51.520]   who this Australian couple who took their Harley-Davidson
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:52.520]   to every country in the world.
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:53.600]   Like, that's awesome.
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:57.860]   But that's not at this stage of my life.
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:59.220]   So I just don't bother anymore.
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:00.140]   I don't ride much.
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:02.140]   - There you go.
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:02.960]   Yeah, okay.
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.420]   Well, it's funny 'cause I mean, you're very logical.
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:07.100]   That's exactly the thought process I did as well.
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:08.300]   I looked up the stats and was like,
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:10.180]   oh, okay, well, don't drink and ride.
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:11.020]   You know, wear the gear.
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:13.460]   I don't do so great wearing the gear all the time.
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:14.900]   I should probably get one of those airbag vests,
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:16.980]   but you know, I wear my helmet and that kind of thing.
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:19.740]   And I typically will just build it into travel
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:21.580]   that I have to do already anyway,
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:22.980]   rather than travel for leisure.
[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:24.880]   So it doesn't really take much time.
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:25.860]   So cool, man.
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:27.920]   Thanks for clearing that up for me.
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:30.160]   Kind of confirms the way I was feeling about it.
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.960]   I don't wanna give up my life
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:36.400]   because also I wanna set an example for the kids.
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:38.000]   You know, that hey, you can still have fun
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.160]   when you're an adult.
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:40.960]   You should have hobbies.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.200]   So the last one is gonna be really quick.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.640]   I noticed some recent advertisements on your podcast
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:50.640]   and I wondered how can someone advertise on your podcast?
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:54.660]   - The recent ad, so over the years,
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:26:00.800]   over the years I've had a complicated relationship
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:02.920]   with podcast advertising.
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.040]   When I started the podcast,
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:10.040]   I had spent so many years in a deeply conflicted industry
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:11.960]   with lots of conflicts of interest
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:14.100]   and potential conflicts of interest
[02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:15.920]   that I just didn't want any of that.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:17.120]   And I thought, you know what?
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:18.960]   I'm just gonna give everything away
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.460]   and I'll do like a listener support model.
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.700]   Well, the listener support model was okay
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:27.820]   but the income was a fraction of what it could be.
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:30.580]   Basically, tiny, I had to go back and look at the numbers
[02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:33.860]   but it was a tiny, tiny fraction of the audience
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:35.940]   engaged in a listener support model.
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:37.940]   But I stuck to my guns and I'm like,
[02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:39.340]   no, I want the purity of this.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:42.780]   And so then I started selling courses
[02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:45.980]   and the courses have been my most profitable endeavor.
[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:50.880]   I do some consulting here and there
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.280]   but the course sales are my highly profitable endeavor
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:55.260]   that I really like.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:59.360]   And so I basically say, well, I'll do the podcast for free
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.140]   and then I'll sell the courses.
[02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:05.660]   But along the way, I'm coming up pretty soon
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:08.520]   on episode 1000 of the podcast.
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:11.600]   Should be here this next year.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:13.280]   And when I started off to do the show,
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:16.400]   I said, I'll do 1000 episodes and then I'll decide.
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:20.440]   Well, doing the podcast, I enjoy doing the podcast
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.000]   but I don't enjoy doing the podcast for free.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.520]   I enjoy doing the podcast as advertising for the courses
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.980]   but I don't enjoy doing the podcast for free.
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:30.240]   So I thought, well, how can I make it
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:32.640]   so that I want to do the podcast?
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:33.680]   That sounded really selfish.
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:36.600]   Like, I'm really grateful to do the podcast
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.120]   but it is also something that I don't, anyway.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:42.900]   So I thought, how can I make myself
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:44.480]   want to do the podcast?
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.560]   Well, I can make myself want to do the podcast
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:50.520]   if I actually earn money directly from the podcast.
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:53.920]   So years ago, I used to take some kind of,
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.120]   I used to take some sponsorships
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:58.980]   and I would sell ad packages and do those ads.
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:02.200]   And I wanted, I started with like the very altruistic,
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:05.000]   noble, like I'm gonna be the guy who personally
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.520]   endorses these advertisers.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.600]   And I would go through and I'd do all this research
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.600]   and all this thinking and I would give them my voice
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.760]   and I would play the ad.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.800]   The problem with that is number one,
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.400]   it's hard to do enough due diligence over your advertisers.
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:27.360]   So that, let's say that FTX came to me a year ago
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.560]   and says, Joshua, we want to sponsor your podcast.
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:31.820]   Well, would I have said yes to them
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.280]   or would I have said no to them?
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:34.160]   I don't know, right?
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:38.040]   I probably would have said yes if I were selling ad spaces
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:40.840]   because I didn't have any unique insight
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:43.720]   into the fact that it was a giant Ponzi scheme.
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:46.560]   I just, I'm not that connected to the industry.
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:49.800]   And so like that whole concept of personal endorsement
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.600]   is a very excruciating thing for me.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:56.560]   So the problem is that in podcast advertising,
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:58.640]   there's something called dynamic ad insertion.
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.080]   And there's been over the years that that's been available
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:05.500]   from several providers, but I never pursued it
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:07.320]   because I didn't really wanna do advertising
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:08.440]   for other people's stuff.
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:11.120]   I primarily like to just advertise my own stuff
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.200]   and I like to make my money from my own courses,
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:15.680]   my own products, 'cause those I can endorse.
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:18.560]   I know they're high quality and I'm happy with them
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:20.680]   and the money's really good.
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:24.000]   So anyway, but I said, well, let me try it.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.640]   So then my podcast host, which is Libsyn, came out
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.320]   and they created their own
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.680]   what's called dynamic ad insertion
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:35.320]   where they automatically put ads on the show.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:40.200]   And my audience size is quite large in the podcast space.
[02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:44.040]   And it means that the ads that can be bought
[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:47.620]   get a pretty good rate.
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:51.360]   And so the actual cost of them makes it worth my showing up
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.880]   and doing a podcast, because if there's three or four ads
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:57.160]   that play on the show, then they do it.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:29:58.120]   And by doing it that,
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:01.040]   and by using the dynamic ad insertion system,
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:05.000]   I actually have no control over the ads that are played.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.440]   And I'm not choosing them and they're not in my voice.
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:09.640]   So that helps me to feel good.
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.520]   It's just like the radio, right?
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:12.080]   Where they play something in between what you say.
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.680]   I'm responsible for what I say.
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:16.440]   I'm not responsible for what other people say.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:22.280]   And so I, anyway, that's what it is.
[02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:26.680]   It's a company that Libsyn interacts with
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:28.520]   and they buy ad spots.
[02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.280]   So how can you buy an ad on my show?
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.920]   Short answers, you can't.
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.980]   I can't guarantee you that anything will be on my show,
[02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:38.880]   'cause I don't control the ad flow or the ad inventory.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:41.080]   You could go and figure out who that company is
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:42.960]   and buy it by advertising from them,
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:45.880]   but that advertising would not appear just on my show.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:48.320]   It would appear on other people's shows.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.800]   Now that may change in the future.
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:53.960]   So that dynamic ad insertion is a little bit annoying
[02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:55.800]   because I don't have control over the ads.
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:57.160]   I have some control.
[02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:01.560]   I can control like to some degree what gets advertised,
[02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:03.880]   but some of that stuff is pretty,
[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:07.080]   like even if I exercise the category selection,
[02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:09.960]   I don't get the finite category selection.
[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:12.360]   So I may move to a different provider
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:15.380]   or I may just go ahead and go back to doing my own thing
[02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.760]   and setting up my own system
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:18.280]   where I did actually sell ad rates
[02:31:18.280 --> 02:31:20.840]   from people who were allied with my show.
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:23.920]   There was a show recently where somebody,
[02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:27.060]   they published an ad for HIV testing
[02:31:27.060 --> 02:31:31.120]   and they publish an ad for a transgender lifestyle podcast
[02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:32.340]   on my show.
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.740]   And one of my listeners wrote to me and said,
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:36.240]   "Josh, FYI, like these are the ads
[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:37.840]   "that are playing on your show.
[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:39.720]   "They're probably not a great fit for your brand."
[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:40.980]   And I was like, "Yeah, they're not.
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:45.800]   "I don't wanna be served with ads for HIV testing.
[02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:47.460]   "That's just, I don't even wanna think about it.
[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:49.680]   "It's not what I want showing up in my financial podcast
[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:53.080]   "and I don't want a transgender lifestyle promotion
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:54.360]   "podcast advertised."
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:56.880]   So they're still working out some kinks and I'm patient
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:58.560]   and we're working on it and we'll see.
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:00.400]   I haven't decided that, but at the moment,
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:03.460]   I'm not accepting personalized advertising.
[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:06.380]   Maybe that can happen in the future, maybe not.
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:07.920]   We'll see, but at the moment,
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:10.140]   the best thing you can do is plug your thing.
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:12.580]   So plug your thing, you got 30 seconds, go ahead.
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:16.100]   - Well, it's a, I appreciate that.
[02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:18.940]   It's actually HIV testing for LGBT.
[02:32:18.940 --> 02:32:19.780]   (laughing)
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:21.500]   - Wonderful, wonderful.
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:24.300]   Very much in favor of the Radical Personal Finance audience
[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:26.500]   you're gonna be overwhelmed with business.
[02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:28.460]   - No, I'm just kidding.
[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:29.300]   No, I'll do it real quick.
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:33.700]   So it's a budgeting and financial forecasting software
[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:37.540]   for companies to use in their financial planning.
[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:40.540]   So really just like forecasting income statements primarily.
[02:32:40.540 --> 02:32:43.380]   - Wonderful, do you have a website?
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:46.940]   - Well, actually no, we just bought a domain
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:48.540]   and we've been building it locally,
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.020]   but it's called Bridge First.
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:51.060]   - Bridge First.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:54.100]   - Yes, sir, one word, Bridge First.
[02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:54.940]   - BridgeFirst.com.
[02:32:54.940 --> 02:32:55.780]   - Because it's based on a bridge, yeah, like,
[02:32:55.780 --> 02:32:56.860]   yep, yes, that's right.
[02:32:56.860 --> 02:32:58.240]   And you can get ahold of me in the meantime
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:03.240]   at Trey, T-R-E-Y @maloneconsultingfirm.com.
[02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:06.580]   - Wonderful, so if anybody's looking for budgeting
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:10.620]   and cashflow forecasting software for companies,
[02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:13.660]   you can contact my loyal listener Trey
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:17.140]   at maloneconsulting.com or potentially in the future
[02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:19.220]   go to bridgefirst.com.
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:20.060]   Fair enough?
[02:33:20.060 --> 02:33:22.220]   - Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:24.020]   - Best ad deal you're ever gonna get
[02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:27.540]   on Radical Personal Finance, I promise you that.
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.140]   All right, Mark in Georgia, are you there this time?
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:33.720]   - Yes, Joshua, I am.
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.940]   I just tuned in to listen.
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:36.780]   - You just tuned in to listen.
[02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:37.960]   - Sorry, I just tuned in to listen.
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:38.800]   - All right.
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:41.680]   - Yeah, so good news for you, right?
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:46.680]   Hey, great answer on the motorcycle perspective.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:51.720]   I'm a motorcyclist too and that was a very good answer
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:53.200]   at every point.
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:55.000]   - I think you can reduce the risk enough
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.920]   to make it acceptable.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:00.200]   And I don't think that living risk-free is life's goal.
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:01.560]   It's always just a matter of
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:03.480]   what's an acceptable level of risk.
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.500]   And so to me, when I look, like driving a car is risky,
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:09.820]   very risky, it's not as risky as riding a motorcycle,
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:11.040]   but it is very risky.
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:12.720]   And yet we still drive cars.
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.800]   There are many things that we do that are risky.
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:17.480]   And so for someone, I don't know
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:19.660]   that life is a computer program.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:21.480]   I know for me, when I went through
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:24.160]   those risk reduction exercises,
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:26.560]   I felt like that adjusted the numerical risk
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:29.360]   significantly enough to where I would be content with it.
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.480]   And I would encourage when there is something
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:35.120]   you can do to reduce risk,
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:36.680]   it's silly, that doesn't harm anything.
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:37.740]   It's silly not to do it, right?
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:39.760]   It's fun to take your motorcycle out
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:42.160]   and practice slow speed maneuvering in a parking lot.
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:44.800]   It's fun to go out and do emergency braking.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:48.620]   It's fun to swap in your old antiquated motorcycle
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:53.440]   for a modern motorcycle with ABS.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.640]   I was borrowing a friend's motorcycle recently,
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:01.240]   it was some time back, and we'd gone to an event together
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:03.200]   and he had ridden there and I had driven.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.640]   I was like, "Listen, swap me out."
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:05.880]   So I was riding his motorcycle back
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:07.520]   and I was riding through the mountains
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:11.160]   and blew out a tire going around a curve.
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:12.640]   And I wobbled off the road.
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:14.000]   And I was thankful at that moment
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.520]   for all of the training and all of the practice.
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:20.680]   But every time I ride an older motorcycle
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.240]   and I lock up the wheels and have to recover,
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:26.360]   I just think to myself,
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.920]   "Joshua, why are you riding a motorcycle without ABS?"
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:30.400]   There's just no reason for it.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.880]   So all those risk reduction things, I think,
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:34.720]   bring it into an acceptable zone
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:35.880]   as long as you're not riding around
[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:37.680]   on city streets all the time.
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:38.920]   And at the end of the day,
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:42.160]   living a risk-free life is not the goal.
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:44.280]   The goal is to do the things that you want,
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:45.840]   to live the way that you want, et cetera.
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:48.500]   And my biggest reason is just simply,
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:49.520]   I agree with the previous caller
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:52.720]   about that it's fine to have hobbies,
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:56.600]   but my biggest thing is just simply,
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.040]   it just seems like not something that I love to do.
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:01.680]   My wife is with the children all during the week,
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:03.040]   a lot of times when I'm working.
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:04.920]   And so the idea of my getting on a motorcycle
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:06.560]   and going out on a four or five hour ride
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.800]   is just distasteful to me.
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:10.160]   So 20 years, I'll probably be in a different situation,
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.860]   but I'll be riding an ABS motorcycle, that's for sure.
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:16.200]   All right, Mark.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.020]   Well, thanks for calling in.
[02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:18.640]   Next time, just wait for the recording
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.120]   'cause I promise you it is exactly,
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:24.480]   it's just published very soon after the show.
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:27.080]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.480]   Any closing announcements?
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.560]   I've got a new course coming out.
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:33.800]   Gabriel Custodia and I are launching a new course
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.960]   that should be out with information on that this next week.
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:38.960]   We're excited about that.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:40.800]   I've got a bunch of new things that I'm working on.
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:42.000]   It's gonna be a great new year
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:45.000]   and I'm very excited about sharing it with you.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.040]   Thank you for being here.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:47.840]   I don't say thank you enough,
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:52.240]   but I do wanna just say as I close today's show, thank you.
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:55.080]   For you to be here, listening to me is an honor
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:56.960]   and I will continue to do everything I can
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:59.800]   to make it a good and valuable use of your time.

[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.940]   (upbeat music)
