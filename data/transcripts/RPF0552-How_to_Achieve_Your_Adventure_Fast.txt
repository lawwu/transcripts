[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   I love this story. I read a story about a guy named Jim one time.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And Jim grew up up in, based on the story that I came across.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   Jim grew up in rural Idaho.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he was half white, half Shoshone.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he was half white, half Shoshone.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he was half white, half Shoshone.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   And he grew up in rural Idaho.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   And he grew up in rural Idaho. And he grew up in rural Idaho. And he was a special forces fighter in Vietnam, and he was injured in the United States. Back in the early 1990s, Jim decided that he was done with just the normal work a day world. He wanted to spend more time out, traveling the country and seeing the United States of America. So he had been previously teaching using his military experience and his military experience.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   I wanted to spend more time out, traveling the country and seeing the United States of America. So he had been previously teaching using his military experience and his military experience.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   The students got together and helped him create for himself what he needed to travel in.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   He put together for his vehicle, he bought an old Nissan pickup truck that had been rolled upside down and the engine and the transmission had been pulled from it.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   So they took off the body from the vehicle and they put it in the truck.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   The students got together and helped him create for himself what he needed to travel in.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   The students got together and helped him create for himself what he needed to travel in.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   Everything in their entire project was either scavenged from junk that was lying around or just bought cheap used.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   He put together for his vehicle, he bought an old Nissan pickup truck that had been rolled upside down and the engine and the transmission had been pulled from it.

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:15:10.260]  , they built a wooden wagon seat on the front and they made a wooden pedal to activate the brakes.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:21.080]   They put in a deep cycle battery with a small solar panel to run it with, to give him a small automotive light inside the wagon for light at night.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.260]   Put in a CB radio, an AM FM radio.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:31.860]   And then they put together for, to pull the rig, he put together a team of three burrows just side by side.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.820]   They made the harnesses from old discarded fire hoses.

If you're single and it's just you and you're just trying to figure out, well, I'm going to go and do whatever I want, you're in the most flexible situation of your life. Again, put your boots on and just start walking. You can do that. If you want to drive, great. Ride a bicycle, great. Ride a motorcycle, great. Buy a motorhome, great. If you are married, of course you'll have different considerations. I bet you my wife, if I worked with you, you're going to be a professional.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:20:10.460]   I bet she would go traveling in a gypsy wagon with burrows. That's not the choice that I've made. But it has been very important to me that I want to get out on the road and do my adventure with a bare minimum. And that buys you a number of things. If you commit to your adventures with a bare minimum, it buys you freedom where you're not so invested in your adventures that they have to work. A lot of people buy a big fancy RV, buy a big fancy sailboat, they get out there and they decide, find out they don't like it.

[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:41.460]   was Fred. But he was an
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.820]   typical, if I just said t
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.960]   guy, van dweller, he's p
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.140]   imagine. He was white hai
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.900]   overweight, kind of unkem
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:53.940]   hair and whatnot. His van
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:02.880]   I don't, I don't get why
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   I don't, I don't get why
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   I don't, I don't get why
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   I don't, I don't get why people like have a lot of
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   people like have a lot of
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:32.920]  , I don't understand why people sometimes do this, but
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   people sometimes do this, but Fred didn't didn't bother Fred if he looked like a van dweller. The front of his van, the front dashboard stacked with books, stacked with papers, stacked with magazines. But the thing about Fred, he just lived in his van and he found places to park it. And he would come down to Florida and the place I encountered him was a friend's house. Friend had an acre and a quarter and the deal was Fred could just park out under a pine tree.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:40.960]   Friend had an acre and a quarter and the deal was Fred could just park out under a pine tree. He didn't have anything out there. He just parked under a pine tree. And every few days he would move his van to, I assume, go get gas or dispose of his stuff. I don't know. But then he would come back and he just parked out under the pine tree.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   But then he would come back and he just parked out under the pine tree.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   But then he would come back and he just parked out under the pine tree.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   But when you look at something like that, he had just a small Social Security payment that was his source of income, you realize that what Fred's actually done is he's just changed his standards.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   But when you look at something like that, he had just a small Social Security payment that was his source of income, you realize that what Fred's actually done is he's just changed his standards.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:24.000]   My closing point is this. You and your standards are the impediment to your adventure. You could today go and live like Fred did. But your standards will probably not want you to live that way. If you want to, go for it. But your standards of living are the impediments to your adventure.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But your standards will probably not want you to live that way. If you want to, go for it. But your standards of living are the impediments to your adventure.

[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:57.040]  .
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   I'm not opposed to standards of living. I would have no problem living in a van. I wouldn't have all the junk. I'm a fan of standards. But most standards are negotiable. Comfort. Comfort is a relative thing. You might say, "Well, I only sleep well when I have a really comfortable mattress."
