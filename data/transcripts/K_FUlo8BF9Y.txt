[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   - But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology of starting to talk about something before
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   that singularity?
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.560]   - Yes, well I began, I was just thinking to myself, how boring this universe is going
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   to be.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.560]   You've got this exponential expansion, this was discovered early in this century, 21st
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   century, people discovered that these supernova exploding stars showed that the universe is
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.540]   actually undergoing this exponential expansion.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.880]   So it's a self-similar expansion.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.980]   And it seems to be a feature of this term that Einstein introduced into his cosmology
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.600]   for the wrong reason.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.840]   He wanted a universe that was static, he put this new term into his cosmology to make it
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   make sense, it's called the cosmological constant.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.320]   And then when he got convinced that the universe had a big bang, he retracted it, complaining
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   that this was his greatest blunder.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.840]   The trouble is it wasn't a blunder, it was actually right.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.000]   Very ironic.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.040]   And so the universe seems to be behaving with this cosmological constant.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.520]   Okay, so this universe is expanding and expanding, what's going to happen in the future?
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.920]   Well, it gets more and more boring for a while.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.600]   What's the most interesting thing in the universe?
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.860]   Well, there's black holes.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.120]   The black holes more or less gulp down entire clusters of galaxies.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.520]   It'll swallow up most of our galaxy, we will run into our Andromeda galaxy's black hole,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.740]   that black hole will swallow our one, they'll get bigger and bigger, and they'll basically
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.160]   swallow up the whole cluster of galaxies, gulp it all down.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.840]   Pretty well all, most of it, maybe not all, most of it.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.460]   Okay, and then that'll happen to, there'll be just these black holes around, pretty boring,
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.600]   but still not as boring as it's going to get.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.960]   It's going to get more boring because these black holes, you wait, you wait, and you wait,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.840]   and you wait, and you wait, an unbelievable length of time, and Hawking's black hole evaporation
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   starts to come in.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.400]   And the black holes, you just, it's incredibly tedious, finally evaporate away.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.720]   Each one goes away, disappears with a pop at the end.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.940]   What could be more boring?
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.840]   It was boring then, now this is really boring.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   There's nothing, not even black holes.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.240]   This gets colder and colder and colder and colder, and I thought, this is very, very
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   boring.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.560]   Now that's not science, is it?
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   But it's emotional.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.680]   So I thought, who's going to be bored by this universe?
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.000]   Not us, we won't be around.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.180]   It'll be mostly photons running around.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.760]   And what the photons do, they don't get bored because it's part of relativity, you see.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.040]   It's not really that they don't experience anything, that's not the point.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.640]   Photons get right out to infinity without experience any time.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.080]   It's the way relativity works.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.480]   And this was part of what I used to do in my old days when I was looking at gravitational
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.920]   radiation and how things behaved in infinity.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.100]   Infinity is just like another place.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.280]   You can squash it down, as long as you don't have any mass in the world, infinity is just
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.500]   another place.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.800]   The photons get there, the gravitons get there.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   What do they get?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   They run to infinity.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.360]   And they say, "Well, now I'm here, what do I do?
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.680]   There's something on the other side, is there?"
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.600]   The usual view is just a mathematical notion.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.680]   There's nothing on the other side, that's just the boundary of it.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.280]   A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures by the Dutch artist M.C.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   Escher.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   You may know them, the ones called Circle Limits.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.520]   They're a very famous one with the angels and the devils.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.040]   And you can see them crowding and crowding and crowding up to the edge.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.440]   Now the kind of geometry that these angels and devils inhabit, that's their infinity.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040]   But from our perspective, infinity is just a place.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   Okay, there is-
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   - I'm sorry, can you just take a brief pause?
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   - Yes.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.080]   - In just the words you're saying, infinity is just a place.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.220]   So for the most part, infinity, sort of even just going back, infinity is a mathematical
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220]   concept.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.220]   - I think this is one of the-
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.300]   - But there's an actual physical manifest, in which way does infinity ever manifest itself
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.700]   in our physical universe?
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.780]   - Well, it does in various places.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.340]   You see, it's a thing that if you're not a mathematician, you think, "Oh, infinity, I
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.340]   can't think about that."
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.660]   Mathematicians think about infinity all the time.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.060]   They get used to the idea and they just play around with different kinds of infinities
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.220]   and it becomes no problem.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.460]   But you just have to take my word for it.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.300]   One of the things is, you see, you take a Euclidean geometry.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.660]   Well, it just keeps on, keeps on, keeps on going and it goes out to infinity.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.260]   Now there's other kinds of geometry and this is what's called hyperbolic geometry.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260]   It's a bit like Euclidean geometry, it's a little bit different.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.380]   It's like what Escher was trying to describe in his "Angels and Devils."
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.700]   And he learned about this from Coxeter and he think that's a very nice thing.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.220]   I try and represent this infinity to this kind of geometry.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.420]   So it's not quite Euclidean geometry, it's a bit like it, that the angels and the devils
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.420]   inhabit.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.060]   And their infinity, by this nice transformation, you squash their infinity down so you can
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.220]   draw it as this nice circle boundary to their universe.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.900]   Now from our outside perspective, we can see their infinity as this boundary.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.100]   Now what I'm saying is that it's very like that.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.180]   The infinity that we might experience like those angels and devils in their world can
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.940]   be thought of as a boundary.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.980]   Now I found this a very useful way of talking about radiation, gravitational radiation and
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.900]   things like that.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.600]   It was a trick, a mathematical trick.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.480]   So now what I'm saying is that that mathematical trick becomes real.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:53.560]   That somehow the photons, they need to go somewhere because from their perspective,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.200]   infinity is just another place.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.680]   Now this is a difficult idea to get your mind around.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   So that's one of the reasons cosmologists are finding a lot of trouble taking me seriously.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   But to me it's not such a wild idea.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.120]   What's on the other side of that infinity?
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.640]   You have to think, why am I allowed to think of this?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.020]   Because photons don't have any mass.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.600]   And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.620]   There are incredibly precise clocks, atomic and nuclear clocks, unbelievably precise.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.840]   Why are they so precise?
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.860]   Because of the two most famous equations of 20th century physics.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.060]   One of them is Einstein's E equals MC squared.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.400]   What's that tell us?
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.880]   Energy and mass are equivalent.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   The other one is even older than that, still 20th century, only just.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.720]   Max Planck E equals h nu.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   Nu is a frequency, h is a constant again like c, E is energy.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.600]   Energy and frequency are equivalent.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   Put the two together, energy and mass are equivalent, Einstein.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.320]   Energy and frequency are equivalent, Max Planck.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.000]   Put the two together, mass and frequency are equivalent.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.120]   Absolutely basic physical principle.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:21.480]   If you have a massive entity, a massive particle, it is a clock with a very, very precise frequency.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.160]   It's not, you can't directly use it, you have to scale it down.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   So your atomic and nuclear clocks, but that's the basic principle.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.240]   You scale it down to something you can actually perceive.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.880]   But it's the same principle.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.920]   If you have mass, you have beautiful clocks.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   But the other side of that coin is, if you don't have mass, you don't have clocks.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.200]   If you don't have clocks, you don't have rulers, you don't have scale.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.440]   So you don't have space and time.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.560]   You don't have a measure of the scale of space and time.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.840]   You do have the structure, what's called the conformal structure.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.760]   You see, it's what the angels and devils have.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.240]   If you look at the eye of the devil, no matter how close to the boundary it is, it has the
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.880]   same shape, but it has a different size.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.480]   So you can scale up and you can scale down, but you mustn't change the shape.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.840]   So it's basically the same idea, but applied to space-time now.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.320]   In the very remote future, you have things which don't measure the scale, but the shape,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.520]   if you like, is still there.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.040]   Now that's in the remote future.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   Now I'm going to do the exact opposite.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.720]   Now I'm going to go way back into the Big Bang.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.840]   Now as you get there, things get hotter and hotter, denser and denser.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.440]   What's the universe dominated by?
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.760]   Particles moving around almost with the speed of light.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.000]   When they get almost with the speed of light, okay, they begin to lose the mass too.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.920]   For a completely opposite reason, they lose the sense of scale as well.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.540]   So my crazy idea is the Big Bang and a remote future, they seem completely different.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.100]   One is extremely dense, extremely hot.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.800]   The other is very, very rarefied and very, very cold.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.400]   But if you squash one down by this conformal scaling, you get the other.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.420]   So although they look and feel very different, they're really almost the same.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.560]   The remote future on the other side, I'm claiming is that, where do the photons go?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.720]   They go into the next Big Bang.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.400]   You've got to get your mind around that crazy idea.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   Taking a step on the other side of the place that is infinity.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   Okay, but...
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.680]   So I'm saying the other side of our Big Bang, now I'm going back into the Big Bang.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   Back, backwards.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.200]   There was the remote future of a previous eon.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   Previous eon.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.340]   And what I'm saying is that previous eon, there are signals coming through to us which
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.900]   we can see and which we do see.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.600]   And these are both signals, the two main signals are to do with black holes.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.200]   One of them is the collisions between black holes.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.120]   And as they spiral into each other, they release a lot of energy in the form of gravitational
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.260]   waves.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.320]   Those gravitational waves get through in a certain form into the next eon.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.240]   That's fascinating that there's some, I mean, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.400]   that means that some information can travel from another eon.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Exactly.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.360]   That is fascinating.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:33.400]   I mean, I've seen somewhere described sort of the discussion of the Fermi Paradox, you
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.200]   know, that if there's intelligent life, communication immediately takes you there.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   So...
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.820]   We have a paper, my colleague Vaheguru, who I worked with on these ideas for a while,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.760]   we have a crazy paper on that, yes.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.720]   So looking at the Fermi Paradox, yes.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:58.960]   Right, so if the universe is just cycling over and over and over, punctuated by the
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.840]   singularity of the Big Bang, and then intelligent, or any kind of intelligent systems can communicate
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.760]   through from eon to eon, why haven't we heard anything from our alien friends?
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.120]   Because we don't know how to look.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   That's fundamentally the reason.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   I don't know, you see, it's speculation.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.000]   I mean, the SETI program is a reasonable thing to do, but still speculation.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.560]   It's trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away was a civilization which got there first,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.880]   before us, early enough that they could send us signals, but how far away would you need
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   to go before...
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.520]   We have so little knowledge about that.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.960]   We haven't seen any signals yet, but it's worth looking.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   It's worth looking.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.600]   And what I'm trying to say, here's another possible place where you might look.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.240]   Now you're not looking at civilizations which got there first.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.080]   You're looking at those civilizations which were so successful, probably a lot more successful
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:05.240]   than they were likely to be by the looks of things, which knew how to handle their own
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.720]   global warming or whatever it is, and to get through it all, and to live to a ripe old
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.160]   age in the sense of a civilization, to the extent that they could harness signals that
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.640]   they could propagate through, for some reason of their own desires, whatever we wouldn't
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.200]   know, to other civilizations which might be able to pick up the signals.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.840]   But what kind of signals would they be?
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.920]   I haven't the foggiest.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   [laughs]
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   [silence]
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   [end]
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   1
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   2
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   3
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   4
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   5
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   6
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   7
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   8
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   9
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   10
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   11
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   12
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   13
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   14
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   15
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   16
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   17
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   18
