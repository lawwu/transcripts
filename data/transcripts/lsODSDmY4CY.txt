[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today is an Ask Me Anything or AMA episode,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880]   which is part of our premium subscriber content.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   which still comes out once a week, every Monday,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.460]   and of course is zero cost to consumer.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.960]   The premium channel is also designed to support
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   exciting research being done at major universities
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.940]   like Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.080]   research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.440]   for mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   in the near future.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   If you'd like to check out
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.500]   the premium channel subscription model,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160]   you can go to HubermanLab.com/premium,

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.120]   and download the premium podcast feed.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.800]   And for those of you that are not already
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.140]   Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760]   you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500]   of this episode, and hopefully that will allow you
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.040]   to discern whether or not you would like
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.720]   to become a premium subscriber.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.120]   Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.720]   And as always, I will strive to be as clear as possible,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   as succinct as possible, and as thorough as possible,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.760]   while still answering as many questions per AMA episode
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.020]   as I can without these sessions becoming unreasonably long.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.000]   I should also point out that if you asked a question
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.400]   and it was not answered this AMA,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.560]   it may very well be answered in the next AMA.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440]   So the first question, which had a lot of upvotes,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.800]   meaning many people wanted the answer to this question,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.480]   came from Jackson Lipfort.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.560]   And the question was about so-called ultradian rhythms.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.000]   For those of you that are not familiar
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.280]   with ultradian rhythms, ultradian rhythms are any rhythms
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760]   that are shorter than 24 hours.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.820]   And typically when people ask about
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.560]   or talk about ultradian rhythms,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.820]   they are referring to 90 minute rhythms.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.800]   I've talked about these on the podcast before.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.440]   And Jackson's question was,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.300]   how do you use ultradian rhythms in your daily work?
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.400]   There's more to the question, but first off,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.060]   I do use ultradian rhythms.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.960]   That is, I leverage the fact that these do exist
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.200]   in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.640]   of mental work once or twice,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.200]   or sometimes three times per day.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.700]   However, I use them in a way that's grounded in the research
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.980]   on ultradian rhythms for learning and memory
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400]   in a way that might not be obvious just from their name,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.080]   that they are 90 minute rhythms.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.660]   So I'll get into the details of how to use ultradian rhythms
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.680]   to best capture neuroplasticity,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.080]   that is the brain's ability to change
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.700]   in response to experience,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.040]   and in a way that should allow you to get one or two,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.940]   or maybe even three focused bouts of learning per day,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.760]   which can greatly accelerate learning of cognitive material,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.400]   languages, mathematics, history for sake of school or work,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200]   or maybe just a hobby or a personal interest of some sort,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.940]   and for skill learning in the physical domain as well.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.520]   Jackson then went on to ask,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.360]   you've mentioned before that you try to include
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.700]   at least one 90 minute focus block per day
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.280]   as part of your work and overall mission.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.400]   And indeed that is true.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.600]   I try to get at least one of these focused
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.940]   ultradian rhythm blocks per day.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.300]   That is a period of about 90 minutes
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.040]   where I'm focused on learning something
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.300]   or doing something that's cognitively hard.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.640]   Although typically I aim for two of these sessions per day.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.600]   He then goes on to ask,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   what is the maximum number of blocks
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.260]   you can perform sustainably?
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.420]   The answer to that is probably four.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.640]   And I say probably because some people have schedules,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.580]   lifestyles in which four 90 minute blocks
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.120]   of focused learning is possible per day,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.260]   but that's highly unusual.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.720]   For most people, it's going to be one or two, maybe three,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   four I would place in the really extraordinary
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800]   end of things.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.400]   Maybe if you're cramming for exams
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.580]   or you've managed to go on a writing retreat
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.540]   or a learning retreat of some sort,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.840]   where you can devote essentially all of your non sleeping,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560]   non eating time to learning.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.640]   But most people simply can't organize their life that way.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.880]   So the short answer is for me,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   it's one or two per day is the target
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   and three would be the maximum.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.220]   He then went on to ask,
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.120]   do you take vacations or extended breaks
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.720]   from these ultradian rhythm sessions?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.260]   And the short answer is no.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.180]   Typically I try and do this every day.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.520]   And yes, even on the weekends,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.640]   but on the weekend,
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   the ultradian rhythm focused learning bout
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120]   might just be reading a book for about 90 minutes or so,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.720]   which might not be as cognitively difficult
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.740]   as it is for other sorts of work
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.040]   that I performed during the week.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.840]   I occasionally miss a day entirely for whatever reason,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.740]   travel obligations related to family, et cetera.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.920]   But in general, I try and do this every day.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.400]   I do think that the circuits for focus are,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.160]   I guess the non-biological way to put it would be kept warm,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.480]   but essentially that accessing the circuits for focus
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.240]   is made easier by accessing them regularly.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.900]   And that's because the circuits for focus
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.660]   are indeed themselves amenable to neuroplasticity
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.140]   In other words, the more you force yourself to focus,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.160]   the easier focusing gets.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.880]   I'll now answer the last part of the question,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.900]   and then I will go through and emphasize some tools
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.740]   that anyone can use in order to leverage ultradian rhythms
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.560]   toward learning bouts, either cognitive learning
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.160]   or physical skill learning, or a combination of the two.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.220]   The last part of the question Jackson asked was,
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.400]   if you knew you needed to drastically increase
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.180]   the amount of focus you do daily,
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.200]   how would you schedule that focus and recover from it?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.440]   That's an excellent aspect to this question.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.200]   And I will now give you the details
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.080]   of how I would use and schedule ultradian rhythms.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.140]   I'll offer you a tool.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.400]   I've never talked about this tool
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.700]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.080]   And I will dispel a common myth about ultradian rhythms
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.000]   that points to a, believe it or not,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.340]   an easier way to leverage them for maximum benefit.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.620]   Okay, so as I mentioned before,
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.120]   ultradian rhythms are these 90 minute cycles
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.160]   that we go through from the time that we are born
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   until the time we die.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.020]   Indeed, even during sleep, we are experiencing
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.300]   and more or less governed by these ultradian rhythms.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.180]   This question and this answer is not so much about sleep,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.000]   but just know that when you go to sleep at night
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.560]   until you wake up in the morning,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.040]   every 90 minutes or so, your patterns of sleep,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.720]   that is the percentage or ratio rather of slow wave sleep
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.660]   to light sleep to rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.360]   changes in a way such that each 90 minute cycle
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.560]   gates the next cycle.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.380]   It sort of flips the on switch for the next 90 minute cycle,
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.060]   then that 90 minute cycle ends,
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.380]   flips the on switch for the next one
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.640]   and so on and so forth.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.480]   I mentioned all that because during the daytime,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.600]   the same thing is true,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.880]   but most people don't know
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.040]   when the 90 minute ultradian cycles begin.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   Because if you think about it,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.840]   you could wake up on the basis of an alarm clock
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.120]   or noise in the room,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.380]   or simply because you naturally wake up
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.280]   in the middle of an ultradian 90 minute cycle.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.080]   So does that mean, for instance,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.640]   that if you wake up 60 minutes into an ultradian cycle,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.880]   that the next 30 minutes of your waking, right?
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.160]   Because that 60 minutes needs to continue to 90
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.500]   to complete an ultradian cycle,
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.760]   that the next 30 minutes after waking
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   are related to the ultradian cycle
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.120]   that you were still in during sleep,
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.880]   or does it start a new ultradian cycle?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.440]   And the answer is the former,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.380]   that ultradian cycle continues
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.560]   even if you wake up in the middle of it.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.360]   And so a lot of people who want to leverage ultradian cycles
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   for learning will say,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.660]   well, how do I know when to start one?
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.520]   Does it start when I hit my stopwatch?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.800]   Can I just set a clock and work for 90 minutes?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.600]   And the short answer is no.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.940]   And that might seem unfortunate,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.280]   but the good news is that you can figure out
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.800]   when your first proper ultradian cycle of the day begins
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.440]   simply by asking yourself,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.680]   when are you most alert after waking?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   That is, if you were say to wake up at 7 a.m.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.960]   and let's say that's the end of an ultradian cycle,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.680]   or perhaps you're in the middle of an ultradian cycle,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.200]   doesn't matter.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.540]   What you need to watch for
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.220]   or pay attention to for a day or so
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.080]   is when you start to experience
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.160]   your greatest state of mental alertness in the morning.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.080]   And here we can discard with all the issues
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.140]   and variables around caffeine or no caffeine,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.200]   hydrating or no hydrating.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.720]   Exercise is one variable that we'll consider in a moment,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   but here's the deal.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   These ultradian cycles are actually triggered
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.480]   by fluctuations in the so-called glucocorticoid system,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.280]   the system that regulates cortisol release.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.520]   And as some of you have probably heard me say before,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.460]   cortisol, even though it's often discussed
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.560]   as a terrible thing,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   it's chronic stress, cortisol, cortisol, et cetera,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.360]   cortisol is essential for health.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.160]   And every day we get a rise in cortisol in the morning
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.360]   that is associated with enhanced immune function,
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   enhanced alertness, enhanced ability to focus,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.240]   so on and so forth.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.080]   In fact, the protocol that I'm always beating the drum about
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   that people should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.400]   as close to waking as possible,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.580]   that actually enhances or increases the peak level
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.600]   of cortisol that's experienced early in the day.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.700]   And that sets in motion
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.360]   a number of these ultradian cycles.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.280]   So for instance, if you wake up at 7 AM
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   and you find that for the first hour after waking,
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.080]   you tend to be a little bit groggy
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.360]   or you happen to be groggy on a given day,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   but then you notice that your attention alertness
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.320]   starts to peak somewhere around 9.30 AM or 10 AM,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.340]   you can be pretty sure that that first ultradian cycle
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.020]   for learning is going to be optimal
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.780]   to start at about 9.30 or 10 AM.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.520]   How can I say about if it's indeed a 90 minute cycle?
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.880]   Well, this is really where the underlying neurobiology
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.380]   in these ultradian cycles converge
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.060]   to give you a specific protocol.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.400]   The changes in cortisol that occur throughout the day
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.380]   involve, yes, a big peak early in the day,
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.340]   if you're getting your sunlight and caffeine
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.860]   and maybe even some exercise early in the day,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.040]   but typically that peak comes early
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.120]   and then across the day, the baseline jitters a little bit.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.240]   It comes down, but it bounces around a little bit.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.420]   It's not a flat line
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.320]   if we were to measure your glucocorticoid levels.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.360]   Each one of those little bumps corresponds to a shift
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.240]   in these ultradian cycles.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.280]   So if you find that you are most alert at 9.30
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.320]   or starting to become alert at 9.30
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.260]   and then typically you have a peak of focus
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.380]   and concentration around 10 AM,
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.160]   that is really valuable to know
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.920]   because the way that the molecules
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.800]   that control neuroplasticity,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.760]   that is the changes in neurons and other cell types
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.700]   in the brain that allow your nervous system to learn
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.600]   and literally for new connections to form between neurons,
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.760]   which is basically the basis of learning,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.600]   those fluctuate according to these ultradian cycles.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.660]   What does this mean?
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.140]   This means if your peak and alertness and focus and energy
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.820]   could even be experienced as physical energy
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.900]   occurs at about 9.30 AM,
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.580]   I would start your first ultradian cycle for learning
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.020]   somewhere around there.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.960]   Certainly 9.30 AM would be ideal,
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.740]   but 10 AM would be fine as well.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.220]   And then you have about one hour
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.260]   to get the maximum amount of learning in
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.000]   even within that ultradian cycle.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.620]   This is where there's a lot of confusion out there.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.040]   People think, oh, ultradian cycles are 90 minutes.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.500]   Therefore we should be in our peak level of focus
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.760]   throughout that 90 minutes.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.280]   In reality, most people take about 10 or 15 minutes
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.120]   to break into a really deep trench of focus.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.580]   And then periodically throughout the next hour,
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.620]   they'll pop out of that focus
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.460]   and have to deliberately refocus.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.120]   This is why, if possible,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.720]   you want to turn off wifi connections
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.900]   and put your phone in the other room or turn it off.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.500]   If you do need your phone or wifi,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.980]   just be aware of how distracting those things can be
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.520]   to getting into a deep trench of focus.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.360]   But the point is this,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.680]   these 90 minute cycles occur periodically
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.640]   throughout the day,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.300]   but there is going to be one period early in the day.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.620]   And here I'm referring to this period
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.620]   as starting at about 9.30 or 10 AM.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.540]   And then likely another one in the mid to late afternoon
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.340]   that are going to be ideal for focused learning.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.780]   And that focused learning about should ideally
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   have you set your clock,
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.720]   a stopwatch or something to measure 90 minutes.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.180]   But do assume that there's going to be
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.400]   some jitter at the front end
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.140]   where you're not going to be able to focus
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.180]   as deeply as you would like.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.900]   Then you'll get about an hour of deep focus.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.380]   And then you really start to transition
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.540]   out of these ultradian cycles.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.280]   How do you know when the afternoon ultradian cycle occurs?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.560]   Well, just as in the morning it occurs
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.620]   because there's a brief but significant increase
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.600]   in the glucocorticoid system in the mid to late afternoon.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.580]   I wish I could tell you it's going to be 2 PM
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.740]   or it's going to be 3 PM.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.700]   That's really going to depend on the individual
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.820]   when you ingest caffeine,
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.860]   some of the other demands of your day.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.020]   But you can learn to recognize
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.060]   when these two periods for optimized learning will occur.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.780]   And here are the key principles.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.780]   Watch for a day or two, meaning pay attention
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.840]   to when you have your peak levels of physical
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.460]   and mental energy in the morning.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.220]   That is between waking and noon.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.680]   And then again, between noon and about 6 or 7 PM.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.600]   Although I'm sure that there are some late shifted folks
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.180]   that will experience their peak and focus
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.700]   somewhere around 6 or 7 PM,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.740]   especially if they're waking up around 10 or 11 AM
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.340]   as I know some people out there are.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.280]   Once you know where those peaks and focus occur
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.060]   on your schedule, set a stopwatch for one ultradian cycle
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.580]   in the early part of the day.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.300]   In this example, I was saying 9.30,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.060]   but if you can't hop on it until 10, that's fine.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.980]   Set it for 90 minutes, consider that block wholly,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.980]   meaning rule out all other distractions,
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.060]   but assume that within that 90 minute block,
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.580]   you were only going to be able to focus intensely
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.620]   for about one hour.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.820]   And just know that the molecules that control neuroplasticity
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.700]   and these things have names and yes,
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.700]   brain derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.360]   is sort of the most famous of those,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.660]   but there are others as well.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.880]   In fact, the very receptors that control synaptic strength,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.420]   the connections between neurons,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.980]   some of the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators involved
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.840]   in synaptic plasticity, they undergo regulation
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.780]   by these ultradian or changes in glucocorticoid.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.940]   And then try and capture a second
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.520]   ultradian learning block in the afternoon.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.720]   Again, just knowing that the first 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.500]   consider it mental warmup, and then you get about an hour,
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.780]   it's not exactly 60 minutes,
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.640]   but about an hour to maximize learning.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.100]   So if you're trying to learn something,
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.300]   really capture it during that phase as well.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.020]   Now, is there a third opportunity or a fourth opportunity?
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.620]   This relates to Jackson's question directly.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.900]   And the short answer is not really.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.240]   Unless you're somebody who requires very little sleep,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.380]   within the 12 or 16 hours that one tends to be awake
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.940]   during the day or 18 hours that one tends to be awake,
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.020]   there are really only two of these major peaks
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.540]   in the glucocorticoid system
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.700]   that trigger the onset of these circadian cycles.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.520]   Again, there's sort of a ramping up and a ramping down
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.280]   of glucocorticoids throughout the day.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.860]   But the real key here is to learn when you tend
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.740]   to be most focused based on your regular sleep wake cycle,
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.660]   caffeine intake, exercise, et cetera.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.020]   And again, that's going to vary from person to person.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.780]   And you really only have two opportunities
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.080]   or two ultradian cycles to capture
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.520]   in order to get the maximum focus,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.620]   challenging work done, AKA learning.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.300]   So for somebody that wants to learn
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.220]   an immense amount of material or who has the opportunity
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.100]   to capture another ultradian cycle,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.140]   the other time where that tends to occur
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.720]   is also early days.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.580]   So some people by waking up early and using stimulants
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.840]   like caffeine and hydration
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.080]   or some brief high intensity exercise
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.260]   can trigger that cortisol pulse
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.700]   to shift a little bit earlier
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.860]   so that they can capture a morning work block
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.460]   that occurs somewhere, let's say between six and 7.30 AM.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.500]   So let's think about our typical person,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.020]   at least in my example, that's waking up around 7.00 AM.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.180]   And then I said,
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.500]   has their first ultradian work cycle really flip on
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.540]   'cause that bump in cortisol around 9.30 or 10.00 AM?
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.120]   If that person were say to set their alarm clock
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   for 5.30 AM, then get up, get some artificial light.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.800]   If the sun isn't out, turn on brighter artificial lights,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.540]   or if the sun happens to be up that time of year,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.180]   get some sunlight in your eyes.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.980]   But irrespective of sunlight,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.620]   we're to get a little bit of brief high intensity exercise,
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.780]   maybe 10 or 15 minutes of skipping rope
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.200]   or even just jumping jacks or go out for a brief jog.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.980]   What happens then is the cortisol pulse
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.740]   starts to shift earlier.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.700]   And so the next day and the following day
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.880]   and so on and so forth,
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.540]   provided they're still doing that exercise first thing
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.960]   and ideally getting some light in their eyes as well.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.100]   Well, then they have an opportunity to capture
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.300]   an increase in cortisol that is now shifted
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.260]   from about 7.00 AM to about 8.30 AM.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.940]   So they can capture an hour of work there
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.360]   and then they will also still be within that rising phase
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.820]   of cortisol in the 9.30 to 10.00 AM block
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.220]   that lasts until about 11.30 or so.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.980]   They might have lunch, perhaps after lunch,
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.140]   they do a non-sleep deep rest, maybe they don't,
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.880]   maybe you're a napper, maybe you're not,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.860]   doesn't really matter.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.600]   And then in the afternoon,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.560]   and I would suspect it would now be in the earlier afternoon,
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.580]   sometime around two or 2.30 would be typical.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.800]   Although again, that exact time will vary person to person,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.760]   then they would want to schedule another
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   90 minute work block.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.420]   So that's how you can capture three.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.660]   Now you can start to see also why capturing
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.780]   four ultradian work blocks would be exceedingly rare.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.660]   It's just not typical that people are awake
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.980]   for that much of the day, you have to sleep at some point.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.740]   And I should mention that if you're going to force yourself
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.880]   to wake up earlier on a consistent basis,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.780]   you probably should be trying to get to sleep
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.900]   a little bit earlier as well,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.100]   because it's not just the quality,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.200]   but the duration of quality sleep that really matters
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   for learning.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.580]   And I should also remind everybody that the actual rewiring
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.300]   of neurons does not occur during any focused work block.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.740]   It actually occurs during deep sleep the following night
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.020]   and the following night and during non-sleep deep rest.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.300]   This is why non-sleep deep rest can accelerate learning
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.180]   because it's in states of rest that the actual connections
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.140]   between neurons strengthen or weaken or new neurons are
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.420]   added in a way that allows for what we call learning.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.760]   Okay, so one or two ultradian work blocks per day
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.420]   is typical, three would be really exceptional
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.880]   and four would be extraordinary.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.900]   Look for them, meaning look to see when you are feeling
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.580]   most focused and alert,
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.580]   typically in the period before waking and noon,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.220]   and typically in the period between noon and bedtime,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.900]   given your standard intake of caffeine and exercise
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.300]   and other life events.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.820]   Please also remember that even though it's an ultradian
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.680]   90 minute work block,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.300]   the neuroplasticity is going to be best triggered
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.440]   within a 60 minute portion of that.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.500]   And there's no way to know exactly when that 60 minutes
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.060]   begins and ends until you actually begin the work block.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.200]   So this is really designed to be empirical.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.580]   You need to actually go do this.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.460]   What you'll notice again is that it's hard to focus
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.580]   at first, then you'll drop into a state of focus.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.520]   You may get distracted, that's perfectly normal.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.040]   You refocus, get back into triggering learning.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.880]   That's really what you're doing.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.220]   You're triggering learning and then there'll be some taper
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.420]   and then you'll be out of the ultradian work block.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.260]   Now it's also key to understand that myself and other people
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.140]   should not expect that they're only working
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.040]   during these 90 minute work blocks.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.540]   It's just that a lot of the sorts of demands of our day,
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.780]   including, you know, cooking and shopping for groceries
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.820]   and email and text messaging and social media,
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.020]   a lot of those things don't require intense focus
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.520]   of the sort that I believe Jackson is asking
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.280]   about maximizing and that I'm referring to
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.540]   when I talk about these ultradian work blocks.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.180]   And then as a final point,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.860]   I've been talking about these ultradian work blocks
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.740]   and focus, et cetera, in a context that brings to mind ideas
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.140]   about cognitive work.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.620]   So learning a language, learning math, writing or creating,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.900]   doing something related to music, et cetera.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.580]   But these 90 minute ultradian work blocks
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.740]   also directly relate to physical skill learning as well
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.460]   and to physical exercise as well.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.560]   So if you are somebody who's really interested
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.380]   in improving your fitness and your fitness requires
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.220]   a lot of focused attention.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.180]   So for instance, when I go out for a long run on Sundays,
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.300]   which is part of my fitness routine,
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.180]   I'm deliberately not thinking about much.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.380]   I'm just trying to cruise along.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.700]   I might focus a little bit on my pace and stride,
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.460]   maybe an audio book I'm listening to or a podcast,
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.780]   but typically I'm just kind of cruising along.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.020]   It's low cognitive demand work.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.700]   These ultradian work blocks can really be maximized
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.820]   for pure cognitive work.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.480]   So kind of book type work, et cetera, music, et cetera,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.820]   or they can also be leveraged toward skill learning.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.040]   So if you're trying to learn how to dance
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.240]   or how to perform a particular athletic move,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.460]   or you're trying to get better at some skill
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.240]   that requires a lot of focus and alignment
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.960]   of muscular movement and cognitive demands, et cetera,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.180]   well then these are also going to be ideal
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.260]   for triggering neuroplasticity to get better
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:50.220]   in the motor skill based domain as it's called, et cetera.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.180]   If you'd like to learn more about ultradian shifts
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.020]   in neuroplasticity and ultradian work bouts,
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.700]   I will certainly do more on this
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.860]   in the Standard Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.740]   but the keywords to look up,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.460]   if you want to explore this further online,
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.620]   it's not something that a lot of people know about,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.220]   it's called iterative metaplasticity.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.180]   It's a vast literature and one that I'd be happy to teach
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.020]   you in a standard podcast episode.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.420]   But in the interest of getting to more questions
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.760]   from you all, hopefully the answer I've given you now
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.380]   has been complete enough, yet clear enough,
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.760]   and yet succinct enough that you can start to leverage
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.420]   these really powerful aspects of iterative metaplasticity
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.600]   and ultradian rhythms for learning.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.740]   And I'd just like to point out that these opportunities
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.540]   for focused learning that occur
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.520]   in these 90 minute ultradian cycles
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.700]   are really terrific opportunities.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.980]   They are offered to you at least twice every day,
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.660]   and you can really learn to detect when they occur
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.580]   and when they're likely to occur.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.360]   You can certainly learn at other times in the 24 hour cycle,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.000]   but for anyone who's tried to stay up late at night
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.500]   cramming for an exam, or for somebody who's tried to learn
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.320]   during the sleepiest time of their afternoon,
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.100]   we can be very familiar with the fact
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.420]   that there are times of day in which we are best at learning
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.080]   and as I've just described, there are ways to capture
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.680]   those moments and they are valuable moments.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.180]   So even though it's just about three hours per day,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.580]   or really only two hours per day
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.100]   'cause of the 60, 90 minute thing
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.860]   that I talked about a few minutes ago,
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.580]   learn to know when these occur
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.260]   and really treat them as valuable, maybe even wholly
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.220]   in the sense that they are really the times
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.200]   that are offered up to you each day by your own biology
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.580]   in ways that will allow you to get better
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.940]   pretty much at anything.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.500]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.440]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.820]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.420]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.680]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.900]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.500]   Standard Channel and premium tools
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.900]   not released anywhere else,
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.060]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.260]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.460]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.340]   it's really twofold.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.260]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.740]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.780]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.460]   every Monday in full length.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.860]   We are not going to change the format
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.440]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.880]   and to fund research,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.940]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.980]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.780]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.980]   that we are most interested in.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.980]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.620]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.660]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.560]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.960]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.660]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.980]   and other media channels.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.560]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.740]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.920]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.660]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   in the first place.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.020]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.980]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.760]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.260]   for research through the premium channel.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.860]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.820]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.880]   to further support research for science
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.660]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.180]   physical health, and performance.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.020]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.780]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.860]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.620]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.960]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.840]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.440]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.820]   that other people ask as well.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.760]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.560]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.120]   and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.680]   podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.020]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.360]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.800]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.440]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.360]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.180]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.760]   [upbeat music]
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.340]   (upbeat music)
