[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.520]   All right, so we have a question here from Juliet.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.040]   This may win the award for the longest question that's
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.240]   ever been submitted.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020]   It takes up 1 and 1/2 pages, single space printed out here.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.520]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.760]   to do a little bit of creative editing
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.640]   because there's a very good question in here.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.520]   We just maybe will excise some of the details.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.480]   So Juliet is asking about mornings.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.520]   She says, I want to ask you for help with mornings.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.160]   I find it easy to stick to my time blocks
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.480]   and to have a productive and focused day once I start work.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.960]   However, at least 50% of the time, I don't start work
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.680]   on time.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   Now, she goes on-- this is where I'm going to excise or elide
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.520]   some of the details.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   There's reasons for this.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640]   Number one, insomnia, which I get
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.440]   because I have to some degree.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.200]   And two, there's a fibromyalgia issue.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600]   The details here are complicated,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.800]   but it has a real impact on the morning as well.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.280]   So it's just very hard.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.920]   She has a schedule that has a lot of things in the morning--
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.040]   meditation, yoga, running-- that's
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.640]   supposed to have her working by 9:30.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.560]   50% of the time, she doesn't get there.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.360]   So then she goes on-- if we skip past there,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.280]   she goes on and says, I think you'll say, Juliet,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   at some point, you've got to be a professional,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.520]   and professionals show up to work on time.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.080]   This is, of course, irrefutable, and it's what I need to do.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   But I thought this would still be a useful question
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.040]   to ask because I can't believe I'm
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.840]   the only homeworker out there who struggles with mornings.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.000]   Am I, though?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.640]   No, Juliet, look, I'm often slow to start in the mornings.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.800]   I'm not great with mornings.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.760]   I'm not a morning person.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.680]   I usually am upset by how late I actually
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.240]   get going with work in the mornings,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600]   exactly like you describe.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.520]   And I don't really have the same really legitimate reasons
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   you have to justify why I have a hard time getting
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920]   ready in the morning.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.120]   So some things are fixed.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.520]   We get up.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   I walk my older two boys to the bus stop.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   I got to get them ready, which, by the way,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.640]   is an impossible task.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.360]   It is crazy.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   Can I just say as an aside, have you
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.680]   ever tried in a 20-minute period at 7 AM in the morning
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.760]   to get an eight-year-old and a six-year-old
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.920]   ready to go to school?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.800]   You would think that I came downstairs and said, boys,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.160]   I'm sorry, I need a working low wattage nuclear fission
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.920]   reaction put together by 7/20.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.120]   You would think that's what I basically asked,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.360]   that you need to go find some uranium and a high capacity
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   welding arc torch and build a nuclear fission reaction.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.320]   Basically, I might as well be asking that.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.720]   So what I've started doing--
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.760]   and Juliet, I'm sorry to go off on the side here,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.000]   but this is just my life right now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   What I've been doing then is we've
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.840]   been structuring my wife and I more and more
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.320]   every step of how they get ready.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   Because if we leave them any room, they literally freeze.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.880]   They literally freeze.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.600]   You'll come back.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   I could light the items on the table around them on fire.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.160]   And if we left them alone without instructions,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.240]   they would just sit there with the fire spreading around them.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.560]   They just won't move.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.320]   So everything, do this, then do that,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.120]   then do this.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.320]   And the other morning, I think I had everything down.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.800]   I literally put a timer on the table
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   while they're eating breakfast so they can see.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   You've got to eat, because when that timer is up,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   we've got to move on.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.040]   You can't just literally freeze for 20 minutes.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.880]   And I had it all worked out down to the very last thing, which
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.000]   was like, OK, we make them pack their stuff ahead of time,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.320]   put everything, your jackets, everything by the door
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.920]   before you sit down and eat breakfast.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   It's all there.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.800]   Had a timer during breakfast, so you
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.160]   have to eat, because the day before, my six-year-old just
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.200]   sat there, and then after 20 minutes, hadn't eaten a thing.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.700]   All right, everything's figured out.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.440]   We're on time.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.320]   Go put on your stuff.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.960]   I go up, change, come down to take them out there.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.280]   They had basically just frozen in the room next to there.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.720]   They went to their stuff and just sat there.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.160]   So frustrating.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.600]   Anyways, that's all a tangent, Juliet.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   So I do that.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.280]   I take my boys to school.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.320]   That's fine.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's not on me.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   That's hard.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.160]   And then I just can't--
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.200]   I can't get ready fast.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.920]   I can't do it.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   My wife makes fun of me.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.160]   I don't know how normal people do this.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.960]   Normal people, my wife will be downstairs.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   We'll be talking.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.880]   And she's like, oh, I got to get ready to take the kids to school.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.360]   I got to grab a shower, et cetera.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.720]   Four minutes later, she's downstairs,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.960]   showered, fully dressed, taking the kids out the door.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   This takes me 35 minutes.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.840]   And I don't know why it takes me so-- it just eats up my time.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   Somehow, getting ready just eats up all of my time.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.440]   And I'm ranting a little bit about this, because I'm
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.560]   so frustrated with myself, that you would think
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.160]   taking a shower, shaving, putting on clothes
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.440]   should take about 15 minutes.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.680]   It takes me 35 minutes.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   I've even tried.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.840]   I've literally tried to break it down step by step.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.200]   How can I squeeze time out of it?
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.480]   I've put on timers.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   It just takes me forever.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.960]   It takes me five times the time it takes my wife.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.000]   I'm not doing anything special.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.040]   I just-- I don't know.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.720]   Maybe I get stuck thinking in the shower.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   That's probably true.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.440]   But more often than not, it'll be 9 or 9 30.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.840]   And I really haven't done anything yet.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.960]   And I have to leave by 10, a little after 10,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   to get to campus to teach.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.420]   And so there's not enough time to get anything done.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.320]   And morning after morning, I'm thinking, look,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.120]   I've been up since 6.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.720]   And here I am driving to work at 10.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.520]   I haven't done anything.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.040]   All of this leads to, Juliette, you're not a morning person.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.760]   It's fine.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.160]   Have a later-- put a big buffer into your morning
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.720]   and have a later start.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.920]   And if you get started early, then you can end early.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.320]   It's not a big deal.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.680]   But just start your day at 10 30 or something.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   I mean, I basically do that a lot of days anyway.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.100]   So anyways, I thought in honor of the longest question that
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.600]   had ever been submitted, I would give an unnecessarily long
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.100]   answer.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.420]   But there we go.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.020]   My mornings are an entire source of frustration for me,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.520]   Juliette.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.260]   So welcome to the club.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.160]   We had jackets made.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.060]   We'll send you one.
