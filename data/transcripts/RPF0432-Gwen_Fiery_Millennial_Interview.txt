[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Gwen, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So, we're up here in Gainesville, Florida, at Camp Mustache Southeast 2017.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So it's providing me with an awesome opportunity to get together with other people who are pursuing financial independence,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   some of whom have websites, some of whom don't, etc.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So tell us a little bit about your story, especially as it relates to money and financial independence.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So, my name is Gwen, and I run the website Fire Millennials.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And I started my journey back in high school, actually, when my parents sat me down and told me that I was not getting any help for college.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And so I needed to figure out how I was going to pay for it myself.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   When did they do that? Did they, like, spring it on you on your high school graduation, or was this something that...
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   No, thankfully they did it at the end of my sophomore year of high school.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So I had two years to come up with everything, and they gave me a deal.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   They said, "We pay for two years of community college. You can live at home, pretty cheap, or you can go and do a four-year university by yourself."
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And unfortunately, our relationship frayed over time, and staying with them was no longer an option.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I ended up briefly homeless for a little bit.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And so I had to figure out how to pay for college myself.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So I worked really hard at academics and extracurriculars and sports, and just had a very robust resume, as it were, and had good grades.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So I submitted for a lot of scholarships and got a few, but they wouldn't help everything.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And I didn't want to get loans because I was broke and I didn't want to be in debt.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So I joined the military and was in it for six years, and they helped pay for some of it.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What age? Right at 18?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Right at 18, yeah.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   The summer after I graduated, before I went my freshman year.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And then I got a call right after I signed my name on the dotted line that said,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   "Hey, we've got a full-ride scholarship with your name on it. If you want it, somebody else turned theirs down."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Really? From a school that you had...
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   From the school that I went to.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Ah, right after you had enlisted.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Right after I enlisted.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So it was kind of like, "Ugh."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   At the same time, they paid for all of my school.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Right, right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So that was a great way to get out of college debt-free.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So you served six years in the military.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Six years in the military.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Which branch?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The Air National Guard.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   What did you do?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I was in IT, which actually kick-started the rest of my career because I was like, "Eh, this IT stuff is pretty easy."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So when I got back from training, I was like, "Huh, I'm going to do this on the civilian side and make lots of money, and it's going to be awesome."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Learning how to load mortar shells into a mortar doesn't necessarily translate over to the civilian world, but certainly IT skills can.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yes, and that's exactly what I was thinking of when I signed up.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I was like, "Well, I could do this, but there's not really any direct translation but IT. That's really useful now."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So I went through college, graduated debt-free.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Because of the military grants.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Because of the scholarship and the military grants.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And while I was in college, I ran across Mr. Money Mustache's blog somehow.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Just hanging around the internet one day.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And I was like, "Wow, that's really amazing. I don't have to work anymore. Whoa, this is great."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I love being in college.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   If I could just be in college all the time, I would totally do it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You get to take naps in the afternoon.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You get to learn stuff.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And especially I had an internship, and I learned what it was like to be working in an office environment.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It was like, "This sucks. I don't want to do this for the rest of my life."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   "How are people going to survive this? This is terrible."
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So when I got my job right out of college, I started saving pretty much immediately.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And got involved in the personal finance, financial independence world.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And just kind of blossomed from there.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So that's been how many years now since you graduated?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I graduated at the end of 2013.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Okay, so three years now in the work world.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Three years, yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And you're pursuing kind of a mustachioed, extreme savings type of approach to financial independence?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah, so my average savings rate is about 42%.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Awesome. That's fantastic.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So I've just been squirreling away as much as I possibly can.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And this is the time to do it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I'm young and single, and I don't have very many expenses.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So it's super easy.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You just set everything and forget it.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So I maxed out my 401(k), my Roth IRA, and this year I'll add in my HSA.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Congratulations.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So tell me what this looks like practically.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Because obviously a lot of people, they get out of college and they immediately start spending more than what they're earning.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So first, you're working in IT?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, I work in IT.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And do you disclose how much you're earning at this point in time?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I do, yeah.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   How much?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I started off at about $65,000.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now I'm up to about $76,000.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Okay, so first, that right there.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   The median income in the United States, I don't have this year's numbers.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The median household income where I was at was about $50,000.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You saved me.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You saved me with the right numbers.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So you come out making $10,000 more than the median income.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Which is like an average of two people's income, yeah.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Right, which is fantastic.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And that's due to choosing a career that is in high demand and where you actually need some skill and knowledge applied.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yep, yep.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So congratulations.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Congratulations there.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And when you got out of college and you have this idea to say, "I want to live inexpensively," what did you do?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Where do you live?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Do you have a car?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Tell me about kind of what your lifestyle looks like at this point.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So I gave myself three months to furnish a place because I had lived in a dorm for four years.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So I didn't have a bed.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I didn't have a dresser.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I didn't have a kitchen table, you know, so I had to fund everything.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So I set my 401(k) to just the match.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I get roughly 6% to 10% match depending on how you calculate it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And so I set it--
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And by the way, I'm going to interrupt you.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I don't remember we said where you're living.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I live in a very low cost area in the Midwest.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Okay, okay, very good.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So--
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So you set your 401(k) to just the match.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Set the 401(k) to just the match.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then I let myself spend whatever I needed to furnish my house.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But I didn't go crazy.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You know, I scoured state sales and Craigslist.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And I tried to buy used as much as possible.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And I got some great deals, Lazy Boy Couch for $150.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Nice.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I love that couch.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So then after three months, I jacked up my savings rate
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   as much as possible to max out my 401(k).
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And I actually made a mistake because I calculated my match as my contribution.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So at the end of the year, fair enough, sure enough,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   there was $18,000 in my account, but I had only contributed $13,000 of that.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Ah, so you could have--
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Missed out on some of that space.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Right, you could have put an extra five grand in.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Yeah, so if you're thinking about doing this,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   then make sure you exclude the match from your calculations
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   because that doesn't count towards your contribution.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Right, so just for clarity, you can put up--
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   is it this year, I guess $18,000 or is it $18,500?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   $18,000.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   $18,000 into your 401(k), but that's based upon your actual contribution.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Your employer can put in whatever the match is on top of that.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You're just limited to $18,000 in your 401(k).
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So I missed out on about $5,000 in tax.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   My audience is crying their eyes out.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Oh, no, you missed it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I know, right?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So terrible, $5,000, you poor thing.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yeah, so going from that, spending whatever I wanted on house stuff
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   and then cracking down, I was like, "Oh, wow, this is kind of hard to do."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And I was living in a pretty cheap place.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It was a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house for $950 a month.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Renting the whole house?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Renting the whole house, yep.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And it was about 1,500 square feet, something like that.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And I wasn't using all of it because, again, I didn't have very much stuff just starting out.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   So I got a roommate, and he paid half the rent,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and so that brought my housing costs down even more.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And I kept my car out of college, so I didn't immediately go and get a car
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   because I'm adulting, I have a paycheck, I can do that.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Adulting, that's the first time I've heard that.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   That's great.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's one of my least favorite phrases.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Millennials use it a lot.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's like, "Oh, I paid my bills today. #adulting."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I'm out of touch now.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I am a millennial, but I guess I'm in a different phase of life, so that's new to me.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah, so I kept those two expenses really low,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   getting a roommate and keeping my same car that was paid off.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   So I feel like that's really what helped me at the beginning
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   because I didn't have to worry about, "Oh, I have to pay $250 for my car payment today."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   But I could be putting that in my Roth IRA instead.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So instead of paying other people, I paid myself first.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Perfect.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, so if you're paying $900 to rent a three-bedroom, one-bath house,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   that drops you down to $450 plus utilities.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Yep.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And then no car payment, basic insurance costs, basic other costs.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Do you have any guess of what you spend at this point in time on a monthly basis?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   So in 2015, I spent about $39,000.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   In 2016, I spent $41,000.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Okay.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   So where is the excess money?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Are you spending it on travel or other things?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Travel--well, my housing costs went up significantly when I moved for my new job.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I went from paying $450 to paying $1057 a month plus utilities and everything.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So a good chunk of that went towards higher housing costs.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   So are you planning to do the same thing, get a roommate, lower those costs,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   or are you comfortable at this point in time with your situation?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I said I was comfortable because I moved very close to work.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I was a mile and a half away.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I could walk.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I could ride my bike.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   That cut down on transportation costs, which was nice.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   But now that I look back on it, I was like, "That's kind of dumb."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I really wanted to be close to work, and that was great,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   but it was a very expensive area of town.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And I could have lived 15 minutes away and saved a couple hundred bucks a month
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   by just living a little bit further away.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So now I slightly regret the fact that I spent like $14,000 in rent last year.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So I just moved for a new job a month and a half ago,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and I'm going to buy some multifamily rental property,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   but I moved in two weeks, so I didn't have time to find a place to stay.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   So it was either go with a very expensive short-term lease,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   or I put out a call on Facebook.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I said, "Hey, does anybody have any short-term housing options
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   that I can use for a couple of months?"
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And a friend of mine--because I moved back to my old town--
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   a friend of mine said, "Hey, I've got a giant empty basement
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and a really big mortgage payment.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It would be great if you could help me out and move into my basement."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And so I said, "Well, it would be great if you could help me out
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and let me live in your basement for cheap."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And so both of us think that we got better into the deal.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So now I live in a basement for $400 a month, all-inclusive.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Great.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And I get a garage, which is just amazing.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   In the Midwest is useful.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   In the winter, yes.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   No ice scraping.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   No ice scraping, no snow scraping.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   That's worth at least an extra $100 a month, right?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Absolutely.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Better lifestyle.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yes.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So how old are you now at this point?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm 26.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   You're 26.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And I haven't looked at your blog.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Do you disclose how much money you've saved?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I do, yeah.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   How much money you've saved based upon this process at this point
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and then what your plans are from here?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   So in three years, I've increased my net worth $115,000 to $125,000.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Congratulations.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And what's next from here?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Next, after Camp Mosh Dash is over, I will be talking to a realtor
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and looking in my area for multifamily rental options.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I want to get at least a triplex or preferably a quad.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Quad.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   That way I can live in one unit and rent out the others
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and have other people pay from a mortgage
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   so I don't even have a housing cost.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And instead of even having housing costs, I'm getting paid to live there
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   because people are paying me.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So it's house hacking.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So that's a great way to live very cheaply
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   and get some extra semi-passive income coming in.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So you're on this website, Fiery Millennials,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and we millennials are quite the buzz.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Not all the press is positive.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Tell me about your work and what you're trying to accomplish
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   in speaking to the millennial generation about money.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Yeah, so there are a lot of big-name bloggers out there,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and it turns out that most of them are older with families,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and they're either really close to financial independence
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   or they've been financially independent for a couple of years now.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And it's just not very relevant to a lot of young people's situations.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So I started this blog, and people reach out to me,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   and they're like, "Wow, you're going through the exact same stuff I am.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   This is useful information to know
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   because you're going through it at the same time I am."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   So I like to inspire people that it's actually possible,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   that we can do this crazy thing and retire way before normal.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Because you hear news articles, it's like, "Oh, millennials will never retire.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Inflation's going to happen, and you're not going to be able to save
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   because student debt is so high."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   But I want to prove that there are other options out there
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   and that you don't have to work until you're 70, 75.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Why do you want to retire?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I hate working.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Have you thought about getting a job that you don't hate?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Well, that would require me to lower my standards of living,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   which I'm not willing to do.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I did actually just so I got my new job,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and I thoroughly enjoy this job way more
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   than I did my last couple of positions.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   So I don't hate working quite so much anymore.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But it's still not doing fun things.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Growing up, I was heavily influenced by the Girl Scout organization,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and I ended up getting a lot of mentoring
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and a lot of stability out of that life.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So I want to mentor the next generation of girls coming up.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   But unfortunately, you can't really do that
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   unless you're available to work all summer at a Girl Scout camp
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and get paid like $600, $700, $800 for the entire summer.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So I want to be able to choose to do jobs that don't pay much
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   but are really fulfilling and really useful to people
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   or just really fun like being a ski instructor
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   out at Breckenridge for the winter.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Right, right.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   So a lot of--in the statement that you said, you said, "I hate working."
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   This is probably a common theme among many in the millennial generation,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and it drives other generations batty because they don't understand.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So what do you mean when you say, "I hate working"?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Why do you say that? What do you mean by that?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   So I hate getting up when it feels like -20 outside,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and I have to get up, and it's dark, and it's cold.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I just don't like getting up and being forced to do things
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   that I don't really care about.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   There's politics involved.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You have to play the game, and you have to climb the ladder,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and you just have to deal with a bunch of stuff that is,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   in the long run, useless and won't matter.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And I don't have time and energy to just have to care about all that stuff,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   so I don't want to care about it.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   So going to work and doing stuff that I don't really care about
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   is just kind of draining after a while.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   -Are you lazy? -Yes.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Straight-up answer. I'm working on it.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   It's one of my goals for 2017.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   For my goals post I put in there, yes, I am very lazy,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and I'm working very hard to fix this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   If I can procrastinate it, I will.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I'll put it off until the end of time, anything I can do.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But I'm working at doing it, recognizing, like,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "Oh, I'll just check this thing on Facebook."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   No, put the phone down, put Facebook away.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You have things to do right now. Get them done.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Get it done, get it over with before it becomes a bigger problem.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Like I wrote a post about how FI is like doing your dishes.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   The easier and quicker you do your dishes, the faster it goes.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So right after a meal, you just rinse it off. Boom. Easy done.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   You clean it, maybe throw some soap and water on it.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   All my dishes are clean. If you ever come over to my house, I promise, they're all clean.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But if you put it off, you just lay the plate next to the sink,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and you say, "Oh, I'll get to it later."
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Then all the food becomes hard and crusty, and it's a lot more work,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and then things grow on it, and it's gross, and it smells weird.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Same thing with FI.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   The longer you put off starting to save for retirement, the harder it gets.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Start off when we're young, it's a lot easier comparatively.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   So you have a goal of being financially independent as quickly as possible.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And your primary motivation, it sounds to me, is so that you can, number one,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   have control over the little details of your life.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   You don't have to get up when it's cold and go out of your house when it's dark to go to a job.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So you can--and I understand that.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   You can stay at home and get up and have a nice cup of coffee and look out at the snow
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   instead of having to go out in it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And also because you want to do work that is more meaningful to you,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   that is more in line with your own goals.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Is that an accurate summary?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Absolutely. Nailed it.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   So you see your exit path as save enough money that you could live on
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   so that you can switch to something else.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   So what's your target savings amount?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I believe it is somewhere in the--right over half a million dollars.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It's like $567,000 or something.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's kind of in flux.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I don't know what my expenses are, like what my base expenses are.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So I have an average of $40,000 a year, but will I actually spend that much more
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   now that I'm house hacking and I'll have things going forward?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   So I don't quite know.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So tell me--because your employer would very much like to engage you in a way that is deeper.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Your employer wants you--it's hard for me to believe that you're lazy.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I know you might--I think we all have things that we like to do that might be perceived that way.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   But if you spent six years working in the military, that means that you've had to undergo
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   a significant amount of discipline that's imposed upon you by that system.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   If you've successfully graduated from college with a degree in IT,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   that means that you have imposed upon yourself self-discipline enough to study and to do your work.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And if you have been able to go out into the working world and you're earning 75,000 bucks a year,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   you're not--I don't believe you're lazy.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I work hard--I force myself to work a lot harder than I should.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I should be working smarter, not harder.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Why?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Well, I put things off and it becomes harder and more difficult.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   But why do you think you should be working smarter, not harder?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Well, it would be easier to do that.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So by not being lazy, I could be lazy in the future.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   But you're not lazy.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Here's the thing, you're not lazy.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   So if you were--here's how it--if you were--I don't know.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   If you were going and working as a ski instructor now,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   or if you were going and working as a summer camp counselor now,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   and you lived in your car, then I might possibly believe that you're lazy.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But I don't believe that you're lazy.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I think that you just haven't been able to connect yet the sense of meaning and purpose with your job.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   And the reason I'm pushing on this is because it annoys me deeply
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   when people make generational stereotypes and characterizations of millennials as lazy.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   True.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Certainly, I think that we as millennials, we have our own problems,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   just like every generation has its problems.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   There is, it seems to me, too high of a sense of entitledness.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   There is, it seems to me, too high of a sense of specialness
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   when we're not all that special.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   We're people, just like billions of other people around the world.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The world doesn't revolve around us.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I think those are accurate characterizations that, of course, there are exceptions.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   But the one that annoys me is lazy,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   because I don't think most of the people that I know, most of the millennials that I know, are not lazy.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   My perspective on it is that millennials recognize that oftentimes our parents--
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and this is not personal to me, and I wouldn't put words in your mouth.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I'm speaking generally from observation of my generation.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Oftentimes, our parents have spent all this time working for--
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   let's talk about money and retirement.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Many of our parents have spent a lot of their time and their energy and their focus
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   of planning for their retirement, planning for their career, work, work, work, work, work.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Sure.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Put aside the fun, put aside the things that are meaningful.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   We'll get to that in retirement.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But the problem is that retirement is a pipe dream for the majority of the population.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   True.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   They don't have enough money.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   They're not going to save enough, and they're not going to have this golden retirement
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   that you see on the Merrill Lynch ads of a silver-haired couple walking down the beach
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   in Charleston, South Carolina, right in front of their beautiful coastal house
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   that looks like it belongs on the cover of Coastal Living.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Right.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   This is not going to happen.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Now, I think our generation, we look at that and say, "Well, that was dumb.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Why didn't you pursue a different plan?"
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Right.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And so you're pursuing a different plan.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   But you're saying that based upon the math of, as Mr. Money Mustache would put it,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   the seeding, shockingly simple math behind early retirement,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   if you just save a high enough percentage of your income, you can accumulate half a million dollars.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   If you keep your expenses low, then that may enable you to live on the income
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and it will give you more flexibility.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   But I don't think you're lazy because the type of person you have to be
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   to do that much work is not a lazy person.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I'm not afraid of doing hard work.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I've done a lot of hard work.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I don't shy away from it.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I mean, buying rental properties is very much hard work.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Absolutely.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's definitely not super passive income by any means, even though people term it as such.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I guess I see what else I do and I have the whole picture.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I love taking naps after work.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Sure.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It's my weakness.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   But this is normal.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   I cook for that.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Needing enough sleep is a normal thing.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So I'll leave the question there.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It's an interesting challenge.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Obviously, we have to look at personal situations
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and you can't stereotype too much a generation.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   But I do observe that that's a stereotype.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   It's a real management challenge for managers because in the business world,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   people who are managing millennials are oftentimes left saying, "What do I do?"
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   because millennials do not seem motivated by things that other generations were motivated by.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   For example, more money is, in general, less motivating to a millennial than is more autonomy.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Right.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Or the thing that I've been recognizing with a lot of my friends is a sense of doing good for the world.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Right.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   A lot of my friends don't want to work for the oil companies or whatever because of their impact on the earth
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and instead want to be in a position where they're doing good for the world.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Even if that means working at a nonprofit for less money,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   they'll feel better about what they're doing day in and day out and working towards that sense of purpose.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Right.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Which, ironically enough, I get through my company.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So that's why I'm very happy to work for them.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Because it's involved in something that's more meaningful.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Yes, because their mission statement isn't just making tons of cash.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's helping the people of the world.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Sure.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   So that was going to be where I was going to go next because here we're recording this
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   and tonight I'm giving a presentation to all of the attendees here at Camp Mustache.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And my presentation is titled "Why Wait to be Financially Independent to Live Like You're Financially Independent?"
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And the point of it is essentially to say that there's a way where you can get the benefits of financial independence
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   more quickly than just necessarily saying, "Let me wait until I save a million dollars."
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Right.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   So have you pursued, for example, the Girl Scouts of America needs IT personnel.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Have you ever considered going and pursuing a job with the Girl Scouts of America and their IT department?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I have looked into it, but I still have contacts in the Girl Scouts.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And not to disparage their organization by any means, but the local council is not a great environment to be in.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Even though their message is overall, "Do good for the girls."
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It's a little dicey sometimes.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   So tell me more about when millennials connect with you and your message.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   What are some of the emails that you get in terms of the meaning and the relevance of your message to the millennial situation?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I get, it kind of is 25/75.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   So 25% of the messages that I get are, "Oh my gosh, you're another girl going for financial independence."
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It's so refreshing to hear a woman speaking about this because overwhelming majority is male.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   So I get a lot of female bloggers that want to connect and be like, "Yes, this is great. I'm so excited to hear your voice."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And then the other 75% are, "Wow, this is really relevant and I'm so glad that you're writing because I'm going through this exact same thing."
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And I read your blog and I go, "Yes! This is what I've been thinking.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Like why can't my friend save $100 a month for retirement? It's so simple."
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Right, right.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   So first of all, do you have any idea about any data on the distinction between male bloggers, female bloggers in the personal finance space or in general?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Through my personal observation, it skews male but not overwhelmingly so I would say it's probably like 60/40 maybe.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Maybe 65/35.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Why do you think that is? What's your opinion?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I have no idea actually. I don't know.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Maybe because of the whole stereotype that men take care of the money and women take care of the home.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I don't know. I generally don't know.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Because there are studies that just came out that show that the overwhelming majority of millennial women have their finances in order and are saving well for retirement.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Whereas the millennial men who aren't doing so well at saving are bringing the numbers down.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So that's kind of ironic to me that there are so many male bloggers out there but yet overwhelmingly it's the females that pay more attention to finance.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Especially when they're young like we are.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Where are you hoping to go from here?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Well, I would like to start up buying some properties and getting that passive income coming in as I use my air quotes.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And then I just want to settle in my new job and really explore how that's going and dive in deep and do a really good job for them before I head out.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So I'm thinking sometime in the next three years I'll say I have enough, it's enough and that I'll be able to be financially independent and work on things that interest me more and inspire me more.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Right.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Alright, two last questions and then I'll have you tell about your blog.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Worst financial mistake or decision that you've made in your life thus far?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Probably the 401k honestly.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Yeah, that first year missing out.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Because I found financial independence so early I was able to read everybody's mistakes and avoid them and make my own mistakes.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Right.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   So yeah, that's probably the one thing that I beat myself up over.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Well, that's what you beat yourself up over.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   It's a great example of the value of education and standing on the shoulders of giants so that you can avoid the mistakes of other people.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Oh, it's totally true.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Yeah, I love that everybody's been writing about this stuff because I'm like, wow, I never would have thought that that would be a problem.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   That's great.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Best financial decision, investment, transaction, windfall that you've experienced thus far?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Probably the last month of income that I got in December of 2016.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Not only did I get a 10% raise for my new job, I got several moving allowances and a bonus.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So my normal salary is like $5,000 a month and then -- just a little over that actually -- and then I got $20,000, just over $20,000 worth of income in one month.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   That's awesome.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And I didn't go buy a new car.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   I didn't do anything with it.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   It's sitting in my bank account because it's for my down payment.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Congratulations.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So I'm pretty proud of having the discipline to say, oh, no, I don't need to go on the shopping spree and buy Armani clothes or whatever.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It's like, no, I'm just hanging on to it.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Good for you.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Tell all my listeners your website address, pitch what your content is, share any products or resources that you would like my listeners to be aware of, please.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So my blog is www.fierymillennials.com.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   This is obviously a play on the FIRE, F-I-R-E, Financial Independence Retire Early community.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Thank you for catching that.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   But also because people who meet me are just like blown away by my personality, which is also pretty fiery.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Right.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So that's a play on that as well.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But it's Fiery Millennials spelled like the campfire, F-I-E-R-Y, millennials.com.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I'm looking at my business card just to check.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   F-I-E-R-Y, yeah.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Yes.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And you're primarily writing with a millennial target audience?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Yep.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Yep.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Although some older people who are in the beginning stages of FI will also find it useful just for the general finance advice.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   One of the secret tools of teaching is oftentimes if you teach kids, you can teach parents or older people better.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Yep.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And they won't feel insulted by your kind of talk down to them.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   You just say, "Oh, I'm just teaching younger people."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   But all of a sudden now you can package your content in a way that it slides past people's filters and they learn something.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Yes.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   So it's aimed generally at those just graduating college or just starting their first jobs.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And as they face paying off their debt and figuring out, "Well, okay, I just paid off all my student loans.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   What do I do with this extra $600 a month now?"
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   It's like some people go out and spend it all on board games or whatever.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And then other people are like, "Oh, I should probably do something with this."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And then they look and they're like, "What to do with extra money?"
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And they come to our realm.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Right.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   That's awesome.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   So I want to inspire people to think that, "Wow, maybe early retirement is actually possible for me."
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Awesome.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Well, Gwen, thanks for coming on the show.
