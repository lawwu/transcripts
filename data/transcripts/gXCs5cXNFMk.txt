[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   Well, in John chapter 18, the ruler and the judge of all the earth was standing trial
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.380]   for his life.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.080]   Pontius Pilate was questioning Jesus about why the Jews would want to put him to death.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.840]   In verse 37 of John chapter 18, Pilate asked Jesus, "Did you really consider yourself a
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.840]   king?
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.840]   Are you sure that you're a king?"
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.520]   And Jesus responds with this remarkable declaration, "You say correctly that I am a king.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.960]   For this I have been born and for this I have come into the world to testify to the truth.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.160]   Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   Pilate heard Jesus' emphasis on the truth and he responded with a question.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.600]   Maybe he was asking rhetorically or dismissively, but certainly incredulously, John 18, 38.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.420]   What is truth?
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.200]   May not be an exaggeration to say that no one has ever asked a more fundamental question
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400]   than that.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.920]   What is truth?
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.440]   In every era of human history, people have wrestled with the nature of the truth, and
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.960]   rightly so, necessarily so.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.540]   The truth speaks not merely of that which is true, but of the standard itself by which
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.080]   all truth claims are measured.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.280]   Concept of truth is absolutely foundational to the concept of knowledge itself.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.400]   What we know, as well as how we know what we know, depends on our understanding of the
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.520]   nature of the truth.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.720]   The truth is what distinguishes the genuine from the counterfeit.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.240]   Is this a true $100 bill or is it fake?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.480]   It's what separates fact from fiction.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.360]   Is this a true story or is it just a myth?
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.160]   It's what separates reality from fantasy.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.720]   Is this truly happening or am I dreaming?
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.600]   It even separates the moral from the immoral.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400]   Is this the truth or is it a lie?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.640]   In Pastor John's book, "The Truth War," he writes on the first page, "Every idea we have,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.840]   every relationship we cultivate, every belief we cherish, every fact we know, every argument
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.880]   we make, every conversation we engage in, and every thought we think presupposes that
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   there is such a thing as truth."
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.480]   The idea is an essential concept without which the human mind couldn't function.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.000]   And yet, as fundamental as the truth is to every aspect of human thought, there has been
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.520]   historically and there is today widespread confusion regarding the very notion of truth
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   itself.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.920]   Three different approaches to the concept of truth characterize the three broad epics
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680]   of history.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.360]   In the era of premodernism, which spans from the beginning of civilization through the
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.600]   mid-17th century, it was generally accepted that truth could be known and that any truth
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   that was known was given by divine revelation.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.000]   Whether the true God of the Bible or any combination of false deities from the pantheons of the
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.500]   pagans, premodern peoples believed that only a being with knowledge that transcended human
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.440]   limitations could reliably reveal objective truth to mankind.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.340]   The era of modernism, which runs from around 1685 to 1989, was spawned by the so-called
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.320]   Enlightenment of the 16th and 17th centuries.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.200]   There were great strides being made in scientific discovery and man's understanding of the natural
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.700]   world and the result was that mankind became overly impressed with his own intellect.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.200]   Philosophical advances caused thinkers to become skeptical of religious claims, skeptical
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   of the reliability of the Scriptures, skeptical even of the very existence of God.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.460]   Reason replaced religion and philosophical rationalism demanded the rejection of claims
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.920]   that couldn't be squared with the reasoning of modernity.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   The test of truth became whether it was rational, whether it made sense, which is a good canon
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.020]   as far as it goes.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.740]   Problem is, when it's divorced from the Bible and when it's subjected to the natural fallen
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.020]   human mind, it leaves no room for the supernatural claims of the Gospels.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.860]   A virgin-born, miracle-working, prophecy-fulfilling Savior who bore the sins of His people and
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.520]   the wrath of His God by His death and rose bodily on the third day simply could not surmount
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.960]   the bar of naturalist rationalism.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.660]   Then into the 19th century, further scientific advancements along with the Industrial Revolution
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.080]   gave birth to positivism, which was a form of empiricism that held truth could be known
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.400]   through the scientific method.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   If we design well-run experiments and if we make the proper observations and inferences
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.240]   on the basis of the data, we can know what's true.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   In short, modernism held that man was able to discern truth for himself through what
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.740]   he could observe with his senses and what he could understand by his reasoning.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.720]   But the 19th century seemingly unbounded optimism in mankind's limitless potential was followed
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.780]   by the bloodiest century in the history of the world, two world wars, the consistent
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.060]   threat of nuclear destruction, the emergence of several dictators throughout the world.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.880]   That all provided a more realistic view of human nature.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.120]   All the philosophical and scientific advancements of the Enlightenment, all of the innovation
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.400]   of the Industrial Revolution only led to devastation and suffering.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.240]   And with the fall of the Soviet Union, typified by the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.280]   November 1989, the modernist era gave way to what has been called postmodernism.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.860]   Premodernism held truth could be known by divine revelation.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.320]   Modernism held that truth could be known by the rigorous testing of the natural world
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.200]   and making rational deductions.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.100]   But postmodernism is doubtful that absolute truth can be known at all.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.700]   Some versions of postmodern thought allow for the existence of objective truth but they
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.480]   rather dogmatically reject the notion that human beings can arrive at such truth with
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.280]   any certainty.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.000]   They're quite certain that no one can be certain of anything.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   Sure, there may be truth out there somewhere but it's far beyond our ability to comprehend.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.360]   But then there's another stripe of postmodernism that's becoming increasingly popular which
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.520]   asserts again rather certainly that absolute truth does not exist at all and all truth
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.680]   claims basically boil down to mere opinions.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.760]   And in these days of critical theory and cultural Marxism, it's become popular to say that those
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.640]   claiming to speak truth are just persons from privileged groups aiming to impose their opinions
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.720]   and preferences upon marginalized groups so that the privileged oppressor classes can
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.480]   preserve their own power and influence over the oppressed.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:07.960]   When you look at the world today, it doesn't seem that truth is triumphing.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.880]   Illustrations of the postmodern rejection of truth are ever present.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.360]   A couple of years ago, a conservative apologetics ministry produced a video series called Road
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.320]   Trip to Truth and they traveled to local university campuses and interviewed college students
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.620]   about their views on truth and morality and authority.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.100]   And then they invited Christian professors and theologians to offer biblical responses
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.840]   to the students' claims.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.360]   And though they asked these students questions on a variety of topics, there was one question
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:45.760]   they always asked everyone, whether they believed that absolute objective truth exists.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.520]   And almost every one of them said no.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.280]   You may have your truth, but I have my truth.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.800]   And if my truth contradicts your truth, how could either of us be so arrogant and oppressive
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.160]   as to claim that one of us must subject our truth to the other person's truth?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.360]   One young man who was interviewed even said, "Anything can be true, even a lie, if enough
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   people believe in it."
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.200]   Now that is not consistent with reality, but it is consistent with postmodernism's rejection
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.800]   of absolute truth, which is to say postmodernism is not consistent with reality.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.280]   You see, if there is no objective standard by which we can measure truth claims, both
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:40.040]   morality and reality descend into pure subjectivism, and the result is absurdity.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.600]   For example, if we can't say that there is an objective standard by which to judge an
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   action to be truly good or evil, then morality itself is denigrated into nothing more than
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.000]   competing personal preferences.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.960]   It's popular today for people to say that morality is subjective, that it's socially
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.240]   constructed.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.200]   Certain societies sort of socially contract an agreement upon certain things that are
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.560]   virtues and others that are vices.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:12.960]   But what falls into what category differs from culture to culture and across time.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.920]   But if that were true, if morality were subjective and socially constructed, by what consistent
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:29.460]   standard could we condemn the evils of chattel slavery, or of the Holocaust, or of race-based
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.520]   segregation laws?
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.080]   Were not the societies of antebellum America, Nazi Germany, and the Jim Crow South living
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.380]   their truth?
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.880]   If truth were nothing other than a social contract where certain values, we people just
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.480]   decide that certain values are right and others are wrong, who are we to tell the Nazis their
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.980]   culture was wrong?
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.640]   Wouldn't that just be us arrogantly trying to force our own worldview and moral standards
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.600]   upon others?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.960]   If there were no such thing as absolute truth, we couldn't consistently say, "It is absolutely
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.680]   true that it is always wrong to kidnap people and enslave them as if they were property."
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.100]   The most a consistent post-modernist could say is, "I find race-based chattel slavery
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.600]   to be unpleasant, and I don't think it should be allowed.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.720]   But I can't say that it's always wrong in all cultures.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.800]   It could be morally right if enough people agree that it is."
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.120]   And those students in that video series on those campuses said that very thing.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.360]   Well, I guess the Nazis' culture agreed on it.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.280]   No clear-thinking person would ever dream of saying anything like that.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   It is absolutely true that slavery, the Holocaust, segregation were moral evils in every society
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.880]   no matter what the majority agreed upon.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.760]   But you see, when a consistent application of your worldview prohibits you from denouncing
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.640]   such obvious wrongdoing as objectively evil, your worldview has been proven wrong.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.920]   It can't account for reality.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   And that's where I'm going next.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   The post-modern theory of truth not only upends morality, but it undoes reality itself.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.960]   Matters of fact are reduced to mere opinions.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.080]   You know, sure, you believe the Bible, but I believe the Koran, or I believe the Talmud,
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   or I believe the Bhagavad Gita.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.420]   Well yes, I understand that we believe different things, but it doesn't matter what we believe,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.560]   it matters whether what we believe is true.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.400]   Well we can both be right.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.480]   Well no, we can't both be right because we're making mutually exclusive truth claims.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.520]   And if mutually exclusive truth claims can both be right, well then we would transgress
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.520]   a fundamental axiom of all rational thought, which is the law of non-contradiction.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.800]   The law of non-contradiction states that a truth claim, call it A, and the negation of
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.240]   that truth claim, call it not A, can't both be true at the same time and in the same relationship.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.820]   The law of non-contradiction is that A and not A cannot both be true at the same time
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.240]   and in the same relationship.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.320]   And if that is not a sound principle of thought, we lose all rational basis for knowledge and
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.960]   nothing means anything.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.920]   If you are listening to this sermon and you are not listening to this sermon can both
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:37.520]   be true at the same time and in the same sense, then there is no consistent logical basis
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.400]   for either statement.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.280]   The statement, even a lie can be true.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:51.120]   If that's true, then that statement can be a lie and there's no reason to believe it.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.640]   Thought and communication are rendered impossible.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.000]   The claim, "There is no absolute truth," is itself an absolute statement.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.640]   There's as much rational basis for using words to say, "There's no such thing as words."
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.280]   Saying it proves that it's false.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.520]   You should always ask somebody who claims there's no absolute truth if it's absolutely
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.400]   true that there's no absolute truth.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.140]   Because you see, if it is absolutely true that there is no absolute truth, then there
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.080]   is absolute truth.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.840]   And if it's not absolutely true that there is no absolute truth, then there is absolute
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   truth.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.520]   If the claim is true, it's false.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.200]   Now of course, not everybody who makes these self-defeating arguments openly embraces the
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.960]   absurd conclusions that necessarily follow from them.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.320]   The point is simply that when a consistent application of your worldview leads to the
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.540]   absurd denial of reality or to self-defeating and contradictory claims, it's a surefire
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.920]   indication that your worldview has failed.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.340]   And that is where our society lives right now.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:10.800]   The choice has always been the God of the Bible or absurdity.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.720]   And our culture has long ago rejected the triune God of the Bible and they are coming
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.760]   down now to the end of the slide of absurdity.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   The consistent outworking of that rejection of God was the choice of the absurd, of self-contradiction,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.880]   of fantastical denial of reality.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.720]   And at the present time, there's no greater popular level illustration of post-modernism's
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.180]   descent into absurdity than the transgender movement.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.680]   There is no more brazen denial of reality than to suggest that a man can be a woman
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.800]   if he feels like it.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.320]   Not long ago, the notion of a pregnant man was a comedic fantasy.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.600]   Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger made a movie about it in 1994.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.960]   It was called Juniors.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.600]   Schwarzenegger gets pregnant.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000]   Everybody understands it's a joke, right?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   It's make-believe.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   It's like Santa Claus.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.260]   Today, 30 years later, that's it, 30 years later, if you deny that men can get pregnant,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.540]   you're a transphobic bigot who should be banished from the public square, who should lose your
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:22.300]   job, who shouldn't be welcomed into polite society.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.100]   When the newest Supreme Court Justice, Kintagi Brown Jackson, was being interviewed for the
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.060]   position by Congress, she was asked whether she could give a definition of the term "woman."
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.620]   She said she couldn't because she wasn't a biologist.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.780]   What is that but the consistent application of a denial of the absolute truths of basic
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.780]   biology?
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.140]   In fact, in a recent documentary called What is a Woman?, a conservative commentator interviews
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:54.300]   several people who've embraced transgender ideology seeking an answer to that very question.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.020]   If you can be a woman, if you feel like it, what is a woman then?
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.460]   And during one interview with a gender studies professor, he says that, the interviewer says,
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.900]   he wants to get to "get to the truth."
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:16.900]   And the professor responds, "I'm really uncomfortable with that language.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.140]   It sounds deeply transphobic to me."
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.460]   Then the professor threatens to stop the interview saying, "You keep invoking the word truth,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.580]   which is condescending and rude."
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:39.960]   You see, truth is inimical to those who wish to embrace absurdity and deny reality.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.220]   And they recognize it.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.880]   You keep talking about truth and we're going to stop the interview.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.580]   But it's not that truth is transphobic.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:18:02.420]   It's that trans is truthphobic.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.140]   I don't mean to be triumphalistic about that.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.080]   I mean to take the mask off of the lies.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.260]   Why is our society so eager to embrace transgenderism?
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.460]   You ever ask yourself that question?
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.780]   It's not as if there's a huge transgender constituency in the United States.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:28.060]   The entire LGBTQ population in America is still estimated to be only a little over 7%.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.540]   Why is the transgender cause part of the Democratic Party platform when it embraces only 1 to
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.460]   2% of all Americans?
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:44.700]   See, our society is so eager to embrace transgenderism because it is so eager to deny the absolute
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:51.280]   truth and the objective standard of morality that are incompatible with transgenderism,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.980]   that relegate transgenderism to the realm of the delusional and condemn it as immoral.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.820]   And why would that be?
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.420]   Paul writes in Romans 1:18, "God's wrath is revealed from heaven against sinners who suppress
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.940]   the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.220]   You see, the truth has been sufficiently revealed to mankind.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.540]   Romans 1:19, "God has made it evident to them," and verse 20, "His attributes have been clearly
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.980]   seen through what's been made so that men are without excuse."
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.820]   And if they were to admit that there is an objective standard of truth, they would be
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:33.660]   forced to admit that every one of us is accountable to the God of truth, whose law condemns them
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:39.780]   for their own sins, whatever those sins may be.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.740]   And so they suppress the truth of the very existence of truth.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:51.300]   If there's an absolute standard by which transgender perversion is judged to be immoral, well then
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:57.920]   there's an absolute standard by which my perversion, whatever it is, could be judged to be immoral.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.380]   I'm accountable to the God whose law sets that standard.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.660]   No, no, no, no, that can't be.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:13.300]   Sure, men can be women, anything, so long as I can sin in peace, so long as I can sin
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.780]   without the pangs of a conscience informed by the Word of God.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.540]   Transgender ideology isn't pressed on us solely by transgender people.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:30.140]   In many cases, they're the victims of a corrupt society seeking to undermine the foundations
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:38.300]   of truth, not to serve those folks, but to serve their own sinfulness.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:45.380]   Jesus explains the phenomenon in John 3, 19 to 21, this is the judgment that light has
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.100]   come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   Why?
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.500]   For their deeds were evil.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.900]   For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:01.740]   his deeds will be exposed, but he who practices the truth comes to the light so that his deeds
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.680]   may be manifested as having been wrought in God.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.620]   People reject the truth, both that which is true and the standard of truth itself, not
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.680]   for intellectual reasons, it's intellectually bankrupt, if it's true, it's false, right?
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.020]   But for moral reasons.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.460]   Pastor John says again in the Truth War, "Sinners love their sin, so they flee from the light
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.620]   denying that it even exists."
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.500]   Now straight talk like this is no longer tolerated, right?
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:36.420]   The culture that castigates you for not being tolerant of drag queen story hour simply will
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.240]   not tolerate being told the truth.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:47.180]   It's derided as unloving and anything that is unloving is violently opposed to the ethic
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:53.860]   of Jesus who preached that love was to be his followers' cardinal virtue.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.940]   Love is love, they shouted us rather unlovingly.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:08.980]   Well, yes, love is love, but love, 1 Corinthians 13:6, does not rejoice in unrighteousness
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:16.640]   but rejoices with the truth, which means that a culture that revels in unrighteousness and
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:26.540]   rejects even the existence of truth can have absolutely no idea what love is.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.820]   Love and truth are inextricably bound together.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:35.580]   They're bound inextricably in the nature of God himself, Exodus 34, 6, "Yahweh God, compassionate
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:42.900]   and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness and truth."
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.300]   They're bound inextricably as the sustenance of the worshiper of God, Psalm 40, verse 11,
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.140]   "You, oh Yahweh, will not withhold your compassion from me.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:58.880]   Your loving kindness and your truth will continually preserve me."
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.340]   They're bound inextricably in the Christian's life of conformity to Christ's likeness, Ephesians
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:10.980]   4, 15, "But speaking the truth in love," literally truthing in love, "we are to grow up in all
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.540]   aspects into him who is the head, even Christ."
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.860]   And they're bound inextricably as the sphere in which the Christian life exists, 2 John,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.460]   verse 3, "Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.100]   Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love."
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:38.900]   You can't separate love from truth, and any society that rejects the truth will inevitably
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:44.240]   find itself not only unloving, but in chaos.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.480]   And one telltale sign of such chaos is that they celebrate hatred as if it were love,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.660]   and they denounce love as if it were hatred.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:59.060]   They call evil good and good evil.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.140]   Homosexuality and transgenderism are soul-destroying perversions.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.820]   Again, you don't say that triumphalistically.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.980]   You can say the truth unlovingly, of course, but that's not what we're aiming at.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:18.500]   The truth of the matter is that if not repented of, those sins, those pattern of sins, just
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:25.300]   like your precious pet sins, end in eternal punishment if not turned from.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:35.220]   And affirming or celebrating or even refusing to warn against such sins is evidence of hatred.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:41.300]   Maybe malicious, maybe just cowardly, but it's not love.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.020]   It is not love to see someone careening toward a cliff, and because they're having the time
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:51.180]   of their lives in that car on the way to that cliff, you say, "Oh, I wouldn't want to interrupt
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   their fun.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.460]   Look how they're enjoying themselves.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.420]   I don't want to get in between them and that."
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.620]   That's a level of apathy that really only deserves the name hatred.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:09.340]   It's in fact self-love that refuses to incur the ire of sinners because we don't want them
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.540]   to be mad at us for telling them what they're doing is wrong.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.460]   "The world can't receive me."
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   Why?
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.760]   "Because I testify of it that its deeds are evil."
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:29.300]   We love like Jesus loves when we warn of sin's mortal danger and proclaim the gospel of truth
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   by which sinners can be rescued.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:40.020]   And so, my fellow ministers, don't be deterred from issuing those warnings and proclaiming
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.620]   that gospel because of accusations that you're just full of hate.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:51.940]   Don't be full of hate, but don't fall for the trick that if you say the truth, you're
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.460]   automatically hateful.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.400]   Should be no surprise to us that a culture that has no idea what love is also has no
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.620]   idea what hate is and sees the loving act of truth-telling as hatred.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:11.180]   When you reject the truth, all you can do is accuse as hateful those who would dare
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.620]   disturb your delusion.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.700]   So what do we do with all that?
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.740]   We live in this world that is under God's judgment to such a degree that they've been
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.660]   given over to a reprobate mind, to a mind that doesn't function, to such a degree that
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.900]   they've embraced this failed worldview of post-modernism, have denied reality and have
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.780]   descended into absurdity.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   So what?
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:43.420]   Well, friends, it's not enough to diagnose the problem.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.300]   It's not enough to accurately discern it.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:53.420]   It's not enough to lament it or decry it or mock it and then long wistfully and nostalgically
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.840]   for the good old days.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.180]   And yet neither is the proper course to coddle post-modernism's uneasiness with truth by
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:07.460]   toning down the definitive and right-angled claims of the biblical worldview, by trying
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:13.020]   to compromise in order to contextualize the gospel to a culture that has set itself against
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.180]   the very fundamentals of knowledge and rational thought.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:24.380]   No, the proper response is not to compromise with the culture nor to retreat from the culture.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.880]   The proper response is to boldly confront the culture by unashamedly proclaiming the
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.140]   truth that triumphs, the truth of biblical Christianity.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.560]   Understand you are here and where you are when you will not be here, when you return
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:46.040]   home later this week, to be the salt of the earth.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.760]   We are here to be that preserving and seasoning influence upon a world that is rotting and
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.620]   decaying.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.940]   We're here in 2024 to be the light of the world.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:03.260]   We're to shine forth the light of the truth into a world that is lost in darkness.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.020]   And you remember, salt that isn't salty is useless.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.660]   No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:15.460]   And so we need to be equipped to engage these errors with the word of the living God.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:22.660]   So let us resolve to be salt and light to this dying culture by graciously yet boldly
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:29.100]   confronting its lies with the truth of Christ and Him crucified, and by training the saints
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.680]   we are responsible for to do the same thing.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.100]   And that starts by considering how supremely central the concept of truth is for the Christian
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:44.100]   worldview, especially against the backdrop of a society that's rejected truth altogether.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.700]   In an effort to equip us to do that, I want us to consider five pillars of the truth of
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.340]   the Christian worldview.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.460]   Five pillars of the truth of the Christian worldview so that we might be able to sound
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:01.960]   forth to the world and to the church a clear answer to Pilate's question, "What is truth?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.420]   What is truth?"
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.740]   First, consider the value of truth.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.500]   The value of truth.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:18.020]   So far from finding the concept of truth to be offensive or rude or condescending, absolute
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.100]   truth is essential to the Christian worldview.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   What is truth?
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.740]   First of all, it is inestimably valuable.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:34.900]   Proverbs 23, 23, "The sage exhorts those who would gain wisdom to buy truth and do not
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.660]   sell it."
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.020]   Truth isn't a stock you get into, get a little bit, it goes up, okay, sell it quick and make
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.020]   a profit.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.180]   No, this one is one you hold on to.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.000]   Buy truth and do not sell it.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.940]   Truth is to be regarded by Christians to be such a precious treasure that we exhaust all
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:59.440]   lawful means to get a hold of it, and once we've got it, to never let it go.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.860]   By nature, all mankind is born in captivity, enslaved to sin and doomed to reap its deadly
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.860]   consequences.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:14.460]   But John 8, 31 and 32, Jesus says, "The truth will free us from the bondage of sin and death.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:20.040]   If you continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine and you will know the truth
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.720]   and the truth will make you free."
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.800]   Without the truth, we lie helpless in our slavery.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.400]   Just several verses after that, John 8, 44, Jesus says, "The truth stands in mortal conflict
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.000]   with Satan.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.180]   The devil does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.520]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.280]   of lies."
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.200]   So lies are satanic and evil and wicked.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.320]   Truth stands against such wickedness.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.280]   The teams are clear, aren't they?
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:06.940]   Satan and lies on this side, God and the truth on this side.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:15.520]   When you hear criticisms of truth as a concept, guess which team that's coming from.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.720]   And then as a result, to stand against the truth is to court the wrath and indignation
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   of God.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.340]   In Romans 2, Paul speaks of the righteous judgment of God who will render to each person
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.920]   according to his deeds.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   Romans 2, 8, "Those who do not obey the truth will receive a judgment of wrath and indignation."
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:41.000]   In Thessalonians 2, 10, Paul characterizes the followers of Jesus as those who received
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.880]   the love of the truth so as to be saved.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.580]   If you're going to be saved from sin and the judgment to come, you have to be one who loves
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.680]   the truth.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.800]   And then similar to the comment in Romans 2, he says, "Those who don't love the truth
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.120]   will perish under the judgment of God."
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.140]   So essential is the truth to Christianity that Christ himself summarizes the entire
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.680]   purpose for his incarnation and mission from heaven in terms of the truth.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.860]   It was the verse I began with, John 18, 37, "For this I have been born and for this I
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.720]   have come into the world to testify to the truth.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.320]   Everyone who's of the truth hears my voice."
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.080]   Now, who hears the shepherd's voice?
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.920]   Romans 1, 10, "Those sheep who were given to him by the Father, out of whose hand no
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.560]   one can snatch them."
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.880]   The elect hear his voice.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.200]   And so here's another instance in which the people of God are defined as those who are
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.040]   of the truth.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.580]   First Timothy 3, 15, "The church is the pillar and support of the truth."
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.600]   And 2 Corinthians 13, 8, "Truly a text for our times."
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.640]   You talk about binding words on your forehead and putting them as frontals in Deuteronomy
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   6.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   Here's a text for us.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   Paul says of true believers, "We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth."
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.960]   That is your motto.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.520]   We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.880]   Why can't you just call him the name he wants to be called?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.000]   Why can't you just use his preferred pronouns?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.880]   Why can't you just attend the wedding?
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:32.240]   Because we can do nothing against the truth and reinforcing someone's delusion like that
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.400]   is acting against the truth.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.840]   It is impossible to exaggerate the centrality of the concept of truth with respect to Christianity.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   These passages show that Jesus and the apostles saw the truth as identical to Christianity
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.440]   itself.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.680]   But more than the system of Christianity or the Christian worldview, Scripture goes on
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.200]   to identify the truth with the nature of God himself.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.760]   That brings us to our second point, not only the value of truth, but number two, the God
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.720]   of truth.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.080]   In Psalm 31, 5, David prays to God for rescue from his persecutors and he writes, "Into
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.220]   your hand I commit my spirit.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:21.920]   You have ransomed me, O Yahweh, God of truth."
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.080]   Isaiah repeats that title for God in the latter portion of his prophecy, Isaiah 65, 16, "He
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.640]   who is blessed in the earth will be blessed by the God of truth, and he who swears in
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.520]   the earth will swear by the God of truth."
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.000]   This is who God is.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.560]   There's no middle ground.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.920]   There's no way to be antagonistic to the idea of truth while also not being antagonistic
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.280]   to the idea of God.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:56.160]   If you don't like the truth, you don't like God.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.440]   And further than that, since God is a trinity, since the Bible reveals one God subsisting
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:08.140]   in three coequal consubstantial persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Scripture identifies
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.680]   each person of the trinity with the truth.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:18.480]   John 7, 28, Jesus speaks of the Father when he says, "He who sent me is true."
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.240]   John 14, 6, we learn the Son is truth incarnate.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:28.160]   Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.680]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:37.240]   And then we hear the same thing of the Holy Spirit in 1 John 5, 6, "The Spirit is the
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.200]   truth."
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.240]   What is truth then?
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.060]   In short, the triune God is the truth.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.040]   Speaking metaphysically, Yahweh is the one true God, the only genuine God that exists
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.440]   as opposed to the counterfeit deities of the pagan nations, right?
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:01.640]   The Thessalonians turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.180]   Speaking logically, the God of the Bible is incapable of erring or being mistaken for
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:13.240]   his understanding is infinite, Psalm 147, 5, and he knows all things as they actually
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.960]   are, 1 John 3, 20.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   And then speaking ethically, the triune God is opposed to all lies and deceit and duplicity.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:30.280]   He is, Titus 1, 2, the God who cannot lie, who is perfectly and unfailingly faithful,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.320]   whose faithfulness reaches to the skies, Psalm 36, 5.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.820]   Hermann Bavink said, "God is the truth in its absolute fullness.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:47.320]   He therefore is the primary, the original truth, the source of all truth, the truth
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   in all truth."
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.600]   What is truth?
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.160]   Truth is that which is consistent with the mind of the triune God of truth.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.400]   And the culture is in chaos because its people have rejected this God from being Lord over
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.760]   them and they've exalted themselves in his place.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.480]   They've exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.720]   than the creator.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.880]   And God has graciously revealed his mind to mankind through the inerrant scriptures, the
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.600]   66 books of the Old and New Testaments.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.260]   That brings us thirdly to the word of truth, to the word of truth.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.280]   Because God is the God of truth who cannot lie, his words which he has breathed forth
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   into the pages of the Bible by the agency of human authors, those words are pure and
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.560]   unalloyed truth.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.360]   2 Samuel 7, after God gives the Davidic covenant promise, David responds to that revelation
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:38:01.040]   by declaring, 2 Samuel 7, 28, "Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God and your words are truth."
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.360]   Proverbs 30 in verse 5 says, "Every word of God proves true."
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.320]   And then Psalm 119, 160 says, "The sum of your words is truth."
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.160]   Both individually and collectively then, we must confess what Jesus says to the Father
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.280]   in John 17, 17, "Your word is truth."
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:28.860]   The word of God, the inerrant scriptures are not merely true as if their content happens
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.320]   to cohere with an external standard of truth.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.640]   No, as an expression of God's own nature and mind, God's word is truth itself.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.960]   It's the very standard by which all truth claims are to be measured.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.560]   It is, as 2 Timothy 2, 15 says, the word of truth, which is to be accurately handled by
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.880]   the servants of God who labor in preaching and teaching.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   And so if anyone desires to know the truth, they must measure every truth claim against
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.960]   the teaching of the Bible.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.680]   What is truth?
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.760]   Truth is that which is consistent with the word of God as revealed in the inerrant and
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.720]   sufficient scriptures.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:14.640]   And the culture is in chaos because it's rejected God's unchanging word and has exalted in its
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:22.400]   place man's own twisted reasoning and fluctuating feelings.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.520]   And what's the message of those scriptures?
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:30.720]   That brings us number four, to the gospel of truth, the gospel of truth.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.800]   The Bible is the word of truth, but the central message communicated to mankind in the Bible
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the good news of forgiveness of sins by grace alone, through
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.760]   faith alone, in Christ alone, apart from works.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.960]   It is the message that although all people have sinned and fall short of the glorious
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.320]   standard of perfection that a holy God demands for fellowship with him, nevertheless, God
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.160]   the Son took on a human nature so that he could live and die in the place of the people
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:09.120]   his father had given him to accomplish their righteousness and to pay for their sins.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:14.440]   And then having risen from the grave in victory, he welcomes all to lay hold of the forgiveness
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.000]   through repentant faith in him alone.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And so I say to you who are here this morning, and yet remain a stranger to God's grace,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.800]   today is the day to turn away from your sins, to turn away from the absurdity and fruitlessness
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:39.160]   of a failed worldview and a righteousness which cannot surmount the bar of God's justice.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:45.120]   And then to trust with your whole heart in the blood and righteousness of Jesus for rescue
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.720]   from that just judgment of God.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:55.480]   Repent and trust in Christ this morning, you who do not yet know the sweetness of justifying
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.180]   grace.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:04.800]   That message, the gospel of your salvation, is called in Ephesians 1.13 the message of
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.400]   the truth.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:15.440]   In Psalms 69.13, David speaks of the "saving truth of God."
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.660]   Galatians 2, Paul speaks twice of the truth of the gospel.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:25.240]   And in Colossians 1.5 and 6, he says the gospel is that word of truth that bears fruit throughout
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.360]   the world.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.920]   James 1.18, James says the same word of truth, the gospel, is what brings sinners forth out
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.000]   of death unto spiritual life.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.280]   You're regenerated by the gospel of truth.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.800]   And the gospel of truth is exclusive.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.440]   The apostles declare in Acts 4.12, "There is salvation in no one else, for there is
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.520]   no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:59.640]   John 14.6 again, "I am the truth and no one comes to the Father but by me."
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:08.040]   That means every other proposed way to God, every other religion, every other philosophy,
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:15.360]   every other way of life in the history of the world stands opposed to the truth.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.280]   Christ alone is the door of the sheep.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.680]   All others are thieves and robbers.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.380]   What is truth?
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.200]   Truth is that which is consistent with the gospel of salvation by grace alone through
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.600]   faith alone in Christ alone.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.000]   The culture is in chaos because it has rejected this wonderful news.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:43.760]   Light has come into the world but men love darkness because their deeds are evil.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.520]   Now to say that truth is what corresponds to the mind of God is to say that truth is
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.580]   that which corresponds to reality.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:43:00.720]   This is because God, who possesses all knowledge and perfect wisdom, can't know what's false.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.320]   He can't say, "I know this," and it not really be so.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.440]   He can't be mistaken.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.880]   Reality itself is a result of God's universal decree whereby He has ordained whatsoever
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   comes to pass.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.800]   And so God can never be deceived or mistaken or misled and therefore His mind is identical
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.600]   to reality as it is.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.560]   This brings us, number five, to the reality of truth.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   The reality of truth.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.480]   It means that truth is that which corresponds to reality.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:41.400]   Nothing can be true that manifestly contradicts what is real.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.120]   That's actually called the correspondence theory of truth.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.760]   And, of course, no text of Scripture explicitly says the people of God subscribe to the correspondence
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.160]   theory of truth.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.560]   Perhaps it presupposes the correspondence theory of truth on every page.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:03.380]   So for example, Proverbs 12, 17 states, "He who speaks truth tells what is right, but
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.000]   a false witness deceit."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.520]   What does it mean for a false witness to speak deceitfully?
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   Well, it means he testifies of a version of events that does not comport with reality.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.540]   He claims words were spoken which weren't spoken or that events took place which didn't
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.240]   take place.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:31.360]   His testimony does not correspond with reality and so it's not the truth.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:36.840]   By contrast, the witness who speaks truth tells what is right, which means what?
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.940]   That he reports words and events as they really happened.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:47.660]   His testimony of the truth corresponds to reality.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:52.340]   Another example comes from Paul's testimony to Festus in Acts 26.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.620]   As Paul testified to the suffering and resurrection of Christ as predicted in the Old Testament
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.180]   Scriptures, Festus accuses Paul of being insane.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.760]   Acts 26, 24, "Paul, you're out of your mind.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.620]   Your great learning is driving you mad."
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:11.060]   My students tell me that sometimes.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:18.060]   But Paul responds, "I am not out of my mind, but I utter words of sober truth."
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:24.740]   You see, a man who's out of his mind mistakes fantasy for reality.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.700]   He believes things that are not so.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.580]   But the truth here is sharply contrasted with falsehood and fantasy.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.420]   The truth is sober.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.300]   The truth is consistent with reality as it is.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:45.940]   Similarly, Titus 1, 14 says, "Those who turn away from the truth pay attention to myths
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.860]   and commandments of men."
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.640]   This means that the truth is neither man-made nor mythical.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.740]   It's divine, and thus it is in accordance with reality as God has made it.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:04.060]   And all throughout Scripture, we observe a consistent contrast between the truth and
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.060]   lies.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.220]   Ephesians 4, 9, 3, "Lies and not truth prevail in the land."
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.460]   Romans 1, 25, "They exchange the truth of God for a lie."
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:17.220]   Ephesians 4, 25, "Laying aside falsehood, speak truth to each one of you to his neighbor."
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.180]   1 John 1, 6, "If we say we have fellowship with him and yet we walk in the darkness,
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.620]   we lie and do not practice the truth."
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.740]   1 John 4, 6, "By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:36.500]   It's plain that the biblical authors presuppose the correspondence theory of truth.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:41.460]   So contrary to that young man's claim that anything can be true, even a lie, if enough
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:48.020]   people believe it, the Word of God declares emphatically, 1 John 2, 21, that no lie is
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.660]   of the truth.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.820]   Truth is not variable from person to person or from society to society because reality
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.620]   is not variable from person to person or society to society.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:07.940]   We all inhabit the same world under the same God who governs providence by the same inviolable
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.660]   laws of nature and logic.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.660]   If someone doesn't believe in the law of gravity and jumps from a five-story building, the
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.780]   effects of gravity will not be suspended because no gravity is his truth.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.780]   Gravity exists.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:28.580]   It is reality, no matter who believes it or not, and the truth is the same.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.380]   God is God and we are not.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:35.740]   His moral law is revealed in the Bible as the rule of our lives.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.680]   If we disobey, we are liable to His judgment.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.260]   The only way of escape is faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:47.340]   Someone may not believe those facts, but those facts are true, the truth is true, no matter
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.420]   who believes or disbelieves it.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.300]   What is truth?
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.500]   Truth is that which corresponds to reality.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:02.700]   And the culture is in chaos because it's rejected reality and exchanged it for subjectivist
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.500]   fantasy and self-determination.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.020]   They've rejected the truth, not only the truth of the gospel or the truth of the Bible or
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:17.300]   the truth of God's existence, they've rejected truth altogether.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:23.420]   And the fruit of that rebellious, failed worldview is the chaos we observe all around us, where
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:30.580]   people self-identify as cats, in which Supreme Court justices can't define what a woman is,
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.700]   and in which math professors say that insisting upon two plus two equals four, and this is
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:43.640]   a quote, reeks of white supremacist patriarchy.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.740]   Our culture has exchanged the truth of God for a lie, Romans 1:25.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:55.340]   God has given us over to the lust and impurity we see in Romans 1:24, to the homosexual perversion
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:03.540]   we see in Romans 1:26 and 27, to the depraved mind that embraces the absurd, Romans 1:28.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:09.600]   But as John MacArthur has said, if our society has come under the judgments of Romans 1,
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.800]   we must follow the prescription, the mandate, and the commission of Romans 1, and that is
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.160]   the proclamation of the truth of the gospel by which sinners can be saved from divine
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.160]   judgment.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.000]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.800]   It is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   the Greek.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.480]   For in it, the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith as it is written, 'The
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.960]   just shall live by faith.'
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.160]   Though the things of the spirit are foolishness to the natural man, 1 Corinthians 2, 14, though
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:52.560]   the natural man suppresses the truth in unrighteousness, nevertheless God still opens the blinded minds
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.020]   of the unbelieving and shines the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   of Christ.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.360]   And he does it by the proclamation of the very word of truth the unbeliever so hard-heartedly
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:10.740]   rejects until he doesn't, until the spirit of God blows over that heart and says, 'Mine,
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.760]   Christ will have, the lamb will have what he is worthy of.'
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.400]   Faith comes not by philosophical speculation, not by cantankerous bickering.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.600]   Faith comes by hearing the message concerning Christ.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:29.680]   And so my plea to you brothers, both for yourselves and for the people you serve, is do not retreat
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.160]   from this culture.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:40.240]   Touch right in to this culture, engage, have the difficult, annoying conversations, answer
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:46.000]   the hard questions, equip your people too with gentleness and reverence, give the Bible's
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.240]   answers to the lies of the age.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:56.440]   Friends, be salt and light, proclaim the truth, the truth of God, the truth of God's word,
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.120]   the truth of the gospel.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.360]   It's true.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.240]   We don't have a lasting city here.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:09.280]   And the truth seems to suffer under the assaults of the prince of the power of the air.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.640]   But the truth will triumph.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.880]   At the last, the truth incarnate will take his stand on the earth, and the earth will
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:23.620]   be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as waters cover the sea.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:29.680]   And amidst the joy and the triumph of that day, you will be glad that you stood firm
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.400]   and resisted in this evil day.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:37.440]   You may weep, you may lament now, while the rest of the world rejoices, but your sorrow
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.560]   will be turned into joy, because you will see him ruling the nations in righteousness
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.280]   and truth, then who shall fall on bended knee?
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.440]   All creatures of our God and king.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.960]   Lift the eye of faith, brothers, to behold him in that day of consummation, and trust
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:04.280]   him, and rest in him, and fight for him, and labor for him.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.320]   And if it comes, suffer for him.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.600]   Do all for the truth.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.160]   Let's pray.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.560]   Father, we can only rejoice in those realities because of the conquest of the truth incarnate.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:27.920]   Lord Jesus, we thank you for bearing the awful wrath in our place, for setting your face
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:34.280]   like flint to go to Jerusalem, for getting up from Gethsemane and going to the cross,
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:42.420]   and staying on the cross, and then rolling the stone away and coming out of the grave.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:49.040]   On that resurrection morning, truth triumphed once for all time.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:55.680]   And we walk in that triumph, not as consistently as we'd like, but we do.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.460]   We are free from the penalty and power of sin.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.880]   We have seen your grace at work in our hearts.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.720]   We have seen sinners saved and saints sanctified.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.480]   Would you refresh us with the reminders of those things, the tastes of fruit that we
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:21.000]   see in the ministry, even when it gets difficult and wearisome.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.560]   And Lord, we pray that you would just break the back of the lies of Satan in this world,
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:31.480]   in our culture, even especially in this city, which seems to be the hub of so much of it.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.680]   We pray that you would use the people of Grace Church, of the churches represented by the
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.480]   men in this room, to be faithful witnesses to the truth.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.400]   The truth needs to be testified to.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:50.320]   A faithful witness to Christ is desired each and every day in the workplace, in the neighborhood.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:58.720]   Oh, would you satisfy the hearts of your people to send them into that battle, ready to suffer,
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:05.640]   ready to die, ready to lay down their lives for the sake of proclaiming the truth.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.720]   What you could do for the faithful ministries of the men in this room, be zealous for the
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.840]   glory of your own name and accomplish it, not for our sake, but for the sake of Christ.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   We pray in his name.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   Amen.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.540]   Amen.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.040]   Amen.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
