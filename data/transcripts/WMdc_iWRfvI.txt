[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   A lot of things on my mind and my heart as we come to this conclusion.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.740]   The Lord always has a way of directing us so that He puts the pieces together, I think,
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:30.780]   in a sovereign, supernatural way. The message by Steve about the triumphant return of Christ
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:42.940]   with all of its violence and judgment, severity, followed by His kind invitation even to a
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:54.520]   group of pastors to be sure you're in Christ was so important, because we can be tempted
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.440]   in a lot of ways. And one of the ways that we can be tempted is to even doubt our own
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:15.360]   condition. We can be tempted to doubt that the Lord really has His hands on us permanently
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:27.120]   and forever. And if there is any doubt in your mind about your eternal destiny, or moments
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:37.440]   of doubt, or you wonder if something could change with God or with you that could obviate
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:47.560]   His promise, then you of all people would be the most terrified, because you know what
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:58.600]   the Scripture says is coming. And you know it's coming. The critics said in Peter's day,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.720]   "No, no, no. All things continue as they were since the beginning." And Peter said, "Did
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.760]   you forget the universal flood?" No, it's happened before, and there's evidence of it
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:19.400]   all over the earth. It's coming. So we, in order to enjoy the prospects and the promises
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.240]   of our eternal salvation, need to understand what Romans 8 provides for us, and that is
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:37.880]   the triumph of our Savior's love. The opening message was obedience, the triumph of the
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.360]   saints' love. The closing message is security, the triumph of the Savior's love.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:56.400]   And you can go back to Romans chapter 8. I was reading an article from some psychoanalysts
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.640]   who were trying to talk about what people want, and the article suggested that the first
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.400]   thing they want is food, and I get that; and the second is water; and the third is shelter;
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.920]   and the fourth is love. People need to be loved. Created in God's image, we were created
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.960]   for affection. We were created for love. They long for loving relationships. Hard to generate
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:36.000]   in this isolated culture where people spend all their time looking at media, and very
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   little time cultivating face-to-face relationships. People long for a loving relationship that
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:52.360]   lasts. They are crushed when love fails. Human beings long for a love that will never fail,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:03.840]   and not even wane, certainly not die and not disappoint. That love is really very rare
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:14.760]   in human society. But there is such a love that endures in its fullness and gives lasting
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:26.280]   satisfaction and lasting joy. And when I say lasting, I mean everlasting. To be loved by
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:35.860]   the God of the universe, to be loved with such a lavish love that what that love promises
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.740]   to us is even incomprehensible. We can't grasp the height and depth and length and
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:49.740]   breadth of it. It's an amazing love.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:58.880]   Before we go to Romans 8, turn back for a moment to the 13th chapter of John. Familiar
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   scene in the upper room. And Jesus is with His disciples, and there's a statement made
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.800]   in the first verse that has long penetrated my own heart. "Before the feast of the Passover,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.840]   Jesus, knowing that His hour had come, that He would depart out of this world to the Father,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:37.720]   having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end." This is the hardest
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:50.160]   night of His life. This is the eve of His crucifixion. This is the night of His betrayal.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.840]   And this is when His disciples had been unable even to watch for a few hours and uphold Him
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:11.360]   in prayer in the midst of His incomprehensible agony. They fell asleep, and they were seen
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.000]   in their weakness. When the Lord needed them to stand with Him in intercession, they were
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   useless. They were really at their ugliest. They had been squabbling about which of them
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.760]   would be the greatest in the kingdom. And in that moment when they were self-centered
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:45.120]   and indifferent to the reality that was told to them and was looming in a few hours, they
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   couldn't find it in their hearts to fix their attention on Him. It is in that moment that
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.440]   He loved them to the end.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:09.600]   Ice tell us to the max, to the end every way you can define the end. He loved them to the
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:22.720]   end without limits, completely, fully. To the extent of His capacity to love, God loved
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:31.680]   them. He couldn't love them more. He couldn't love them less. A love that surpassed all
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:41.880]   other loves could not be increased, could not be decreased, but a love reserved for
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:50.280]   His own. He loved His own who were in the world. He loved them even though in the world
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:58.640]   they were miserable failures. Peter was the most disappointing believer
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:08.120]   of the disciples. But in the hour of betrayal, in the hour of betrayal on the part of the
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.200]   disciples, even Peter, and the scattering of all the rest of them in fear in our Lord's
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:26.960]   most severe trial, He loved them to the end because that's the only way He can love
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:34.520]   His own to the max, to the full. And what do you mean to that? By that, the fullness
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:43.080]   of His capacity to love. However much love God can generate is exactly what He gives
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:55.200]   to His own. And Romans 5:8 says, "God demonstrated His love for His own, in that while we were
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:08.000]   yet sinners, Christ died for us." He loved His own when they were yet sinners. He loved
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.040]   them so much it would be impossible to love them more, because it would be impossible
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:28.880]   to do more than give His Son as a sacrifice. He loves His own with an everlasting, immeasurable
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.200]   love. This is the greatest gift a human being can be given. No matter how many other loves
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:44.000]   fail, this one never does. And it sounds too good, really. And some people who call themselves
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:54.360]   Christians think it is too good to assume that this love is that complete and permanent.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:01.560]   Can we be sure? Can we really be sure that we are loved like this all the way to the
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:10.320]   end, even in the ugliest moments of our lives? Well, the answer to that question is back
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:22.720]   in Romans 8, so let's go there. This, I think, is the most precious of all promises, that
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.640]   the Lord's love never fails, because if I wasn't sure of that, I couldn't enjoy any
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:41.040]   of the benefits. So go down to verse 31, "What then shall we say to these things?" What
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.920]   things are you talking about? Well, we're talking about everything from the beginning
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:52.520]   of the book of Romans, the gospel. "I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:59.000]   of God unto salvation to everyone who believes." And then Paul unfolds the bad news, and then
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.040]   the good news. And we see justification by faith in chapter 3. And then the glories of
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.440]   the gospel unfold from chapter 3, verse 20, all the way to chapter 8, verse 30. And in
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   verses 28 to 30, which we read earlier, you have a summation of the glories of our salvation.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.180]   It's a secure salvation, because verse 28 says, "We know that God causes all things
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.720]   to work together for good." If all things work together for good, then nothing can work
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:43.280]   together for bad. He causes all things to work together for good to those who love God,
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:53.360]   to those who are called according to His purpose. His purpose and His call determine that everything's
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:02.680]   going to work together for good. Then Paul looks at those wonderfully familiar terms
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.880]   in verse 29, "For those whom He foreknew, those whom He predetermined to set His love
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   upon, He predestined." Predestined to what? To become conformed to the image of His Son.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:29.080]   He predestined them to glorification, to conformity to Christ. This is His purpose, so that He,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:36.440]   Christ, would be the prototokos , the premier one among many brethren. And then Paul says
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   it another way, "These whom He predestined, He also called." And that is a life-giving,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:55.000]   regenerating, irresistible, divine call. "And those whom He called, He justified." No one
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.600]   is called and not justified. "And He also justified those who were called, so that they
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:16.640]   could be glorified." That's the purpose of God, to glorify those whom He called by conforming
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:28.080]   them to the image of His Son. So what should we say to this? This is breathtaking. Everything
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.240]   in our lives is working toward the purpose of God, which is our eternal glorification
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.000]   and conformity to Christlikeness. Everything. Nothing works against that. Everything works
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.280]   for that, because that is what God purposed. That is determined by His predetermination
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:14:00.220]   to love us, predestine us, justify us. It all brings us to eternal glory.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:09.560]   Can this be true? Can such grace be a reality? Going back to the first verse in chapter 8,
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:18.120]   "Is it really possible that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, that we
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:33.160]   will never be condemned?" Is this really true? It introduces two hypothetical questions.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   Number one, can God reject us? Can God become so weary of us that He changes His mind? Can
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.440]   God say, "I've had about all I can take out of you. You're such a disappointment. You
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:03.680]   fall short so often. You bring reproach on My name. You are an embarrassment. You're
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:12.080]   a problem to My church. You don't honor My Word as you should. You stumble and fall into
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:21.400]   the same sinful patterns that you were stumbling and falling into years ago. I'm worn out picking
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   you up and dusting you off. I'm weary of the mixed messages you send to the people who
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:37.880]   know you, because sometimes you act like a Christian and sometimes you don't." Could
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   God just say, "I really can't take it anymore. I'm canceling your eternal life"?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.560]   Or the second question would be this, the hypothetical possibility is that we reject
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:16:00.800]   God, that we say, "Look, I've been hanging in there as a Christian doing my part, and
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.640]   I don't really get the answers to my prayers that I would like. Does marriage have to be
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:17.660]   so difficult? Does my husband have to be such a jerk? Do I have to struggle at work? Do
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:24.680]   I have to fight the people close to me that should love me but make life difficult? And
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:35.920]   why all the illnesses and the diseases? And I've prayed for a long time, and I'm weary,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:46.280]   God, of Your failure to step in and make my life what I think it should be if You really
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.520]   loved me." So those are the two hypothetical possibilities that God gets tired of us and
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:17:00.760]   rejects us, or we get tired of Him and reject Him.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:09.160]   God rejecting us has a theological category, doesn't it? Those who deny the security and
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:17.680]   perseverance of the believer. And now there's a new theological category of people who reject
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:31.180]   God. It's called deconstruction, or exvangelicals, hashtag. Can either of these things happen?
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:41.660]   Can He stop loving us? Can we stop loving Him? Well, the answers are in this section
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.780]   starting in verse 31, and that's why the question is posed. What then shall we say to these
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:53.580]   things? How do we respond to the absolute character of salvation as summed up in verses
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:18:04.420]   28 to 30? How do we respond to that, that God had a purpose, and the purpose was to
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:11.580]   conform us to His Son in eternal glory, and He takes every step in the process to make
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:18.980]   sure that it comes to pass? What shall we say to these things?
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:33.140]   And 1 Paul poses the question, "Can God reject us?" Back to verse 31. It's assumed. If God
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:47.740]   is for us, who is against us? Can God find reason to take away our salvation? Well, certainly
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:59.600]   not based on verses 28 to 30, because whom He foreknew He predestines, He calls, He justifies,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:08.620]   and He glorifies. Look at that first part of the second half of verse 31, "God is for
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:17.740]   us." The assumption here is that God is for us. There are some people in some forms of
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:29.300]   evangelicalism who think God is against us. But listen to what Scripture says, Psalm 27,
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:39.220]   verse 1 to 3, "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:48.300]   the defense of my life; whom shall I dread? When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh,
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:54.660]   my adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell. Though a host encamp against me,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:03.420]   my heart will not fear; though war arise against me, in spite of this I shall be confident."
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:14.940]   Why? The Lord is my salvation. Listen to Psalm 46, "God is our refuge and strength, a very
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:22.500]   present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:29.340]   and though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam,
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:40.860]   though the mountains quake at its swelling pride." If everything starts to fall apart,
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:48.020]   God is going to be our refuge and our help. I love this in Psalm 46, 7, "The Lord of
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:56.900]   hosts is with us." Verse 11, "The Lord of hosts is with us."
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:04.500]   Psalm 56, 4, "In God whose word I praise, in God I have put my trust; I shall not be
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:15.060]   afraid what man can do to me." Or Psalm 56, 11, "In God I have put my trust, and I shall
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:23.420]   not be afraid what can man do to me." Or Psalm 84, 11 and 12, "For the Lord God is a sun and
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:29.580]   shield; the Lord gives grace and glory. No good thing does He withhold from those who
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:38.300]   walk uprightly, O Lord of hosts. How blessed is the man who trusts in You."
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:49.660]   Psalm 118, verse 6, "The Lord is for me." Isaiah 50, verses 7 to 9, "For the Lord God
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:57.060]   helps me; therefore, I'm not disgraced; therefore, I've set my face like flint. And I know that
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.700]   I'll not be ashamed; He who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:10.820]   stand up to each other. Who has a case against me? Let Him draw near to me. Behold, the Lord
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:21.580]   God helps me. Who is He who condemns me? The Lord is for us, all of this is saying."
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:27.540]   To the degree that Isaiah 54, 17 familiarly says, "No weapon that is formed against you
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:37.360]   will prosper." No weapon. "And every tongue that accuses you in judgment, you will condemn.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.100]   This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their vindication is from me, declares
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:51.680]   the Lord." In the wonderful language of John 10, verses 28 to 30, "I give eternal life
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.580]   to my sheep; they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.300]   who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:19.580]   Father's hand. I and the Father are one." Summed up, God is for us. He knows how weak
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:32.320]   we are. He knows how sinful we are. But He is for us. And Paul's about to prove that.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:42.120]   How do we know that? Look at verse 32. "He," meaning God, "who did not spare His own Son,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:50.880]   but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?"
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:01.520]   Amazing statement. The greatest proof of God's promise to keep us is what He sacrificed to
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:17.200]   give us. This is an argument from the greater to the lesser. His love is so strong that
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:24.440]   He gave His Son for us. Will He not do what is less than that to keep us? You can't do
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:34.040]   more than to give your Son to save us. We would assume You would do less than to keep
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:47.280]   us. He gave us the most, the best, and He has no capacity to hold back the least. That's
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:55.920]   why the Scripture says, "You're blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:04.480]   in Christ." He gave you Christ; that was the big sacrifice. The rest follows.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:13.680]   Back in the 5th chapter of Romans, just by way of reminder, wonderful familiar text,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:21.480]   Romans 5, 6, "For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:31.520]   We were helpless, we were ungodly. Verse 8 adds that we were sinners, Christ died for
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:41.480]   us. "If when we were helpless, and ungodly, and sinful, Christ died for us," then verse
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:49.000]   9, "much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be being saved from
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   the wrath of God through Him. For while we were enemies, we were reconciled. And if that
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:02.080]   is true, that God reconciled us to Himself through the death of His Son, much more, having
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:11.440]   been reconciled, we shall be being saved by His life." "Much more" in verse 9, "much more"
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.120]   in verse 10, "much more" in verse 15, "much more" in verse 17, "all the more" in verse
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:24.000]   20. And all of that language there is to say that if He gave you the greatest of all gifts,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:36.320]   He would follow that up with the lesser gifts.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:51.580]   This language draws me back to Genesis 22 where it talks about a sacrifice. Let me just
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:27:03.440]   draw you back for a minute. Genesis 22, a very familiar story. We don't need to go through
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:18.240]   the whole story. But verse 12, if I can get there. Abraham, Abraham, verse 11, ready to
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:26.960]   offer Isaac, took a knife to kill his son in verse 10. And in verse 12, "And the Lord
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.380]   says to him, 'Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him. For
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:42.240]   now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:49.520]   Me.'" In verses 15 and 16, "Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.140]   from heaven and said, 'By Myself I have sworn,' declares the Lord, 'because you have done
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:03.300]   this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son. Indeed, I will greatly bless
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:11.900]   you.'" The story of Jesus was different. Abraham
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:18.360]   had only one son, one that was a true child of the promise. In Him all the covenant promises
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.740]   would be fulfilled. In Him the nations would be blessed. Through Him salvation would come,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:28.060]   and the Messiah would come, and He was willing to offer Him in death. Isaac was spared by
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:38.420]   God by divine intervention; Jesus was not. So the picture is really contrast. The willingness
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:44.900]   of Abraham to offer up Isaac provides only a faint analogy of the Father's ultimate self-sacrifice
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:51.140]   in refusing to spare His Son. Abraham was willing, didn't have to do it. God was willing
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:29:02.940]   and did it. Would He have spared His Son if in the end
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:12.180]   He would accomplish nothing for those for whom it was said that He died? Would He have
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:18.460]   given His Son if He did not have the power to hold on to the ones for whom His Son died
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:29.380]   and whose sins His Son bared? Isaiah 53 10, "It pleased the Lord to bruise
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:39.020]   Him; He put Him to grief." So the first question is, would God become
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:51.900]   weary of us? Would He let go of us? Would He cancel our salvation? And Paul's answer
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:57.280]   from the greater to the lesser is, verse 32, "He gave His greatest gift; He will give
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:06.300]   the lesser gifts to sustain what the death of His Son purchased." He made Him to be
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:18.340]   sin for us. He put the curse on Him, Galatians 3. Delivered His Son to damnation and abandonment.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:25.500]   Who delivered Jesus to die? Not Judas for money, and not Pilate for fear, and not the
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:33.740]   Jews for envy, but the Father for love, the Father for love.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:39.460]   John Murray wrote, "It is only as the ordeal of Gethsemane and Calvary is viewed in the
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:46.180]   perspective of damnation vicariously born, damnation executed with the sanctions of unrelenting
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:52.540]   justice, and damnation endured when the hosts of darkness were released to wreak the utmost
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:58.860]   of their vengeance, that we shall be able to apprehend the wonder and taste the sweetness
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:10.220]   of love that passes knowledge, love eternally to be explored, but eternally inexhaustible."
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:18.820]   He put damnation on His Son to make us His own when we were ungodly sinners. And that's
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:28.420]   the point, isn't it? Verse 32, "Delivered Him for us all." Not just for our benefit,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:38.060]   but in our place. The us is the us of verse 31. Who is against us? The us of verse 31
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:48.180]   is the us of verse 29 and 30, "Those who were foreknown and predestined and justified and
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:55.060]   would be glorified." And that goes back to verse 28, "The us are those who have been
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:09.420]   called according to His purpose." So would God reject us? No. Paul says, "How, on the
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:17.380]   other hand, shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" That fits His eternal
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.980]   saving decree. The point is that if the Father didn't spare the Son, but gave Him up to the
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:32.380]   shame and horror of damnation and sin bearing on the cross to bring about an eternal goal,
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   that is the greatest sacrifice. Anything else that sustains us is a lesser act on His part.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:51.860]   To deny security is to misunderstand the work of God in His Son.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:33:03.980]   Well, if there's nothing we can do to cause God to reject us, can someone else come along,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:11.460]   let's say, and convince Him that we are an embarrassment, that His reputation would be
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:20.060]   protected if He didn't have to identify with us? If He just cut us off, we wouldn't bring
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:31.100]   a blight on His lovely name. Could someone come to God and say, "God, You're really,
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:47.660]   You're really giving up Your credibility by holding on to John MacArthur. He's an embarrassment.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:58.860]   You'd be better off to disconnect with him." Could somebody else come and do that?
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:08.380]   Turn to Isaiah 50, verse 7, "For the Lord God helps me; therefore, I'm not disgraced.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.820]   Therefore, I have set my face like flint, and I know that I will not be ashamed. He
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:19.380]   who vindicates me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up to each other. Who
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:26.820]   has a case against me? Let him draw near to me. Behold, the Lord God helps me."
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:35.660]   You want to make a case against me, you're going to have to get through Him. Who will
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:43.740]   bring a charge against God's elect? Well, who would want to do that? Satan in the case
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:50.900]   of Job; Satan in the case of Joshua, the high priest of Zechariah 3; Satan in Revelation
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:35:03.300]   12, 10, the accuser of the brethren who is before God. What does it say? "Night and day."
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:14.740]   Relentlessly indicting us, relentlessly bringing the case against us to God. Same kind of case
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:25.700]   he brought with regard to Job. Will God hear that charge? Can somebody successfully, verse
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:36.860]   33, bring a charge against God's elect? Answer, "God is the one who justifies." Literally,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:49.300]   "God the one justifying." No, He cannot condemn and justify at the same time. The case against
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:36:03.460]   believers and against their justification may be fought by Satan, but to no avail, because
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.260]   we are covered with the righteousness of Christ who bore our sin. That's why John Wesley
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:18.500]   wrote, "Bold shall I stand in that great day, for who ought to my charge shall lay fully
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:33.060]   through thee. Absolved I am from sin and fear, from guilt and shame." God's elect. Satan
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:40.100]   can bring all the accusations he wants. God will never condemn those whose condemnation
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:48.860]   was paid in full by His Son. Say, "Well, wait a minute. We haven't heard from the Son.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:57.220]   What's He got to say about this?" Verse 34, "Who is He who condemns? Christ Jesus? What
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:08.260]   if He says, 'I'm fed up. I'm embarrassed by these vacillating Christians who bear My
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:25.660]   name?'" Could our Lord Jesus turn against us? The answer comes, "Christ Jesus is He
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:40.380]   who died." Point one, He paid the full price for our sin. He died. He can't condemn us;
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:48.820]   He was condemned for us. He was delivered over to death on account of our transgressions
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:38:01.460]   back in chapter 4, verse 25. Not only that, who was raised, which means the Father was
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:09.880]   fully propitiated, fully satisfied that Christ paid the full and complete price for the sins
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:20.860]   of the elect, and raised Him from the dead for our justification, signifying that His
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:31.300]   death accomplished our eternal salvation. Would Christ turn on us? No, He died in our
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:38.220]   place. Would He turn on us? No, He was raised by the Father, validating the efficacy of
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:46.620]   His death. Thirdly, He is at the right hand of God. He is at the right hand of God. He's
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:53.900]   been exalted to heaven to the Father's right hand, as Psalm 110, verse 1 says, "The Lord
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:02.420]   said to My Lord, 'Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool.'" Christ
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:09.940]   died a substitutionary death that pleased God. God raised Him from the dead. God exalted
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:18.940]   Him to His right hand, which validates the efficacy of His work on the cross. That's
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:31.220]   not all. There's a fourth feature. He is now at the right hand of God interceding for us.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:39.860]   Christ won't turn against us. He intercedes for us as a merciful and faithful high priest.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:48.420]   In John 11:42 He said, "I know, Father, that You always hear Me." I can't resist reading
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:59.760]   a few verses out of John 17 that take us right into His intercession. Verse 13, John 17.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.620]   This is Christ's intercession. "Now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.900]   so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. I have given them Your Word."
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.820]   This is Christ in His intercessory work. "I've given them Your Word, and the world has hated
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.940]   them because they're not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not ask You
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:26.380]   to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. They're not of the
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:31.440]   world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; Your Word is truth. As
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:37.380]   You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. For their sakes I sanctify
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:44.960]   Myself that they themselves also may be sanctified. I do not ask on behalf of those alone, but
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.420]   for those also who believe in Me through their word, those who come in generations after
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:56.020]   the apostles, that they may all be one, even as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:02.780]   they also may be in Us, and the world may believe that You sent Me. The glory which
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:10.020]   You have given Me, I've given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one. I in
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.180]   them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:24.860]   You sent Me and loved them, even as You have loved Me. Father, love them the way You love
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.300]   Me. Christ isn't going to turn on us. He died
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:37.340]   in our place. He was raised by the Father for having accomplished our eternal redemption.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:46.980]   He was exalted to the right hand of God, triumphant in His death, and He now ever lives to intercede
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:42:01.860]   for us. God will not turn on us. Satan cannot affect a change in God's commitment. Christ
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:14.340]   would never, ever turn on us, because He accomplished everything to secure our everlasting salvation.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:26.940]   Okay, what about the other hypothetical? Could a believer reject God? Can you really deconstruct?
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:33.140]   Can you really say, "I'm done with Christianity? I'm worn out with it"? You hear this so often.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:40.780]   You know, I was raised in some kind of rigid Bible environment, and I didn't get my questions
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:47.420]   answered, and I don't like the direction that that life was taking me, and I don't want
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:54.780]   anything to do with that. I grew up maybe in a Christian family, at some point affirmed
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:03.020]   my faith in Christ, but I've changed my mind. So the question is, starting in verse 35,
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:11.940]   could a believer reject God? The question comes, "Who will separate us, or what will
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:18.900]   separate us from the love of Christ?" Now it's our turn. Would we walk away? Can life
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:26.980]   become so difficult, so disappointing, so tragic, so defective, so unfulfilling, so
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:39.180]   troublesome that we say, "Look, I've had enough"? Is that possible? Well, Paul says,
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:48.340]   "Let's check a few things." Could tribulation do that? That's the Greek word philipsis,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:57.140]   which basically means pressure, pressure, affliction, outward difficulty, accusation,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:11.340]   rejection, bodily harm. Philipsis, in Latin it's like flailing, like wood and leather
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:22.860]   whips, lashing, a very common word. It even appears in the agrarian environment when speaking
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:34.820]   about separating chaff from wheat, beating the grain. Can life just be so difficult that
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:47.540]   we reject Christ? Outward difficulty. Or maybe distress, second word, inward difficulty.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:45:00.460]   Sennachoria, it means narrow, narrow space, hemmed in, no way out. Can I become in my
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:08.420]   own mind so unfulfilled and so desperate that I don't see any way out, and I can't find
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:19.700]   fulfillment that I would turn away from Christ? Or maybe let's be more direct. Persecution,
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:30.740]   abuse. Literally the word means abuse, physical, mental abuse at the hands of Christ-haters.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:41.060]   Would that do it? Or famine, starving to death, perhaps because of that, persecution, deprivation,
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:49.300]   nakedness also associated with persecution. And then just a general word, peril, danger,
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:59.700]   being exposed to treachery, being in a culture where your life is threatened because of hostility.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:08.940]   Or even a sword, mecharia, meaning death. Could any of these things cause me to turn
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:17.340]   my back on my Savior? And, oh, by the way, that list of seven were very personal to Paul
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:36.620]   because they were all part of his biography. Paul had all of that in, honestly, mega doses.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:47.620]   He chronicles that, all his suffering, beaten with rods and whips and shipwrecked, and all
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:47:00.100]   the things he told the Corinthians. Was that enough to turn him against the Lord? It was
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:08.780]   to be expected. Quoting Psalm 44, 36, he adds, "Just as it is written, 'For your sake we
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.700]   are being put to death all day long. We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.'"
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:18.580]   Now that's where you see the personal touch. I lived through all this. This is not hypothetical.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:24.980]   This is my own experience, and I'm here to tell you I've been through it all. I've felt
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:34.420]   the powers of the pressure, and the distress, and the persecution, and the hunger, and the
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:42.540]   nakedness, and the cold, and the danger, and the sword which eventually flashed in the
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:54.580]   sun and severed his head from his body. And it's to be expected, and all of it, all of
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:48:07.740]   it, "For your sake," verse 36. So it's all happening to me because I'm connected to you.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:17.760]   This wouldn't be happening to me, Paul is saying, if I didn't represent you. I was willing
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:27.220]   to take up my cross and follow. I'm not sure I understood what it was going to mean.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:40.580]   This is a lot to bear. Could this do it? No. Verse 37, "But in all these things we overwhelmingly
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:52.480]   conquer, not in our own strength, but through Him who loved us." We are hupernickemen , super
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:49:04.780]   conquerors, winners of a sweeping victory, not just a bare escape. Love triumphs. But
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:12.540]   it's not so much our love as if it could triumph independently. It's His love that holds onto
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:21.780]   us. What does it mean to be a super conqueror? I think it means two things. You not only
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:30.380]   do not find yourself separated from Christ, but you find that, first of all, trials work
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:38.780]   to your greater good. Anytime you survive a trial and your faith is intact, that is
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:47.020]   a testimony to the validity of your true saving faith. But also, you find yourself strengthened.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:54.820]   The trials that you have have a strengthening work. They allow you to strengthen others,
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:04.300]   as our Lord told Peter. They increase your hatred of sin. They drive you to God. They
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:13.420]   help you recognize your weaknesses. That's why the Bible says trials perfect you. Trials
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:23.300]   work to your greater good, and secondly, they work to your greater glory. The benefits of
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.540]   those trials are going to show up in heaven.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:42.460]   Listen to 2 Corinthians. I know you know this; it's very familiar. "For momentary light affliction
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:49.940]   is producing for us an eternal weight of glory." So the weight of our glory is connected
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:57.400]   to the affliction here. Our momentary light affliction, relatively speaking, is producing
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:05.180]   for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison. So in what way are you a super
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:11.860]   conqueror? You not only conquer by sustained love to the Lord because He sustains His love
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:18.660]   for you, but the trial works to your greater good, which instead of weakening you, makes
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:30.120]   you stronger, and it increases your eternal glory.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:44.400]   Now the Corinthians weren't particular models of virtue or obedience. They had their issues,
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:52.960]   didn't they? But whatever victory they had over these kinds of assaults increased their
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:52:05.040]   strength and added to the eternal weight waiting for them in heaven.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:13.440]   Just an Old Testament passage comes to mind as we kind of wrap up, Isaiah 41. I have a
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:23.360]   lot more that I've been editing in my mind on the fly here tonight. But Isaiah 41.10,
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:34.640]   "Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.960]   strengthen you; surely I will help you. Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:47.560]   hand. Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored. Those who
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:54.800]   contend with you will be as nothing and will perish. You will seek those who quarrel with
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:01.560]   you, but will not find them; they'll disappear. Those who war with you will be as nothing
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:09.520]   and non-existent. For I am the Lord your God, who upholds your right hand, who says to you,
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:16.680]   'Do not fear; I will help you. Do not fear, you worm, Jacob, you men of Israel. I will
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   help you,' declares the Lord, 'and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.'" Back to Romans
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:36.240]   8. So there's no possibility that God is going to stop loving us, and there's no possibility
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:43.160]   that we're going to stop loving Him. As enduring as His love for us is, that's how enduring
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:48.760]   our love for Him is, because the love that we give to Him is that love which comes from
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:57.920]   Him shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. So the sum of it all. I'm convinced,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:10.640]   are you, that neither death, the greatest enemy, the gates of Hades, nor life - that
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:20.480]   covers it all with all its dangers and difficulties - nor angels, probably thinking of hypothetically
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:27.760]   good angels - no good angel can alter anyone's salvation or would want to do that - nor principalities,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:38.560]   perhaps He had in mind evil angels who would want to do that, but can't. And just in general,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.080]   neither life nor death, nor good angels, nor evil angels - and that takes care of the spiritual
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:55.860]   realm - nor things present here and now, nor things to come in the future. No dimension
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:05.000]   of time can ever sever us from Christ, nor powers - plural in the New Testament - refers
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:14.760]   to miracles, supernatural, mighty works. There is no supernatural act that can sever us from
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:25.520]   Christ, no mighty power. And stretching even further, nor height - that's an astrological
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:34.680]   term - hupsoma, it referred to a star at its zenith; or bathos, depth, when the star was
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:43.160]   at its lowest point, the height and depth of the universe. Nothing anyplace in life
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:54.960]   or death or the spiritual realm, or in time or the future, or in space from top to bottom,
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:05.280]   or any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.960]   is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:18.000]   George Matheson wrote back in 1882, when he went blind and he was engaged, and his fiancée
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.880]   finding out he was blind, decided to call off the marriage. That's when he wrote that
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:31.640]   wonderful song, "O Love That Will Not Let Me Go." And the sentiment behind that song
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   was Jeremiah 31:3, "I have loved you with an everlasting love." Is that good news?
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:54.120]   He will not let us go, and we will not let Him go. You say, "Whoa, wait a minute. I
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:02.460]   know a guy who believed and walked away." 1 John tells us, "They went out from us because
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:19.600]   they were not of us." Father, we are so undeserving of such a love,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:32.500]   so grateful for it. We should be literally in a spiritual euphoria every day of our lives
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:41.480]   to think that You love us like this. All the petty things of life should fade away compared
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:50.940]   to this eternal reality that You have for us, reserved for us in heaven, an eternal
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:58:02.240]   inheritance, undefiled, unchanging, unfading, reserved for us with our name on it. You have
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:15.640]   loved us to the max. Help us to love You, and show it in our obedience. In Christ's
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   name, amen.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   Amen.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   Amen.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   Amen.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   Amen.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   Amen.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   Amen.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.640]   Amen.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   Amen.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   Amen.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   Amen.
