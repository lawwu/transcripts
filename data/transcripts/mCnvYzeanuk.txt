[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Today I want to talk about faith, joy, and knowledge, and I want to put them
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.760]   together if possible. So Pastor John, as I'm sure you've heard, Augustine, of
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.680]   course, famously said, "Faith seeks understanding." And 700 years later,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.200]   Anselm said, "I believe in order that I might understand." That's profound. In a
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.420]   sense, faith is the doorway into more knowing. And then 800 years later, after
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.460]   that, Karl Barth came along and seems to push this one step further, essentially
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.380]   saying, "I believe in order to understand, and I seek to understand in order to
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.320]   rejoice." So for him, there's a progression, and joy is the possession of those with
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.780]   a knowledgeable substance to their faith. But I want to hear from you. How would
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.720]   you connect this train of belief, and reason, and affection? Well, I have to
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.500]   admit, Tony, that I have always been a little uncomfortable with the sentence, "I
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.000]   believe in order that I might understand." I admit that I have not read the
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   extended contexts in Anselm or Augustine to know precisely how they understood
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   those phrases, and I probably should keep my mouth shut in any critical
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.020]   sense of them. But the reason for my hesitation, just given the phrase itself,
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.640]   is that believing and knowing have so many different meanings and connotations,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.820]   even in the Bible. Sometimes believing is described as preceding knowing, and
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.280]   sometimes, in fact, more often, I think, knowing is described as preceding
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.240]   believing. A couple of examples. "Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.600]   believe in your commandments." So here, believing is the foundation of his
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.840]   prayer for knowledge. Or John 10:38, Jesus says, "If I do these works, even though you
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.560]   do not believe me, believe the works that you may know and understand that the
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.640]   Father is in me, and I'm in the Father." So Jesus says there's a kind of believing
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.120]   that can lead into a kind of knowing. So clearly those guys are onto something,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.840]   right? However, more often, I think, at least in my surveys, we read things like
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.000]   this from John 16:30, "Now we know that you know all things, Jesus. This is why we
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.880]   believe that you came from God." Or Psalm 9, verse 10, "Those who know your name put
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.760]   their trust in you." Or Proverbs 22, 19, "That your trust may be in the Lord, I
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   have made them known to you this day, namely the sayings of the wise." So
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.560]   knowing is a means to trusting, a means to believing. So we know from Scripture
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.040]   that it works both ways, depending on what you mean by believing and knowing.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.600]   Knowing is the foundation for believing, in some sense, and believing takes you
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   deeper into knowing, in some sense. If somebody were to ask me or say to me,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.360]   "Believe in order that you might know," I would probably respond by saying, "What
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.920]   truth do you want me to believe that I might know the truth?" So you can see the
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   problem immediately. It would be a very, I think, a very serious mistake to
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.240]   encourage people to believe in a Jesus they knew nothing about. Believing
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.760]   without content, without some knowing of information and truth, is empty mysticism.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.920]   And the biggest problem with this kind of mysticism is that an unknown Christ
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.680]   cannot be trusted and cannot be glorified. You can only glorify
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.040]   intentionally something you know to be glorious. This is why preaching the
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.240]   gospel precedes faith, and grasping it, knowing the meaning of what is preached,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   precedes faith. How are they to believe in whom they have never heard? So faith
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.640]   comes from hearing, and hearing through the Word of Christ. And I would add, and I
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.720]   think Paul assumes it, faith comes from hearing and understanding what you hear
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.480]   so that it's not gibberish. You know, it doesn't do any good to preach in Chinese,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   to an English speaker, about the gospel because he can't construe it. He can't
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:06.200]   know it in some sense. But it is also true that genuine faith opens the heart
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:15.560]   and mind to deeper and higher and wider knowing. True saving faith is humble and
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   teachable and in harmony with God and less vulnerable to Satan's deceptions.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.560]   And so for all those reasons, and probably more that Augustine and Enzel
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   saw that I don't, for all those reasons, faith is much more able to see things
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.380]   and know things about God than the proud, independent, deceived heart can know. So
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.000]   faith leads to understanding, and it wouldn't be wrong at all to say, "I have
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.480]   faith so that I may understand in that sense." However, now what you really were
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.360]   getting at was the joy piece. I haven't even touched it yet. When you stir joy into this
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.760]   mix, the Bible shows—it gets really complicated and yet glorious, I think—the
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.840]   Bible shows that joy is the outcome of both believing and knowing. Galatians 5:22,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   "Joy is the fruit of the Holy Spirit." We know that the Holy Spirit is given
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.080]   through faith. Galatians 3:5, "So joy is a fruit of faith as the Holy Spirit works
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.040]   through faith." And Romans 5:3, Paul says, "We rejoice in our sufferings knowing that
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   suffering produces endurance." You have to know something for this joy to kick in in
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.360]   the midst of suffering. And 1 Peter 1:6 says, "In this you rejoice, though now for
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.760]   a little while you endure various trials." And the "this" refers back to—I count
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.400]   about ten things in verses 3 through 5—of glorious things. We're born
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.960]   again, we have a living hope, Jesus is raised from the dead, we have an
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.400]   inheritance that's incorruptible, we're being kept by God. And he says, "In
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   this you rejoice," meaning you know this. I've just told you this, and you've read
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:18.120]   this, so now you know it and you trust in it and you rejoice in it. Now, Karl Barth
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.600]   is right, then, that we pursue knowing and we pursue believing, not as ends in
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.280]   themselves, but in order that we might go higher and deeper in our joy.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   Now, I would only add two things to that. This is why I said it may get a little
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:43.720]   complicated. One is that the reason God designed it that way is that God is not
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.960]   glorified when all that we know about him bores us. In other words, God does
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   not design the world just so that we might know things about him truly,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.080]   because if you know something truly and it bores you, God is not glorified in
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.720]   your knowing. And God didn't create the world to present himself as boring.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.440]   He created the world to present himself as glorious, and therefore we must move
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.040]   beyond knowing, believing, to joy. Otherwise, God doesn't look beautiful,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   doesn't look valuable. And the last thing I would say, and this is probably the
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.760]   most controversial, we might need a whole session on it, but I'll throw it out
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.960]   there because I don't think I can leave it unsaid since everything else seems to
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:41.880]   pass over it. Delight, satisfaction in the glory of God as revealed in Christ, the
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:49.360]   gospel, is not simply at the end of the process of knowing and believing. It's
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:57.760]   also at the beginning of it. I think treasuring Christ, that is, valuing him,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.720]   preferring him above all others, which includes delight in him, is an essential
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   ingredient in the very nature of saving faith at the front end of salvation. So,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.160]   in order even to make a start in the Christian life, God must open the eyes of
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.720]   the heart to see and know and believe that the glory of God in Christ is more
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:32.960]   precious and more sweet than anything. That's how we get started. We discover a
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.440]   treasure hidden in a field and sell everything to have it, which means in
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:45.120]   order to be saved, God awakens in us not only a knowing and not only a believing,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.840]   but also a valuing and a delighting in the glory of God. So, conclusion, last
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:59.080]   sentence, the new creation in Christ, you and me, the new creation in Christ is
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.760]   born, brought into being through the creation of joy and goes on for eternity
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.160]   from joy to joy. Yeah, there's a lot to chew on there, Pastor John. Thank you for
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.040]   looking at these historic theological formulas. If you have a formula of your
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.400]   own, a line from a creed or from a hymn, and you wonder what Pastor John thinks
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.480]   of it, send it to us. We'd love to hear from you on that topic. Send it to us
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   from our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. I'm your
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.280]   host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Wednesday.
