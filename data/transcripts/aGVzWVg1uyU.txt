[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Well, how is the gospel connected to God's absolute sovereignty?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.480]   Are they connected?
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.400]   They are connected, inseparably so.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.000]   And millions of people in the United States and around the globe over the past few decades
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.520]   have been waking up to this incredible connection.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.920]   As Pastor John explained in his 2019 Gospel Coalition National Conference message delivered
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.240]   just over a year ago, I wanted to revisit this message on Mark 8, verses 31 to 38.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.680]   Here's Pastor John in Indianapolis to explain.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.740]   Now something has been happening in the last 50 years that's amazing in the world in relation
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.480]   to this text.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   The Gospel Coalition, for example, has come into existence along with hundreds and hundreds.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   I first wrote thousands, but thought I'd stay with hundreds just because I could probably
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   find them.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.600]   I think it's probably thousands, but hundreds and hundreds of ministries, churches, schools,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.440]   mission agencies, publishing houses, websites, spiritual movements in dozens of countries
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:24.240]   around the world, millions of people have been waking up to the beautiful interweaving
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.440]   of the sovereignty of God with the gospel.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.760]   More and more people are coming to see and cherish that the ultimate control of God over
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.740]   all things is different than they thought it was.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.960]   Millions of people are discovering that the sovereignty of God is not peripheral, it's
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.040]   not troublesome, it's not academic for debate or argument.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:06.340]   It is a glorious divine reality and is the very stitching that holds the gospel together.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:17.200]   When Jesus says, verse 31, "The Son of Man must suffer, must be rejected, must be killed,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:27.680]   must rise because God has spoken, God performs His Word, God has planned this for an invincible
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   purpose."
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:39.840]   He is saying there is no gospel apart from the sovereignty of God, the all-controlling
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.400]   sovereignty of God.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   There isn't.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.920]   It doesn't exist.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.120]   Let's be more specific.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.920]   The sovereign control of God over the innocent suffering of Christ, the sovereign control
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   of God over the sinful rejection of Christ, the sovereign control of God over the wicked
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.440]   murder of the Son of Man.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.120]   Without those sovereign acts over that suffering, that rejection, that death, there would be
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.460]   no gospel.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.840]   It would be random.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.480]   Random death saves nobody.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Unplanned, unprophesied, unperformed, unpurposed suffering, rejection, murder saves nobody.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.720]   They save precisely to the degree that they are woven together by God.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.640]   It's His work for us and He sought to it at every level, in every minute detail that it
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.600]   would be successful.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.480]   No gospel without the sovereignty of God.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:11.240]   And I'm not saying that there are not people who make the effort to disconnect the all-controlling
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.480]   sovereignty of God from the innocent suffering, the sinful rejection, the wicked murder of
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240]   Jesus.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   There are millions of them, lay people, pastors, seminary teachers who make the effort to disconnect
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.320]   the all-controlling sovereignty of God from the gospel.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.480]   I'm not saying they don't exist.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:48.360]   I'm saying that in the last 50 years, millions of people around the world are seeing that
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   that effort is futile, unbiblical, undesirable.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   It is a rending of the precious fabric of the gospel because they see over and over
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:17.400]   again in Scripture, the sovereignty of God is the stitching that holds the gospel together.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.520]   They see a beautiful interweaving of the gospel of Christ with the sovereignty of God.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   They read Mark 8.31, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected and must
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.960]   be killed and must rise again."
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:47.640]   And without any long exegesis, without any long exegesis, millions are seeing it.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   But you see it.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:06:01.920]   Must suffer, must be rejected, must be murdered by lawless men.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.880]   And they find themselves worshiping, singing.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.080]   They say, "This was your son.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.840]   This was your son.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.680]   This was your plan.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.760]   This was your work.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.240]   This was your hand, innocent suffering, your hand, sinful rejection, your hand, wicked
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:38.960]   murder for me, for my forgiveness, for my everlasting happiness, the greatest gift at
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.080]   the greatest cost to the least deserving."
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:51.960]   And millions of people find themselves bowing down and saying, "I love you.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.280]   I love you."
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   That's what's happening.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.480]   You know, debates being won.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.840]   God is opening eyes to the stitching.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.480]   So the reality of the sovereignty of God has been sweetened in the minds of millions, sweetened.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.520]   It's a sweet thing.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.760]   As they come to see, it is the golden stitching that holds the fabric of the gospel together.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.040]   Amen.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.720]   You can listen to or watch this entire 2019 Gospel Coalition National Conference message

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.040]   the entire year.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.200]   So why do we celebrate Easter in the first place?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.240]   It's a great question that returns us to the very foundations and roots of our faith.
