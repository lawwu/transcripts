[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   We talked a lot about exercise to spend time on,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.160]   time you spend on work, thinking about time,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.440]   but I want to move to prana
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.680]   because it's not always about time.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   So maybe let's jump in here.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.880]   - So, I mean, you know, prana,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   the definition of prana is like this extraordinary energy.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.980]   This is like, almost think of like a tank of energy
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.160]   that all of us have,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.760]   but we don't always know how to access that.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.360]   And one of the reasons for that is because
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.680]   when we think about investing in a project
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.120]   or investing in an idea,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.860]   the thing that we are so conditioned to think about
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.200]   is like time, right?
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.980]   How much time am I going to give something?
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.320]   And ultimately, what tends to matter most
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.520]   when we look at sort of great projects that have come alive
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.240]   across all of these different industries
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.060]   wasn't really time, but it was heart.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.120]   How much heart did you really give that?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340]   That's why you see, you know,
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.960]   movies like "The Clockwork Orange"
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.360]   that were like written in a few days, right?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.800]   "The Great Gatsby," all these great works,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160]   they were written in a fraction of the amount of time
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.960]   that you might think because all of a sudden
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.080]   there was this creative burst of inspiration
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.240]   and they were to sit down
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.400]   and just like really, really bang it out.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.680]   And that's just kind of proof
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400]   that like what we're really trying to optimize here for
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.080]   is heart and not time, right?
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.780]   And so it's much better to be fully,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.280]   like full hearted with your dharma
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.040]   than it is to be fully scheduled.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.000]   And, you know, the example that like is very similar,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.280]   I know like you've had like people talk about meditation
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.260]   on this show.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.200]   You know, I went and spent time at like, you know,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.880]   a monastery and what I was kind of surprised by,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.080]   I guess, you know, I'm surprised now to have been surprised,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.720]   but at the time, like I kind of expected
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.360]   that these monks were like sitting around
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.480]   and meditating all day.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.120]   And the truth is they weren't, right?
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.420]   They were meditating for three or four hours a day,
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.720]   but the rest of that time was spent like working the land,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.460]   doing all the stuff that they needed to do,
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.040]   doing the duties that they needed
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.720]   in order to make the place actually function, right?
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   But their life was dedicated to meditation.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.800]   And the point being that just because you're dedicating
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.100]   your life to something, just 'cause you care about it,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.840]   doesn't necessarily mean you're spending every waking hour
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.920]   doing that thing.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.720]   What is more important is that you're finding ways
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.920]   to really bring your best prana,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.840]   your best energy and your best heart to those moments.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.200]   So, you know, for me, like, you know,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.140]   writing for a half hour every morning is way, way better
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.100]   and produces much stronger long-term results
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.180]   than if I was actually spending two hours
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.700]   in the afternoon writing.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.380]   It's just literally the degradation of my brain.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.020]   And it's the degradation of my creative horsepower.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.400]   I mean, I can sit down and I can write,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.140]   but it's not gonna end up being any of the pearls
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.700]   that ultimately make it into the book.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.500]   Like 99% of what I write ends up in a trash bin, right?
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.200]   And so what I'm looking for is like these little pearls
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.000]   in this, you know, in this piles of horse shit
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.960]   that I write each day.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.660]   And it turns out that like the little pearls
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.320]   are much more likely to appear
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   in that half hour morning session
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680]   than a two hour writing block in the afternoon, right?
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.800]   I know that about myself.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.480]   And so for me, my dharma is to write and to tell stories,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.240]   but it's not like I spend all day, every day,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   like doing that.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   I mean, I've got kids, I've got other work
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.820]   that pays the bills.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.280]   You know, there's a lot of other things going on,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.720]   but I have to make sure to have this commitment.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   The second thing about that then is like,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.980]   how do we then like condition ourselves
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.400]   so that we have the right energy at the right moment, right?
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   And for me, this was sort of a big breakthrough,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   which is that like, I've always sort of looked at rest
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.000]   and recovery as something that you did in long periods,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.840]   right?
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.380]   So I would take myself to a breaking point.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.400]   I would take myself to the red.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.880]   And then I would say, I need a vacation, right?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.500]   And my wife and I, we would plan this.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.440]   We'd be like, hey, like, we have this one week vacation
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   scheduled.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I would literally look at three months
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.080]   between now and then, and I'd kill myself, right?
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.040]   But the problem with that is I would literally
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.320]   return back from vacation with less gas in the tank
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   than before that three month period even started, right?
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.200]   And the science kind of bears this out.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.640]   I mean, most people actually return from vacation
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   and say they're more stressed one week after they return
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.600]   than one week before they left, right?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.840]   Point being, like, vacations are like wonderful,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.200]   can be a wonderful thing.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.080]   They're great for reconnecting with family,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.600]   and seeing new places, and spending time with friends.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.080]   But they're actually not as effective an instrument
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.360]   for dealing with burnout than we may assume.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.480]   What tends to work much, much better
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.840]   is when you can actually have frequent focused recoveries
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.520]   throughout the day, every single day.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.200]   In fact, like, average high performers,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.840]   whether it be in business, or be in music, or be in sports,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.080]   they're taking somewhere around eight breaks
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.040]   every single day, right?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.680]   About one an hour throughout a work day, which, like, I
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   know sounds extraordinary.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   But when I started to put this into practice,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   I used what I call the 55-5 model, which
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.560]   is like for every 55 minutes of work,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.960]   I'm taking five minutes of focused recovery, right?
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   And that five minutes can be doing anything,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   like literally anything.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   It can be sipping out a cup of coffee, it can be doing pushups,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.960]   it can be taking a walk to the mailbox and back,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.620]   like, doing whatever it is you're doing,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.000]   but you're not multitasking it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.340]   You don't have your phone with you when you're doing it,
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.040]   and you're, like, getting some quasi-rest
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.320]   and quasi sort of work done at the same time.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.800]   Those five minutes are deliberately non-productive.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   You're focused on rest.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   And people have a very hard time with this.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.960]   I know I did.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.240]   And the reason for that is because what
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.640]   we feel like we're doing--
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   again, we're in a time-based model--
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   is that we're shrinking the amount of time,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.520]   productive time, we have in our day, right?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   We already feel squeezed as is.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.880]   If you're shrinking five minutes from every hour
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.320]   and you're working, let's say, nine hours a day,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.640]   you're shrinking your schedule by 45 minutes,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.180]   which is significant, right?
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.000]   We could use that 45 minutes.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.720]   But if you give this a shot, what I can almost promise you,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.440]   based on experience from myself and from watching others
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.720]   put this into practice, is that five minutes
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.440]   is going to make the other 55 minutes far more productive,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.360]   far more effective, far more imaginative.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.080]   You're going to be far more collaborative.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   Like, all the things that we associate with success,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.920]   you will have more of that in the next 55 minutes
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.480]   than you did if you were just waiting to the end of the day
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.640]   to finally unload and burn yourself out.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.760]   Because it's just clearly not working.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.600]   As I read this and as you talk about it,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.520]   I think about how Google has this speedy meetings feature,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.360]   where you can say, set these meetings to 25 minutes for--
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.600]   like, a 30-minute meeting is now by default 25,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.240]   and an hour meeting is by default 50.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.240]   But it takes the ability to turn the meeting off at 50,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.960]   because so often, it's like, oh, I
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.480]   know no one on this call scheduled the next 10 minutes,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.580]   so we could just run over.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.280]   And then I was thinking about, I remember
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.520]   when I had a Zoom account that was free.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.120]   And it's like, oh, there's that timer.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.920]   And it's like, this meeting is going to run out,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.360]   and we are going to turn it off.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.080]   And I've been in meetings like that.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.720]   So if anyone out there knows of a way
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.520]   that I could hack Google Calendar and Google Meet
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.540]   to just actually shut the meeting down at 50 minutes
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.520]   to force everyone to end, I would
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.280]   love to see that feature in action, because I find it hard--
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   I can schedule the 5- or 10-minute break,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.120]   but it's really hard to actually take it.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.280]   Yeah, it's funny, because I'm on all these different platforms
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.000]   now for virtual stuff, and you are too.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.640]   And I notice on Microsoft Teams, when
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.480]   they set the meeting for a certain length,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.880]   they will actually say, five minutes left in the meeting.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.180]   And then they'll have a countdown timer.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.840]   Now, I don't think it actually shuts off at that time.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.080]   But the fact that there is actually
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.740]   a bit of a countdown timer, I do find to be somewhat helpful.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.100]   It's like, hey, this is the meeting you called.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.000]   These are the people whose schedule you're dealing with.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.900]   Everybody is assuming this one thing.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.440]   Let's put a little bit of a countdown
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.940]   timer in the last five minutes.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.900]   I find that to be somewhat helpful.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.940]   But I agree with you, man.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.540]   I was the kind of guy who, if I had two extra minutes
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.900]   in between meetings, I would go to my to-do list,
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.620]   and I would grab, oh, what can I knock out?
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.380]   What can I knock out quickly?
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.740]   And there'd be a little bit of an energetic hit
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.940]   that I would get from that.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.380]   But the problem was that throughout the day,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.300]   like clockwork, I would end up slumping.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.060]   At the end of the day, I was far less energized
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.420]   than I was at the beginning of the day.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.980]   And that hurt because there were some times
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.380]   where there was key meetings, key moments that
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.660]   were in the afternoons.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.660]   I remember when I was raising money, even,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   and I was out there pitching investors.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.500]   Yeah, some meetings were in the morning when I was fresh.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.000]   But there were a lot of meetings that were in the afternoon.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.300]   So I know that, looking back, I would perform with far less
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.820]   quality.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.220]   I would be far less compelling in those afternoon meetings
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.380]   than I was in the morning.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.660]   And part of the reason for that is because that morning,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.020]   I was spent grinding.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.060]   And then I would walk straight into that meeting,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.100]   and I would take all the baggage from that grind.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.340]   I would take no time to reset myself.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.820]   Maybe if you look at people who I think are--
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.060]   if you strap for time, who do this very well,
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.900]   and they don't have five minutes,
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.980]   I think one of the most important things you can do
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.860]   is to provide some type of transition for yourself
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.380]   in between two big moments.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.300]   And again, if you only have 30 seconds,
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.700]   even if you have 10 seconds, it is deliberately
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.300]   saying I'm going to be non-productive for a period
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.900]   of time.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.340]   And the difference between 0 and 10 seconds,
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.620]   whether it's closing your eyes and taking a breath
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.740]   or literally getting up and stretching, doing something,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.820]   will be game-changing if you're having
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.700]   these transitions throughout.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.040]   And it's different for everyone.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.700]   For me, the afternoon meetings and the afternoon pitches
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.980]   were actually really great because I didn't have anything
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.700]   to worry about.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.820]   If I go into a meeting at 8, I'm all these things.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.060]   What came in overnight?
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.980]   What emails do I have to respond to?
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.040]   But by the afternoon, I've been able to catch up
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   on all the other stuff.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.300]   So I think it really depends on a per-person basis.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.860]   Sometimes my wife asks, why were you up till 2 in the morning
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.460]   last night?
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.540]   And because we both have to get up-- we have kids.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.100]   We got to get up at 6 to 7.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.740]   The kids are up.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.500]   We're up.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.260]   And I was like, well, I just had this bout of energy.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.220]   And I felt like I could get done in two hours what I would
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.380]   normally take 10 hours to do.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.460]   And so I can--
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.500]   now, the hard part is forcing yourself
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.980]   to use that time you've saved to actually recover.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.180]   But sometimes when I find this prana, I'm just--
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.940]   I'm like, let's capture it when it's there.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.140]   And sometimes it surprises me.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.500]   That's a really good point, man.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.940]   We can't always count on prana.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.580]   It's tough to predict when your prana is
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.540]   going to be really high.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.420]   There are patterns, for sure.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.580]   For me, I remember when I was at the office day in and day out,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.220]   I would try to work out in the middle of the day.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.820]   We had a newborn at home.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   The mornings were very tough.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.560]   And when I went home, I wanted to spend time with the family.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.380]   So I'd try to work out at around 12 o'clock.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.260]   And then I would end up scheduling meetings
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.180]   at 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.020]   But what I found is that after I finished working out,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.540]   I felt really good.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.580]   I felt really creative and awesome.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.260]   And I was like, all right, well, why
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.460]   am I scheduling a mundane meeting at 1 o'clock,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.420]   in that case?
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.180]   I should be scheduling a block of time,
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.980]   like at least a half hour, where I can get back from the gym,
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.580]   and I can go to my desk, and I actually
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.140]   can write down a few things that are really important.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.300]   I can spend some time doing some deep work.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.060]   And when I did that, that changed things as well.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.460]   And it's a great point.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.540]   Figure out where the pockets of your day
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.900]   are, where you tend to have your highest prana.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.020]   But then also, sometimes it'll just happen spontaneously.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.580]   And when it does, try to give yourself enough flex
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.940]   where you can capture it.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.060]   Yep, I definitely do that a lot.
