[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Randy Alcorn joins us one final time this week
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.600]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.160]   and Pastor John will be back with us on Monday.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.040]   Randy, of course, is the author of the new book, Happiness,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.280]   a really excellent book,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.160]   and Randy, you wrote the best-selling book, Heaven,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.040]   and now you've written the book, Happiness.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   So how will joy in eternity be similar or be different
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.920]   from the joy that we can experience right now?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.440]   - Well, I think joy in eternity will be
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   the same sort of thing we know as joy
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.920]   and happiness and delight right now,
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.920]   but it will be purified and absolute in the sense that,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.640]   as Paul says, we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200]   We live in a world under the curse,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200]   and so there's always, even as we rejoice,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.680]   even as we rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.280]   we weep with those who weep, and that's right,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   and it should be.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.760]   We don't just paste on a smiley face
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   as we look at a world of tremendous need,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.640]   of children suffering, and you've got sex trafficking,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.200]   you've got all of these different things.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   So right now, our happiness in Christ
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.680]   is something that can and should be very real,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.620]   but at the same time, we recognize
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.640]   that I can't be absolutely happy all the time.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.040]   In fact, it would be inappropriate
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.520]   if I was given the condition of the world.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.880]   So what will happen in eternity
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   is we enter into our master's happiness.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   I just love that it doesn't, you know,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.680]   that the master doesn't say to his servant,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.160]   muster up your own happiness and bring it here,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.540]   and it's your duty to make yourself happy all the time.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.180]   It's that he says, enter into my happiness,
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260]   and the very place of heaven,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.640]   which is what makes heaven such a desirable
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.780]   and wonderful place, is that it is permeated
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.460]   by the person of God.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.140]   It's where God is.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.100]   You know, we shouldn't want to be in a heaven without God.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.540]   First of all, it wouldn't be heaven truly,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.180]   but God is the one who brings his nature to it.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.600]   All of his attributes, including his happiness.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.280]   So I think what happens is in this life, here and now,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   we do get foretaste of the complete and total bliss,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.480]   the utter happiness of heaven.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   And we can, even in the midst of great difficulty,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   do what "Valley of Vision," the book of Puritan prayers,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   is full of words, the word happiness and its synonyms,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   and yet it's just so deep with the burdens and realities
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.420]   of a sin-defiled world, but always with the sense of hope,
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.800]   a blood-bought hope, a hope with substance and expectation
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.600]   that one day God is gonna wipe away the tears from every eye
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.280]   as Revelation 21, four says.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.180]   There will be no more suffering, no more pain.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.120]   There will be no more separation.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   We will experience all of the realities of who God is
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.680]   and every day will be better than the one before.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.520]   The old fairy tale ending, happy ever after,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.840]   that's not a fairy tale.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560]   That's God's unfolding drama of redemption,
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.080]   the greatest story ever told,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.440]   the ultimate redemptive story,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   and he promises us we'll never pass our peaks
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   and we will live happily ever after in his presence,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   to his glory and for our good.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.860]   And that magnificence should permeate our lives
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.600]   and our thinking today.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   We should not wait until we die
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160]   to discover a taste of all that.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   We should be experiencing it daily, even now.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.320]   - Amen, yes, Randy Alcorn,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.500]   thank you for joining us this week

[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   from a listener who is a seeker who asks,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.680]   when do I know when it's time to believe in Christ?
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280]   No matter where you're at spiritually,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.840]   you won't wanna miss this episode.
