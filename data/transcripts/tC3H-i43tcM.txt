[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Well, does the law empower our sin nature?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.920]   Are we more sinful after the law arrives?
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280]   It seems like that's the case from what we read in the New Testament.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.440]   The question is from a listener named Sam to Pastor John, who joins us over Skype today.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.560]   Pastor John, the more I read Paul, the more I think I see that the arrival of the Mosaic
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.280]   law did not weaken sin, but actually empowered and inflamed sin within us.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.480]   Is that right?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   Can you explain this?
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   How does the law make sin more alive and potent inside of us?
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.840]   I'm thinking of when Paul talks about how our sinful passions are aroused by the law,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.480]   Romans 7, 5.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.760]   He says the law came to increase sinning in Romans 5, 20.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   Of course, the number of our sins increases as sins are named.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.600]   But Paul seems to be talking about a new influence when he writes, "The power of sin is the
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   law."
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.480]   That's 1 Corinthians 15, 56.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   Then he says, "Apart from the law, sin lies dead."
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.240]   That's Romans 7, 8.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.520]   Or where there is no law, there is no transgression.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.000]   Romans 4, 15.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   Maybe most provocatively of all, Paul speaks autobiographically in Romans 7, 9 when he
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.920]   makes this claim, "I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.400]   sin came alive and I died."
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.600]   If this is true, it's an incredible argument against legalism and any law-centered attempts
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.480]   to defeat the sin within us.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720]   We'd need a far greater power.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.840]   How do you explain Paul's understanding of law and its empowerment of our sin?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   Wow.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   That's huge.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   Yeah, it is.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   That's huge.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   Good.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.920]   I was so many parts.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:00.880]   The issue of the role of the Mosaic law in Paul is big and it is complex.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.880]   So let me begin with a book recommendation because I can barely begin to dig into all
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.200]   those pieces that he just strung together.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480]   Thomas Schreiner, good friend, teaches at Southern Seminary.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920]   His book, Forty Questions About Christians and Biblical Law.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.040]   So go get that book and then my little attempt here can be just a taste of what feast you're
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.480]   going to find in that book.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.920]   So what I think will be helpful for me to do here in this limited scope where people
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.640]   write volume after volume of books on this issue is to make seven kind of summary statements
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.280]   about the Mosaic law with a couple or maybe one or two supporting Bible verses so people
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.840]   can actually hear where I'm getting the statements.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.880]   And then I'll try to end by showing practically how this makes a difference.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.840]   And now keep in mind that when I say Mosaic law, law of Moses, I don't mean the whole
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.520]   Old Testament and I don't even mean the whole five books of Moses, the Pentateuch it's called,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   the five books.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.240]   The law has a distinct role to play within the Pentateuch.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.160]   This is important to see.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.280]   It's not synonymous with the first five books of the Bible.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:47.760]   Paul saw justification by faith being taught in Genesis 15 and he points out that 430 years
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.240]   later the law came in, Galatians 3.17.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.360]   In both of these realities, justification by faith and the Mosaic law, they're both
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.040]   in the Pentateuch.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:10.000]   So the Old Testament has its own way, the Pentateuch has its own way of teaching justification
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.400]   by faith apart from works of the Mosaic law.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.600]   So don't equate law, as I'm about to talk about it, with the Old Testament.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.200]   And don't equate law, as I'm about to talk about it, with the Pentateuch.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.320]   I'm talking about the Mosaic stipulations, especially in the book of Exodus, that come
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.160]   in 430 years after the covenant made with Abraham with its distinct purpose to play
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   in the redemptive history.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.640]   So here are my seven statements.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:50.120]   Number one, through the law comes the knowledge of sin, not the deliverance from sin.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.240]   Romans 3.20, for by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight since
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.720]   through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.280]   Or Romans 7.7, if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.800]   Statement number two, the law, therefore, secures and increases the accountability of
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   all the world.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.560]   Romans 3.19.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.240]   Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law so that
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.880]   every mouth may be stopped, every mouth may be stopped, not just Jewish mouths, and the
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   whole world made accountable to God.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   Statement number three, without the law, sin lies, quote, dead.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.480]   That is, unrecognized and unstirred by the aggravations of commandments.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   Romans 7.9, apart from the law, sin lies dead.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.800]   I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive, stirred
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.680]   up by those commandments, and I died.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:21.800]   Statement number four, the law turns sin as a power into sin as a transgression, actual
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.040]   breaking of a specific commandment.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:33.200]   Romans 4.15, the law brings wrath, but where there is no law, there's no transgression.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.880]   Or Romans 5.20.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.320]   Now the law came in to increase the trespass.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.360]   So the specific commandments of the law turn sin into commandment breaking.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.560]   Number five, the law doesn't just turn sin into trespasses of specific commandments,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:01.240]   it actually aggravates sin itself and makes it more active.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.960]   See that in the rest of Romans 5.20.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.480]   Now sin came in to increase the trespass.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.120]   That's the part we had just seen in statement number four.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.720]   And then it adds, but where sin increased, not just where transgressions increased, but
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.760]   where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   So the effect of the law is not just to turn the power of sin into specific law breaking,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.960]   but actually aggravates sin into greater virulence.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:41.400]   Number six, so we see that sin is a power, a kind of slave master or ruler that turns
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   commandments into aggravated incitements to transgress.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   Chapter seven, verse eight of Romans, sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.480]   produced in me all kinds of covetousness.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.880]   It's a kind of slave master that takes a hold, reaches out and grabs a commandment instead
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.920]   of humbly submissively obeying it.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.800]   Sin uses that very commandment to multiply sinning.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.040]   And then finally statement number seven, the law pointed toward Christ.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:31.360]   But until Christ came, it functioned mainly to show the hopelessness of salvation by law.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.880]   So the law functioned, you could say it negatively, as a prison, or you could say it positively
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.240]   as a guardian.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.440]   Paul uses both in Galatians, until Christ came.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.560]   Here's the key text, Galatians 3.23.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:54.960]   Now before faith came, that is before faith in Christ preached in the gospel came, we
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:03.160]   were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.640]   And then he says it a little differently.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.120]   So then the law was our guardian until Christ came in order that we might be justified by
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.880]   faith.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:23.360]   Now I think that to benefit from these statements, we need to get at the essence of what sin
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   is.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   We've been using, I've been saying that word over and over again, but I haven't ever defined
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   it.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   What are we talking about?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   What is this awful power that takes this beautiful thing called holy, good, just law, as Paul
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.680]   says, and makes it and prostitutes it and turns it to such evil uses.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's clear from these statements that sin is the underlying force that takes something
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.900]   essentially holy and just and good, namely the law, and makes it an instrument of evil.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.080]   So we really won't make much progress, it seems to me, in holiness or freedom or right
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:13.160]   use of the law if we don't get at what sin is and how it works.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.440]   And I think the best place to get at what sin really is, at its essence and power, is
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.280]   first Romans 3.23 and then Romans 1.23.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.760]   Romans 3.23 is real familiar.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.000]   It says, "All have sinned and fall short."
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.080]   And that literally means, "Eustereo," the Greek word means "lack."
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.880]   They lack the glory of God.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.800]   Sinning is, whatever it is, it involves a lacking of the glory of God.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.360]   Now what does that mean?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.640]   And I think Romans 1.23 gets at the essence of what it means.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:58.880]   Describing all of humanity, Paul says, "They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   images."
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.760]   Now that, I think, is what Paul means when he says, "We've all sinned, and the essence
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.640]   of it, the heart of it, is we lack the glory of God."
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.440]   That is, we've traded it away.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.600]   We've looked at it.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.640]   We've despised it.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.760]   We've demeaned it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.040]   We've preferred other things to it.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.640]   We've taken the infinite value and beauty and greatness of the glory of God, and we've
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.280]   said, "I prefer cars," or, "I prefer food," or, "I prefer family," or, "I prefer fame,"
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.560]   or, "I prefer sex," or, "I prefer alcohol," or, "I prefer just a good name in the community,"
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   whatever.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.480]   We've just put the glory of God aside.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   It's not our primary pleasure.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.040]   It's not our treasure, and we have thus despised, blackballed, committed treason against the
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.440]   glory of God.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   So I define the essence of sin—it's the heart of every human being born into this
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:07.840]   world—as the powerful condition of the human heart which prefers other things over God,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:15.880]   prefers anything, any other things, over the value and beauty and greatness, the glory
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880]   of God.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:26.000]   And that preference for other things, especially our own exaltation and our own authority,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.960]   is the power that takes hold of the commandment, say, the commandment not to covet.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.700]   And I think there's a good reason why Paul chose that commandment to illustrate the point.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:43.560]   It takes hold of the commandment not to covet and necessarily produces all kinds of covetousness
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:52.340]   through that very commandment, because the command not to covet is the very command not
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:59.660]   to desire anything in a way that shows we are not satisfied in the supreme value and
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.940]   beauty of God.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:13.500]   So the law itself can be an aroma that stinks and kills, and it can be an aroma that is
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.720]   sweet and precious.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.540]   The psalmists in their best moments said, "I love your law.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.900]   It's a delight to me."
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:29.860]   The difference is whether we have trusted Christ, turned to Christ, who's called the
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:37.660]   goal of the law in Romans 10, 4, and have received forgiveness for our sins, have been
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:46.900]   born again, so that now we don't use the law in our sin, preferring other things to God.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.700]   We don't use the law as a way of exalting ourselves through moral performance in the
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.980]   hope that we might get ourselves right with God by our own bootstraps and thus present
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.660]   ourselves in some acceptable way that preserves our own ego and our own self-exaltation.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.060]   No, no, no.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:15.240]   In Christ, we are already, through the blood of Christ, already right with God.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.420]   Our old, proud, arrogant, self-sufficient selves are crucified.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.380]   We no longer exchange the glory of God for the glory of self-exaltation.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:37.540]   Instead, now, we treasure the glory of God, and his law then becomes a pleasing reflection
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.460]   of his character and his will, which we delight in.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:49.060]   And maybe the way to draw it all to a close would be to use Romans 7, 6.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:59.340]   Now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive so that we serve
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:07.180]   in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the written code.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.620]   Man, what a precious little survey of the law.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.040]   We put you to work with this one.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.140]   And thanks for listening, and thank you for supporting DesiringGod.org and this podcast,
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   Pastor John.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.580]   Even with all the disruptions in this crazy year, ministry has been full throttle for
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.580]   us in 2020.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.260]   In fact, it feels like the Lord has given us even more work to do this year in addressing
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.420]   the pandemic, particularly with the international launch of Pastor John's new book, Coronavirus
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   in Christ.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.860]   We're investing tens of thousands of dollars to get that timely book translated and distributed
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.700]   around the world, working to make it free of charge, available in 29 different languages,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.060]   and possibly even more as time goes on.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.340]   And all of this at a time when so many organizations are forced to cut staff and slash budgets.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.740]   Instead, we are actually spending more money than ever to freely give away the best news
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.740]   in the world.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   And all of our ministry—the website, the books from Pastor John, and of course, this
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.860]   podcast—all of it is possible because God continues to raise up generous ministry partners
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.260]   around us, people who regularly pray for us and who donate to support all of our work.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.760]   If that's you, thank you for your partnership.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.220]   We can't do it without you.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.260]   And if this is not you, maybe you've been a listener to the podcast or a reader of the
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.180]   website for a long time or downloaded free books by Pastor John or watched our YouTube
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.180]   videos.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.840]   Maybe you've been blessed by all the content that our partners have made free of charge
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.700]   to you in the past.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.140]   And now maybe you want to become someone who will now make those resources available to
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.620]   a new generation who will experience all of Pastor John and Desiring God's content free
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.660]   of charge.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.140]   If that's you, now is a great time to join us as our fiscal year ends in June and our
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.620]   new fiscal year begins in July, and we dream about all the new resources we want to make
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.540]   in the year ahead and new audiences we want to reach as well.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.300]   Join us today by going online to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.500]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.660]   Thank you for supporting us.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.820]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.820]   Bye.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:04.820]   Bye.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   Bye.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   Bye.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.820]   Bye.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:06.820]   Bye.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.820]   Bye.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.880]   you
