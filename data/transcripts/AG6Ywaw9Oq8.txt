[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Pastor John, given the violence in the world at the hands of organized terrorism, a very
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.820]   prominent question on the minds of a lot of Christians is this.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.160]   Should we be praying for the conversion of ISIS, or should we be praying for their destruction?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.200]   What are some steps that we need to sort of walk through in order to answer this question?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   Let me answer in six steps.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:41.680]   Number one, there are God-inspired psalms which pray for the destruction and the damnation
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.640]   of enemies.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.720]   God-inspired men, inspired spokesmen of his choosing, to pray these psalms.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.760]   Let me read a little bit of Psalm 69, and I choose Psalm 69 because Paul quoted it in
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   this regard, and Jesus referred to it four times in relation to himself.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.080]   And it is one of the most severe imprecatory psalms.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200]   This is verses 22 following.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.320]   Let their own table before them become a snare, and when they are at peace, let it become
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.640]   a trap.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.440]   Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.360]   Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   May their camp be a desolation.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.560]   Let no one dwell in their tents, for they persecute him whom you have struck down, and
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.120]   they recount the pain of those whom you have wounded.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.840]   Add to them punishment upon punishment.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.800]   May they have no acquittal from you.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.040]   Let them be blotted out of the book of the living.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.520]   Let them not be enrolled among the righteous.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.360]   So there exist such psalms which God inspired that men pray.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.520]   Step two.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.640]   There are some situations in which a man, like David in Psalm 69, is right to speak
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.160]   words like these.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:28.080]   The situation we know of is when God moves a psalmist to pronounce his God's own judgment
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   rather than merely express personal vindictiveness.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   This is not a license.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   These psalms are not a license to make damnation pronouncements or desires without a clear
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   evidence that you are speaking for God and with God, from God.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.260]   That's step two.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.640]   Step three.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.300]   We should always approve the righteous judgments of God.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.920]   When we see that God has judged a person or people, we should approve.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.040]   It is blasphemy to criticize God for his judgments.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.100]   Or to put it differently, it is blasphemy to try to be more merciful than God.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   Step four.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:29.840]   When you have seen great and long hardness of heart, the time for praying for salvation
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.040]   might be over.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.740]   It might be.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.160]   It might not be.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.460]   I say this because of 1 John 5:16.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.960]   If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, pray,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.640]   and God will give him life.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.900]   There is sin that leads to death.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.600]   I do not say that one should pray for that.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.560]   He does not forbid prayer.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.160]   God is not forbidding prayer for such sinning, but he does not command it either.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.340]   I do not say one should pray for that.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.880]   There is a fine line, isn't there, between not praying for a person's life and praying
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.440]   for a person's death.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.000]   Step five.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.520]   You may have prayed earnestly for the conversion of members of Boko Haram, say if you live
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.960]   in Nigeria, or ISIS, or Al-Shabaab.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.320]   You may have prayed earnestly for their conversion, but now they are coming.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.760]   They're at the edge of your village with machetes, and they are cutting children in pieces and
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.300]   disemboweling women and beheading men on their way through the town.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.600]   In that moment of destruction, you might take up the words of Psalm 58 and pray them in
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   that instant.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.340]   "Knock the fangs out of their mouths, O God.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.000]   May they disperse like water running away.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.120]   May their machetes be dull and never find their mark.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.720]   May the rising sun melt them like a snail too slow to do its deadly work.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.080]   May they arrive at the house of the innocent like a stillborn child.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.600]   O God, save the poor from the violence of the wicked."
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   You may pray that.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.080]   Yes, you may.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.780]   Praying for damnation here would do little good for the village.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.200]   What you want is the destruction of their murderous force against the innocent.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Step six.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.280]   Jesus told us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.600]   Surely such a prayer would be a prayer for their salvation the way Paul did in Romans
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   10.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.760]   Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they might be saved.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.320]   Surely that is what we are to pray for our enemies.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.920]   And I should add a step seven, I suppose.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.800]   When our life is at stake, like Jesus on the cross or Stephen being stoned, when our life
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   is at stake and we are being killed, may the Lord give us the spirit of Stephen and of
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   Christ.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   Here's what Stephen said.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.760]   And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.840]   And falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.040]   against them."
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.920]   And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   Surely that's the way we would all like to die and live.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.960]   So let me ask a follow-up question that will be more relevant immediately to Western listeners.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   When you see those military videos, you know, these green videos, and you see a truck full
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.520]   of ISIS soldiers with machine guns getting blown to the sky in oblivion in a fireball,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.480]   what happens in your heart in that moment when you see that video?
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.600]   I don't know what happens from time to time.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.920]   I'm sure there is mixture.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:34.240]   I can describe sinful aspects of it, but I think what you're fishing for and appropriately
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.600]   would be, is there a good mixture of gladness and sorrow?
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.240]   And my understanding would be yes, and only God can see our hearts and know if we've arrived
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:58.400]   at the level of purity and godliness that we can delight for the right reasons in the
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:07.200]   destruction of a wicked path of life and wicked men, and sorrow simultaneously for something
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.040]   happening to them that we would not want to happen to ourselves, namely, they are lost.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.840]   They are going into eternity without Christ.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.360]   And I suppose if we pause to reflect and sort out our emotions, we might even be willing
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.120]   to say, "Would that they had been captured alive, put in prison, and been brought to
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.320]   Christ."
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   But in that moment, you are seeing a providence of God, perhaps even through sinful men.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.040]   I don't know who pushed the button or who aimed the rocket or what their motives were,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.040]   but a providence of God to end wicked life.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.400]   And you know that His judgments are right, and therefore in that moment there may be,
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   I think, an appropriate mingling of approval of that providential judgment and sorrow that
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.440]   they did not come to Christ.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   That's very sobering and good and balanced and eternally mindful.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
