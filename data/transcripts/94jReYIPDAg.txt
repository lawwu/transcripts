[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   what do you think it's going to take to make america healthy and this is not maha propaganda
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.800]   this is just can maha do it what do they need to do better what do they what can what can you do
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.100]   what can we all do great question and it was funny to me i was thinking as you're talking about how
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.040]   you know when michelle obama started her let's move campaign it was a blue issue a lot of the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.540]   people who were like pushing this agenda was shelly pingree who's a democrat from maine or
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.500]   mcgovern to mcgovern who's from massachusetts or cory booker introduced all these bills about food
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.980]   safety like the last congress and all of a sudden it's like it flipped and became a republican issue
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.860]   which is staggering to me and we now see bills and you know a few dozen states or more actually now
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.440]   every day i hear about new bills that are helping push forward an agenda to fix our food system and
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.720]   before you dive in i will i just want to see this answer with one thing forgive me audience they don't
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:04.020]   like it when i interrupt but the goal of the left if i may seems to be to make anyone associated with
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.740]   health and maha on the right a jock not a scientist yeah that's what i'm seeing they're trying to take
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.380]   away their science credential yeah and make them a jock now bobby kennedy is not a formerly trained
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.840]   scientist but um the scientists that are going into nih directorships who i can't share who they are
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.880]   besides jay it's been announced the other ones but you know who they are yeah these are serious
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.340]   scientists yeah these aren't jocks no these are people that may or may not lift weights these are
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.420]   but but there seems to be this effort to say we're going to we're going to strip maha of its power
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.740]   by making it a bro science biohacking jock thing real science is about reductionist stuff and i just say
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.020]   listen it's all it's all valuable yeah and so i'm i'm fundamentally frustrated and it hasn't even begun
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.940]   so educate us i mean listen you know uh my friend rick warren said i'm not left wing or right wing i'm
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.600]   for the whole bird otherwise you'll fly around in circles i like that and who said that rick warren
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.520]   you know who's rick warren is the head of saddleback church which is an evangelical church in southern
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.620]   california i we did a whole program with this church where we got a 15 000 people to lose a quarter
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.440]   million pounds in a year by doing health together in groups and it was it was amazing actually i love
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.220]   that quote it was a great quote and and you know health isn't red or blue or purple it's like a human
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.900]   issue and it's to make to make it partisan it doesn't make any sense to me and yet we live in a partisan
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.600]   world and anything the democrats do the republic is going to hate anything the republicans do the
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.440]   democrats are going to hate it's like hey guys can't we just talk to each other and have civil
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.700]   discourse and agree on the things we can agree on and disagree on the things we're going to disagree
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.640]   agree on and i and i know that i know behind the scenes there's collaboration bipartisan on these
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.240]   issues there's bipartisan caucus that well on the psychedelic issue i was at a meeting where you know
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   governor rick perry former governor rick perry texas like who describes himself as a knuckle-dragging
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   republican those are rick's words by the way rick's a very nice guy and there were several members of the
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   the dems there and you got rick doblin who is like a you know counterculture uh conscientious
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.800]   objector during the vietnam war and they're all up there being proponents for psychedelics for the
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.540]   treatment of ptsd and veterans so they've joined hands yeah i think that's one area that's very
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.620]   exciting yeah it's not happening in nutrition no it's not happening on this thing of get exercise
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.740]   those have become red labels yeah it's unfortunate because you know americans are suffering you know
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.520]   americans are really suffering those 93 percent of us have some metabolic dysfunction psychiatric
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   illnesses on the rise in both kids and adults autoimmune diseases are skyrocketing obviously
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.300]   obesity is a huge problem diabetes is a huge problem you know heart disease deaths are going down but the
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.820]   incidence is going up meaning you're there's more people getting it but because we have better
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.020]   treatments they don't die from it same thing with cancer so we're not winning on the health front in the
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.440]   war on on chronic disease we're losing disastrously and so we have to come together as a country to solve
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.960]   this and it's unfortunate men polarized i think i think the good part about um covid was that people
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.880]   became aware that this edifice of science and medicine had cracks in it and that they needed to
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.600]   be more empowered around their own health and to start questioning things and i think that's part of the
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.620]   genesis of this bigger wider movement around make america healthy again and why bobby kennedy was able to
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.620]   catalyze a huge base he was democratic candidate at first then he was independent now he's in the
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.520]   republican administration it doesn't mean he's shares all the ideology that they have but he cares about
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.880]   this issue and so i think i think what's happening and behind the scenes is there's a lot of bipartisan
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.800]   interest in how do we begin to address this look the health care bill is five trillion dollars
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.500]   of that the government federal government pays forty percent it's one in three federal tax dollars so
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.960]   one in three dollars you paid for your taxes goes to health care of that eighty percent is mostly for
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.080]   chronic disease that's either preventable or reversible through intensive lifestyle therapy
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.100]   and and you know some things are on the margins if insurance is private how does that work like how is
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.780]   it that my money is going to take care of somebody who has for example heart disease for example like like
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.120]   if you get on to medicare advantage and that's that's a government program but it's administered by
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.900]   humana or by cigna or by these insurance companies kind of deploy federal resources to deliver health care
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.380]   but if you actually look at the end-to-end with medicare medicaid indian health service federal
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.400]   employees children's health program you just add up all the things that the government pays for
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.580]   it's it's almost two trillion dollars a year for for health care most people don't realize that so
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.160]   the government has enormous levels and when i was sitting in my office treating my patients who are you
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.120]   know just endless stream of people with chronic illnesses coming diabetes obesity autoimmune disease this
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.600]   that the other thing i'm like why is this patient sick well it's mostly because of the food they're eating
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.440]   and if that's the problem then what's the cause of the food they're eating well it's our food policies
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.500]   and what's the cause of our food policies it's the food industry that has pressured our government
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.000]   to into creating a food system that's harming us and we have very different policies than they do in
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.540]   europe for example they don't allow many gmo foods or glyphosate they don't know they have those
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.320]   high fructose corn syrup they have it there but it's limited i mean more limited there's toxins
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.060]   there's 10 000 additives to food in america there's 400 that are allowed in europe
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:43.240]   so
