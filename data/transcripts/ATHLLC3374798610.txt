[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.140]   - Hello, and welcome to a special bonus episode
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.120]   of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.640]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.960]   and in my last episode,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.280]   I was joined by one of the most well-traveled friends
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.880]   I have, Lee Rowan,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.900]   where we had an amazing conversation all about Italy.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.480]   However, just a few weeks before we recorded,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.620]   Lee happened to have an amazing opportunity
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.520]   to take a trip to Antarctica,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.600]   which has been on my bucket list for years,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   and until our conversation,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   I don't think I'd ever met anyone
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   who'd actually been there.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.960]   So I couldn't help but ask him to stick around
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   and share why it was one of the most impactful trips
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160]   he's taken in his entire life,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.060]   and he's traveled a lot.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.400]   We'll talk about the experience,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.840]   what it's like there, how to get there,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.000]   and so much more.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   So without further ado,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.680]   let's get started right after this.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.720]   First off, Lee, thanks for sticking around
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.600]   and talking about Antarctica.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.440]   - Thank you.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.400]   I mean, we've gone from the heart of happiness
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.960]   and sunshine and warmth to a very cold place,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.480]   but it's a very good place,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.640]   and I'm excited to talk about it
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   and share the fact that out of all the places
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.280]   I've ever been in my entire life,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   I have never been moved,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960]   I have never been blown away and shocked
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.760]   as much as I have by my experience in Antarctica,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.400]   and I cannot wait to share why.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.840]   - So I wanna hear why,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.340]   but I will just preface this with,
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.860]   I'm fairly certain that anyone listening
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.840]   who's looking for a deal,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.000]   there is not a cheap way to do Antarctica.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.840]   Can we just set that as guideposts?
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.920]   'Cause I don't want people to listen to this,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680]   get really excited, and then be like,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.920]   how do I do this on a budget?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400]   - Well, there's two ways of doing Antarctica,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280]   and I'll talk about both really briefly.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.660]   One is flying into the continent, which is what I did.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.940]   I got very fortunate to go,
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.960]   and I'll explain more about what that experience is like
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.240]   and how later.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.560]   The second, of course, is cruising,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.520]   which is what most of the people
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120]   who go to visit the seventh continent do,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.200]   and that requires you to leave from Ushuaia
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.160]   or somewhere in South America,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.560]   take a two-day crossing across the Drake Passage,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.860]   which is usually a very harrowing experience
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.840]   for a lot of people,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240]   and then spend up to a week or 10 days
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.800]   exploring the Antarctic Peninsula
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.060]   before returning and going back to South America.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.280]   So all told, you're on a boat for about 14 days,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000]   seven to 10 of which are exploring Antarctica.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   Now, that general two-week experience
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.640]   or 10 to 14-day experience on a boat
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.200]   can cost anywhere between 10 and $100,000 for most people,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   and there are ways of actually lowering that cost.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.000]   If you're very flexible and you are okay
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.480]   kind of positioning yourself down in South America
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.540]   for a little bit,
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.720]   you can jump on a last-minute boat trip
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.920]   that has a cancellation,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   and you don't know where you're going
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.380]   or which voyage you're on,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.760]   but if you're down there,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   you can get that sometimes for half-off.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   So four or five grand for two weeks,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.780]   still a lot of money,
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.880]   but it's not as bad as it could be
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.200]   if you were paying full retail.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680]   Now, most of the people who book these cruises to Antarctica,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.920]   they do so well in advance,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.840]   12 to 18 to sometimes even 24 months out,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.880]   and so when you look at that booking window,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.560]   the fact that you might be down in South America
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.380]   and in two days hop on something that wasn't available
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.300]   kind of comes as a shock to some people,
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.000]   but that's the way you can do it on a sort of deal.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Otherwise, expect to plan, budget, save,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.880]   and then go eventually down the line.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.080]   - The first option you mentioned
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.320]   that you were fortunate to do,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.640]   I assume that starts at a higher floor.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.480]   - A little higher.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.200]   So there used to be a few operators
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.600]   who would fly into the interior of Antarctica
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.320]   who could take you all the way sometimes to the South Pole.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120]   That number has now been reduced down to zero
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.200]   or one in this case.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.100]   A company called White Desert out of South Africa.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.200]   White Desert was founded by a fellow
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.680]   who has done pretty much everything to get to the pole
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.000]   or around Antarctica.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.480]   So he skied, he packed a sled, he took a kite,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.360]   next year he's gonna bring a hovercraft.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.000]   He's pretty incredible.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And so he set up a polar expedition experience on Antarctica
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.760]   that is unlike anything else that's out there,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.440]   and it does involve flying either an A340,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.920]   an Airbus jumbo jet, or a G550, a Gulfstream private jet
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.220]   from Cape Town down to Antarctica.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.400]   And he actually, this is really incredible,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.780]   he set up one of the only private blue ice runways
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.920]   in the world.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   What's a blue ice runway?
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.760]   - I'm just imagining a giant A340 landing on ice.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.560]   - I was on it, and it's incredible
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.960]   because when you land on that ice runway,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.120]   which has been groomed for almost a day straight,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.560]   they take a snowcat and they pull it along
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.040]   at about three miles an hour,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.880]   and they just build these ruts into the ice
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.800]   on this glacier.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.600]   And they smooth this runway perfectly
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   so that a jumbo jet, flying at almost 200 miles an hour
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.720]   when it lands, can land and has the right friction
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   to grab the wheels and slow it down.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.480]   And so it's a 3,000 meter runway,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.360]   and so almost 10,000 feet.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.880]   And when we landed, we only used half of the runway,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.280]   which is insane.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.920]   We're landing on an A340 with four engines, fully loaded,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   and the thing landed like smooth,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.640]   as if you were landing at SFO.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   It was incredible.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.520]   And then, of course, you step out and you're like,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.000]   "Whoa, I'm on Mars, this is not Earth.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.520]   "This is something totally different."
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.720]   Because the advantage of flying into the interior
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.440]   is that, number one, fewer than 300 people a year do it.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.720]   Unless you're a scientist stationed at a base somewhere,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.000]   you don't have a chance, as a tourist,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   to really go into the interior of Antarctica.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360]   The boats only reach the coast,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   and they only go a couple hundred feet inland at most.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   This, you're 150 kilometers from the shelf, from the sea,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.200]   when you land on the A340 on the ice.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.120]   And then you fly around from there in other aircraft.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.440]   They use a converted DC-3 Basler, it's called.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.720]   These Canadian guys fly it all the way from Canada,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.400]   where it's stationed in the Northern Hemisphere, summer.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.120]   They bring it all the way down to the Antarctic in the fall,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.200]   switches to spring when it gets down to South America,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.560]   and then come early November, it's on the ice.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.200]   And they fly it all around the Antarctic continent.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.520]   You can go to the South Pole.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.980]   I unfortunately did not get a chance to do that on my trip.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.220]   It's a seven hour journey, one way, in the plane.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.960]   And you actually stop along the way,
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   because you have to pick up more fuel.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.520]   This is the crazy part about Antarctica,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   that it just boggles my mind.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   How do you get fuel?
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.440]   - Yeah, I was just thinking, there's not a gas station.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.680]   - Right, right.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.860]   So what they do is, once a year,
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.740]   they bring a ship from Cape Town,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.240]   down to the Antarctic shelf.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.520]   And it unloads with this giant crane,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.380]   containers of fuel, and a hovercraft, and food,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.400]   and whatever else they need to bring.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.640]   They leave it on the ice,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   and then they begin, basically, a convoy,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.680]   to bring that fuel, and that stuff,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.440]   down to where it needs to go.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   So it goes from the continent's shelf,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.500]   all the way down to 83 degrees South,
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.760]   which is like a 45 day, one way journey.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.080]   Can you imagine?
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.640]   Imagine these guys were like, driving a snowcat,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.720]   it's fully sunny all day,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.300]   and they're just driving it south for 45 days,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.840]   just to drop fuel, so that you can fly
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.160]   to the South Pole for an hour.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.320]   It's mind boggling, right?
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.820]   The whole thing is incredible.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.340]   So, anyway, we didn't get to do that.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.420]   We did get to fly those Baslers to the coast,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.740]   to see penguins.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.160]   And when I say penguins, I mean,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940]   I saw emperor penguins, freshly hatched, little chicks,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.540]   who obviously had never seen humans before,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.780]   because we were some of the first in the season
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.240]   to visit their colony.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   In the entire year, they maybe will get 150 visitors, ever.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.220]   I mean, it's insane, right?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.900]   So you literally feel like you're on a different planet.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.820]   You're not seeing humans for a week at a time.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.860]   You're doing your own thing.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.700]   You're in your own space.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.800]   And you feel like, wow, I've left Earth.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.440]   And yet you come back at night into these luxury digs,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.260]   where you're sleeping in an explorer tent with fine linen,
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.540]   and there's like sparkling water.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.060]   And if you want wine, there's wine.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.980]   And there's this creature comforts to take care of you.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.580]   But the actual logistics of the experience
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.680]   are just mind blowing.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.940]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.780]   I get it.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.340]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.220]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.360]   for a good hang.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.380]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.320]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.260]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.040]   take care of the supplies.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.860]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.700]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.120]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.100]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.580]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.640]   that you got through another week.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.740]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.300]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.060]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.140]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.820]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.380]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.360]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.400]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.220]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.300]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.940]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.420]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.060]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.340]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.340]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.600]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.440]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.180]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.000]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.620]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.140]   without our consent.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.100]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.220]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.940]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.460]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.600]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.420]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.580]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.820]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.140]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.100]   for this episode.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.060]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.140]   and remove your personal information
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.900]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.020]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.660]   and get that removed as well.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.860]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.300]   of data for a customer in their first two years,
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.940]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.300]   of data for their customers.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.860]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.860]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.820]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme and get 20% off a plan
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.420]   for you or your entire family.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.340]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.260]   - How would someone who I guess probably has saved a lot
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.580]   even consider going on this?
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.540]   You said it's down to zero, one.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.860]   Is this an expedition that people can go on?
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.460]   So there's one provider, White Desert,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.400]   who does this on a yearly basis.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.840]   They have three camps that they operate in Antarctica,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.140]   in the interior.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.340]   And you sign up through either your travel advisor
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.900]   or directly with them on their website
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.500]   to sign up for which experience and expedition camp
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.740]   you wanna stay at.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.500]   One is a space-agey kind of camp.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.220]   One is located on an oasis.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.180]   An oasis in the Antarctic term means a rock outcropping,
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.340]   not ice.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.860]   So that's kind of weird because we think of an oasis
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.660]   as a place that would have water in a desert, vice versa.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.860]   The desert in Antarctica is all the ice all around you.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.280]   They only get a few centimeters of snow per year
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.100]   on this glacial cap.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.220]   But the rock facing is only about 2% of Antarctica,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.620]   and those are called oases.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.900]   And that's where they actually built one of their camps.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.820]   You can spend time there,
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.980]   or you can spend time at their sort of runway base.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.060]   But yeah, you basically, you save up your money.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.180]   Their trip started around $50,000 US per person,
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.060]   double occupancy.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.540]   So that's per person in a two-person room.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.860]   I heard stories when we were down there
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.060]   of people who had saved up for three or four years.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.500]   This was their vacation fund.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.140]   They put away year over year over year,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.460]   and this was their incredible trip they took.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.860]   Some people have crowdsourced or crowdfunded a trip
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.780]   to go down there.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.740]   - Some people have started luxury travel companies.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.740]   - And got very lucky and knew the right person
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.580]   at the right time.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.540]   They have an incredible product
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.260]   that is definitely worth those dollars
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.700]   and worth that experience.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.700]   What's really incredible that I thought
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.420]   about the Antarctic Peninsula versus the Antarctic interior
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.020]   is that there's a sort of a circuit you can do
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.060]   on the Antarctic Peninsula
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.700]   where you're gonna see the same colonies,
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.140]   the same islands, the same glaciers,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.740]   as every other boat that comes through that area.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.540]   Whereas in the interior, you'd wake up in the morning
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.340]   and then you'd be like, "Well, what do you wanna do today?"
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.700]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.140]   And you had a list of options of,
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.700]   oh, you could abseil down a mountain,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.900]   or you could climb a mountain
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.060]   that maybe only a hundred people ever have climbed.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.580]   Or you could take a flight seeing trip
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.700]   where you go out in the Basler
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.700]   and you go flight see out to different parts
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.180]   of the Antarctic interior.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.580]   And you could land places where you were the only human
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.340]   and you were confident in seeing this
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.660]   that has ever landed there and climbed that rock
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.100]   or that Nunatuk or that mountain.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.580]   It was insane to think that's something
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.740]   that was just accessible to you that you could do.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.740]   So I think that the scale, you are infinitesimally small,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.100]   you are insignificant and nothing amongst this ice
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.300]   and amongst this, wow, it was just so mind boggling for me
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.380]   and so beautiful and so humbling.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.540]   - Do you think if you'd done the cruise,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540]   you would have had a similar experience?
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.340]   I feel like at this point, you're like,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.100]   interior was such a more magical experience,
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.540]   but I imagine very few people are gonna have
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.140]   the two-person $100,000 budget, myself included,
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.700]   to do that, is doing a cruise
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.300]   and cutting that cost significantly
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.980]   still gonna be as magical?
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.420]   - So I personally am not cruised,
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.260]   but I know a lot of my clients who have,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.540]   and I know a lot of my fellow travel industry folks
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.700]   who have talked about the same life-changing experience.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.140]   That they go down to the ice,
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.700]   they're surrounded by these colonies of penguins,
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.180]   and even if there are other boats
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.300]   and there's other people around,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.020]   it's just this overwhelming sense of, God, I'm so small.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.060]   And I'm just seeing this field of view in front of me
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.620]   that is so massive, and yet I am a little person.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.740]   So I definitely think there's that overview effect element
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.620]   that people get when they go to Antarctica.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.180]   It's exotic, it's crazy, it's uninhabited,
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.480]   it's so otherworldly in so many ways.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.940]   And it's always a place that people come back from and say,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.740]   I'm so grateful that I had a chance to do this,
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.020]   I'm so glad I did this.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.380]   No one ever says, well, that was a long boat ride
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.260]   for nothing, it's always very, very positive
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.100]   about the experience.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.860]   And really, look, no matter which way you choose to do it,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.980]   whether you go on a research ship
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.460]   or a super high-end yacht or boat,
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.660]   or you go fly in to the interior,
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.260]   no matter what, your experience will be incredible
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.180]   because you've never done this before.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.980]   This is something absolutely out of the ordinary.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.220]   And I asked Patrick, the fellow who set up White Desert,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.500]   who's the explorer, who's gone to all the poles,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.620]   and he's gone everywhere.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.780]   And I said, what is it that keeps you
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.540]   coming back to Antarctica?
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.660]   And he couldn't put his finger
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.940]   on just one particular thing.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.300]   It's just this grandness and this opportunity
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.480]   to explore and see an experience
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.140]   that is just so overwhelming.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.980]   There's just so much down there.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.780]   And it's the majesty and the space,
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.060]   it's just really quite incredible.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.740]   - Wow, probably not a good one for the young kids, but--
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   - Kids eight and older.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.660]   - Eight and older, so I've got seven years
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.380]   to save up for a trip to Antarctica.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.740]   - Or just leaving home.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.100]   - Yeah, find childcare, we can sneak away,
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.580]   and find time for a two-week boat adventure,
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.580]   which means they're probably gonna need
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.620]   to be a little bit older.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.460]   - Exactly.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.080]   - I think it's hard to find any family member
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.540]   that wants to watch your children for two weeks
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.060]   while you go on a nice cruise.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.300]   - Well, the nice part is you could leave them
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.560]   back in Cape Town, and you could fly with White Desert,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.340]   and you're only on the ice for four, five, six nights.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.740]   And we'll need the seven years to save for it anyways.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.580]   - That's right.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.700]   - Yeah, not gonna crowdfund that,
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.820]   although maybe I can at least call it a business expense.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.660]   - You never know.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.500]   - So.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.320]   - Talk to your tax advisor.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.160]   We've had a few on the show.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.100]   I will say one last thing, which is that
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.820]   there's a slight chance that the White Desert folks
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.560]   are gonna be putting together a very cool,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.460]   round-the-world, all-seven-continents-in-one-month
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.860]   private jet expedition.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.260]   And it wouldn't be marginally much more expensive
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.780]   than one of their traditional trips to the ice,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.100]   but it would touch all seven continents
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.540]   in the span of about 21, 24 days.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.580]   So keep an eye out on that.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.060]   That may be coming sometime next year.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.340]   - Any other parting Antarctica advice?
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.020]   - One of the things that I felt so grateful for
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.140]   coming back from the ice was that
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.160]   the things we take for granted,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.100]   having an Amazon delivery, right,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.040]   or having trash just taken out,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.300]   are truly things of a cooperative society
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.820]   and of innovative companies that make our lives so easy.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.540]   And when you're forced to create that all on your own
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.980]   in a unique environment like Antarctica,
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.940]   where their trash is taken out once a year,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.180]   and so literally the very minimal trash
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.200]   I created into Antarctica is gonna stay there
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.940]   until next December, and then it'll get taken to Cape Town.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.980]   Just that logistical idea alone blows my mind.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.700]   We live in a space and in a place and in an age
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.580]   where we're like, these things are just like second nature
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.860]   and we just think, oh yeah, we can recycle something
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.100]   or throw something away or get something delivered tomorrow.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.820]   And that's an incredible luxury.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.820]   I had to go a very far distance
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.740]   and spend a lot of money and blah, blah, blah
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.540]   to realize how luxurious I have it at home.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.640]   - Wow.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.460]   I do have two questions that are probably pretty normal.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.420]   How cold and how bright?
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.060]   - So bright.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.740]   Oh my God, so bright.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.380]   So the disorienting thing for me was that
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.500]   obviously we're underneath the Antarctic Circle,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.820]   24 hours of daylight.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.140]   The sun does move.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.420]   It doesn't just stay right overhead
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.920]   like it does at the South Pole.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.900]   It moves around in sort of like a oval shape.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.220]   The vistas are so wide
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.740]   that it doesn't go down below any of the mountains
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.460]   'cause in most places you're 30 to 50 miles away
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.940]   from mountains that look like you could reach out
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.340]   and touch them, but they're super far away.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.940]   So the brightness is real, obviously from the sun,
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.780]   but also from sun glare off of the snow.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.580]   So you have to wear specialized glasses
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.300]   that really wrap around any open area,
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.060]   including your nose, where sun could get in
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.300]   because otherwise it zaps your eyes.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.820]   So even like the moments of like,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.640]   I'd like briefly take off my glasses,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.380]   I'd be like, whoa, like put them back on
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.540]   'cause it's intense.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.340]   Sunscreen as well, put sunscreen everywhere
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.640]   'cause you will burn any single spot that is exposed.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.180]   Cold is an interesting thing.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.700]   Cold is relative to how much wind there is.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.280]   Standing on ice, obviously you're at about zero Celsius
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.260]   or a little below.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.420]   When the wind blows, you're at very cold very fast.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.620]   And they have these things called katabatic winds,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.700]   which is basically when the wind picks up
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.440]   in what would be the afternoon.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.180]   There is time by the way, but there's no time zone.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.200]   It's very strange.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.060]   But anyway, in the afternoons, the winds would pick up,
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.400]   they'd come from the South.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.020]   So blowing from the South North,
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.300]   from the South Pole up towards where we were,
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.100]   it could get pretty windy pretty fast.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.720]   If so, you get these little shards of ice and snow
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.620]   that whip off of the glacier
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.780]   and they feel like exploiting treatments.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.880]   They're strong, but with a good wind jacket on
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.180]   and like a face buffer, you're fine.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.540]   So we were out skiing and up sailing
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.260]   and having fun in strong winds.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.660]   Wind chill wise, it could go down to negative 10,
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.300]   negative 15 Celsius like that.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.500]   I never felt cold.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.860]   There were days where I felt hot,
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.820]   where we'd be hiking up and down a glacier or a hill
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.860]   and I'd like take off layers 'cause it's toasty.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.180]   - But because you were working.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.060]   - 'Cause we were working out, we were well-dressed.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.420]   You definitely take care of yourself in the surroundings.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.220]   There was one night where I walked from my pod
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.700]   where I slept to like the communal pod
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.100]   where everyone was like having dinner and hanging out
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.380]   and I wore sandals as a joke and my toes got a little cold.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.420]   - And you said time zone,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.180]   like is there a time zone in Antarctica
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.020]   or how does that work?
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.860]   - There is, so each scientific base that's down there
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.100]   chooses their own time
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.200]   based on where their sort of home country is.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.620]   So we were closest to an Indian base and they chose GMT.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.620]   They chose London time.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.580]   We were on London time as well,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.700]   but we were technically like one time zone over
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.460]   and South Africa was one time zone further from us.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.940]   There's a Russian base down there that chooses Russian time
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.020]   even though they're on the other side
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.600]   of the world from Russia.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.340]   There's obviously a lot of US bases
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.920]   and they choose New Zealand or US time.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.180]   So it just depends on where you're sort of aligned.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.980]   - But you could conceivably get in one of these planes,
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.140]   fly from one place to the other in the middle of the day,
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.440]   but when you get there, everyone's sleeping.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.100]   - Totally, and that's the disorienting part
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.180]   is that like you wake up at two in the morning
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.380]   to have a glass of water and like it is bright out.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.900]   And I'm not saying bright, I mean like sun is overhead.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.900]   - Wow, thanks for doing a little bonus here.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.740]   - Thank you.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.780]   - On a place that most people don't get to go.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.300]   - Yeah, I hope more people will get to go.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.160]   It is truly magical and fascinating
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.740]   and well worth your investment.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.620]   Save your time, save your money and go.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.700]   - All right, thanks for being here.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.540]   - Thank you.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.860]   - I hope you like this little bonus episode on Antarctica.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.980]   I have mixed feelings because now I really wanna go,
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.660]   but wow, is it really expensive.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.980]   So no idea how I'm gonna make that happen,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.500]   but it still remains on my bucket list,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.660]   so we'll see what happens.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.500]   See you next week.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.840]   (whooshing)
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
