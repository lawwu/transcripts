[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.140]   - Hello and welcome to a special bonus episode
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.100]   of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.640]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.960]   And in my last episode,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.280]   I was joined by one of the most well-traveled friends
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.880]   I have, Lee Rowan,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.900]   where we had an amazing conversation all about Italy.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.480]   However, just a few weeks before we recorded,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.620]   Lee happened to have an amazing opportunity
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.520]   to take a trip to Antarctica,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.600]   which has been on my bucket list for years.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   And until our conversation,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   I don't think I'd ever met anyone
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   who'd actually been there.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.960]   So I couldn't help but ask him to stick around
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   and share why it was one of the most impactful trips
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160]   he's taken in his entire life.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.060]   And he's traveled a lot.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.400]   We'll talk about the experience,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.000]   what it's like there, how to get there and so much more.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.380]   So without further ado,
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.540]   let's get started right after this.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.200]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.540]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.700]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.720]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.940]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.580]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.680]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.960]   for this episode.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.800]   Anyday is glass cookware,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.440]   specially designed to make delicious food
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.620]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.640]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.280]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   and you can cook, serve, store and reheat
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.360]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.600]   freezer and oven safe too.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.200]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.400]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.680]   So you should definitely check that out.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.020]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.080]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday

[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.520]   First off Lee, thanks for sticking around
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.380]   and talking about Antarctica.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.220]   Thank you.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.180]   I mean, we've gone from the heart of happiness
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.720]   and sunshine and warmth to a very cold place,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240]   but it's a very good place.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400]   And I'm excited to talk about it
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.360]   and share the fact that out of all the places
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   I've ever been in my entire life,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.680]   I have never been moved.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.720]   I've never been blown away and shocked
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.520]   as much as I have by my experience in Antarctica.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.160]   And I cannot wait to share why.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.100]   So I wanna hear why, but I will just preface this with,
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.620]   I'm fairly certain that anyone listening
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.600]   who's looking for a deal,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.760]   there is not a cheap way to do Antarctica.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   Can we just set that as guideposts?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   'Cause I don't want people to listen to this,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.480]   get really excited and then be like,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.700]   how do I do this on a budget?
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.160]   Well, there's two ways of doing Antarctica.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040]   And I'll talk about both really briefly.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.400]   One is flying into the continent, which is what I did.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.440]   I got very fortunate to go and I'll explain more
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000]   about what that experience is like and how later.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.320]   The second of course is cruising,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.340]   which is what most of the people who go to visit
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.920]   the seventh continent do.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   And that requires you to leave from Ushuaia
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.920]   or somewhere in South America,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.320]   take a two day crossing across the Drake Passage,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.620]   which is usually a very harrowing experience
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.600]   for a lot of people.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.000]   And then spend up to a week or 10 days
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.560]   exploring the Antarctic Peninsula
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.800]   before returning and going back to South America.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.040]   So all told you're on a boat for about 14 days,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.760]   seven to 10 of which are exploring Antarctica.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.280]   Now that general two week experience
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.400]   or 10 to 14 day experience on a boat
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.960]   can cost anywhere between 10 and $100,000 for most people.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.320]   And there are ways of actually lowering that cost.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.760]   If you're very flexible and you are okay
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.240]   kind of positioning yourself down in South America
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.480]   for a little bit, you can jump on a last minute boat trip
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   that has a cancellation and you don't know where you're going
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.520]   or which voyage you're on, but if you're down there,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.420]   you can get that sometimes for half off.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.540]   So four or five grand for two weeks, still a lot of money,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.660]   but it's not as bad as it could be
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.960]   if you were paying full retail.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.440]   Now, most of the people who book these cruises to Antarctica,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.520]   they do so well in advance, 12 to 18,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.600]   to sometimes even 24 months out.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.640]   And so when you look at that booking window,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.320]   the fact that you might be down in South America
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.140]   and in two days hop on something that wasn't available
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.040]   kind of comes as a shock to some people,
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.760]   but that's the way you can do it on a sort of deal.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   Otherwise expect to plan, budget, save,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.640]   and then go eventually down the line.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.840]   - The first option you mentioned
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.080]   that you were fortunate to do,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.400]   I assume that starts at a higher floor.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.240]   - A little higher.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   So there used to be a few operators
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.360]   who would fly into the interior of Antarctica
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.080]   who could take you all the way sometimes to the South Pole.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.900]   That number has now been reduced down to zero
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.960]   or one in this case.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.860]   A company called White Desert out of South Africa.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.960]   White Desert was founded by a fellow
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.460]   who has done pretty much everything to get to the pole
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.800]   or around Antarctica.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.280]   So he skied, he packed a sled, he took a kite.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.160]   Next year he's gonna bring a hovercraft.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   He's pretty incredible.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   And so he set up a polar expedition experience on Antarctica
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.520]   that is unlike anything else that's out there.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.200]   And it does involve flying either an A340,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.680]   an Airbus jumbo jet, or a G550, a Gulfstream private jet
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.000]   from Cape Town down to Antarctica.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   And he actually, this is really incredible.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.860]   He set up one of the only private
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.700]   blue ice runways in the world.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.060]   What's a blue ice runway?
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.580]   - I'm just imagining a giant A340 landing on ice.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.340]   - I was on it and it's incredible
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.780]   because when you land on that ice runway,
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   which has been groomed for almost a day straight,
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.340]   they take a snowcat and they pull it along
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.260]   at about three miles an hour and they just
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.580]   (imitates snowcat)
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.580]   build these ruts into the ice on this glacier.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.380]   And they smooth this runway perfectly
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.660]   so that a jumbo jet flying at almost 200 miles an hour
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.500]   when it lands can land and has the right friction
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.620]   to grab the wheels and slow it down.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.260]   And so it's a 3,000 meter runway,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.100]   and so almost 10,000 feet.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.640]   And when we landed, we only used half of the runway,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.060]   which is insane.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.660]   We're landing on an A340 with four engines, fully loaded.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.660]   And the thing landed like smooth
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.420]   as if you were landing at SFO.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.420]   It was incredible.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.300]   And then of course you step out and you're like,
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.860]   "Whoa, I'm on Mars, this is not Earth."
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.300]   This is something totally different
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.500]   because the advantage of flying into the interior
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.220]   is that number one, fewer than 300 people a year do it.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.500]   Unless you're a scientist stationed at a base somewhere,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.780]   you don't have a chance as a tourist
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.260]   to really go into the interior of Antarctica.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.140]   The boats only reach the coast
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.980]   and they only go a couple hundred feet inland at most.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.820]   This, you're 150 kilometers from the shelf, from the sea,
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.020]   when you land on the A340 on the ice.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.900]   And then you fly around from there in other aircraft.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.220]   They use a converted DC-3 Basler, it's called.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.500]   These Canadian guys fly it all the way from Canada
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.220]   where it's stationed in the Northern Hemisphere summer.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.900]   They bring it all the way down to the Antarctic in the fall,
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.000]   switches to spring when it gets down to South America,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.340]   and then come early November, it's on the ice.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.980]   And they fly it all around the Antarctic continent.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.300]   You can go to the South Pole.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.780]   I unfortunately did not get a chance to do that on my trip.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.720]   It's a seven hour journey one way.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.020]   In the plane.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.760]   And you actually stop along the way
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.740]   because you have to pick up more fuel.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.340]   This is the crazy part about Antarctica
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.540]   that just boggles my mind.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.580]   How do you get fuel?
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.220]   - Yeah, I was just thinking, there's not a gas station.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.460]   - Right, right.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.660]   So what they do is once a year,
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.540]   they bring a ship from Cape Town
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.040]   down to the Antarctic shelf.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.300]   And it unloads with this giant crane,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.180]   containers of fuel and a hovercraft and food
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.180]   and whatever else they need to bring.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.420]   They leave it on the ice.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.980]   And then they begin basically a convoy
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.460]   to bring that fuel and that stuff
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.200]   down to where it needs to go.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.160]   So it goes from the continent shelf
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.260]   all the way down to 83 degrees South,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.540]   which is like a 45 day one way journey.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.860]   Can you imagine?
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.420]   Imagine these guys are like driving a snowcat.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.500]   It's fully sunny all day
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.060]   and they're just driving it South for 45 days
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.580]   just to drop fuel so that you can fly
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.900]   to the South Pole for an hour.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.100]   It's mind boggling, right?
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.580]   The whole thing is incredible.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.100]   So anyway, we didn't get to do that.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.140]   We did get to fly those Baslers to the coast
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.460]   to see penguins.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.880]   And when I say penguins, I mean,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.660]   I saw emperor penguins, freshly hatched little chicks
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.260]   who obviously had never seen humans before
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.500]   because we were some of the first in the season
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.980]   to visit their colony.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.980]   In the entire year, they maybe will get 150 visitors ever.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.960]   I mean, it's insane, right?
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.620]   So you literally feel like you're on a different planet.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.540]   You're not seeing humans for a week at a time.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.580]   You're doing your own thing.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.420]   You're in your own space.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.540]   And you feel like, wow, I've left earth.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.180]   And yet you come back at night into these luxury digs
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.000]   where you're sleeping in a explorer tent with fine linen.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.260]   And there's like sparkling water.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.780]   And if you want wine, there's wine.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.700]   And there's this creature comforts to take care of you.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.300]   But the actual logistics of the experience
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.460]   are just mind blowing.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.620]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.100]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.700]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.140]   in your situation,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.740]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.020]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.860]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.020]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.540]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.940]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.900]   I've loved being a part of the community.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.220]   And I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.340]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.700]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.420]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.220]   are first generation wealth,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.300]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.460]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.780]   and learn from each other
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.380]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.660]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.020]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.420]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.580]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.540]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.060]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.500]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.820]   to your children's education,
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.140]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.580]   So many of these conversations
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.820]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.460]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.340]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.500]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.580]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.700]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.220]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.180]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.260]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.020]   Did you know that someone new
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.540]   gets impacted by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.340]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.980]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.500]   without our consent.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.460]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.420]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.260]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.820]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.940]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.780]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.940]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.180]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.500]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.460]   for this episode.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.220]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.500]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.300]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.420]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.060]   and get that removed as well.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.000]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.380]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.860]   in their first two years.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.740]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.700]   for their customers.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.740]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.240]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.260]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.800]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.720]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.660]   - How would someone who I guess probably has saved a lot
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   even consider going on this?
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   You said it's down to zero, one.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.260]   Is this an expedition that people can go on?
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.100]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.860]   So there's one provider, White Desert,
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.780]   who does this on a yearly basis.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.220]   They have three camps that they operate in Antarctica,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.540]   in the interior.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.740]   And you sign up through either your travel advisor
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.280]   or directly with them on their website
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.940]   to sign up for which experience
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.100]   and expedition camp you wanna stay at.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.900]   One is a space-agey kind of camp.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.620]   One is located on an oasis.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.580]   An oasis in the Antarctic term means a rock outcropping,
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.700]   not ice.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.220]   So that's kind of weird because we think of an oasis
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.340]   as a place that would have water in a desert.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.220]   Vice versa, the desert in Antarctica
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.260]   is all the ice all around you.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.660]   They only get a few centimeters of snow per year
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.500]   on this glacial cap.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.620]   But the rock facing is only about 2% of Antarctica,
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.000]   and those are called oases.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.260]   And that's where they actually built one of their camps.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.220]   You can spend time there,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.380]   or you can spend time at their sort of runway base.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.460]   But yeah, you basically, you save up your money.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.580]   Their trip started around $50,000 per person,
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.460]   double occupancy.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.940]   So that's per person in a two-person room.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.260]   I heard stories when we were down there
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.500]   of people who had saved up for three or four years.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.940]   This was their vacation fund.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.540]   They put away year over year over year,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.900]   and this was their incredible trip they took.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.220]   Some people have crowdsourced
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.220]   or crowdfunded a trip to go down there.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.180]   - Some people have started luxury travel companies.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.180]   - And got very lucky and knew the right person
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.020]   at the right time.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.940]   But they have an incredible product
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.680]   that is definitely worth those dollars
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.140]   and worth that experience.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.120]   What's really incredible that I thought
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.820]   about the Antarctic Peninsula versus the Antarctic interior
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.460]   is that there's a sort of a circuit you can do
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.480]   on the Antarctic Peninsula
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.100]   where you're gonna see the same colonies,
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.540]   the same islands, the same glaciers
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.140]   as every other boat that comes through that area.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.940]   Whereas in the interior, you'd wake up in the morning
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.740]   and then you'd be like, "Well, what do you wanna do today?"
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.100]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.540]   And you had a list of options of,
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.100]   oh, you could abseil down a mountain,
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.300]   or you could climb a mountain
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.460]   that maybe only 100 people ever have climbed.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.980]   Or you could take a flight seeing trip
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.100]   where you go out in the basilar
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.100]   and you go flight see out to different parts
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.580]   of the Antarctic interior.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.980]   And you could land places where you were the only human
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.740]   and you were confident in seeing this
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.040]   that has ever landed there and climbed that rock
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.480]   or that Nunatuq or that mountain.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.960]   It was insane to think that's something
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.120]   that it was just accessible to you that you could do.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.120]   So I think that the scale, you are infinitesimally small,
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   you are insignificant and nothing amongst this ice
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.000]   and amongst this, wow.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.680]   It was just so mind boggling for me
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.760]   and so beautiful and so humbling.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.920]   - Do you think if you'd done the cruise,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   you would have had a similar experience?
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   I feel like at this point, you're like,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.480]   interior was such a more magical experience,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.920]   but I imagine very few people are gonna have
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.520]   the two person $100,000 budget, myself included,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.080]   to do that, is doing a cruise
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.680]   and cutting that cost significantly
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.360]   still gonna be as magical?
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.800]   - So I personally am not cruised,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.680]   but I know a lot of my clients who have.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.940]   And I know a lot of my fellow travel industry folks
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.080]   who have talked about the same life changing experience.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.520]   That they go down to the ice,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.080]   they're surrounded by these colonies of penguins.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.560]   And even if there are other boats
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   and there's other people around,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.400]   it's just this overwhelming sense of, God, I'm so small.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.440]   And I'm just seeing this field of view in front of me
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.000]   that is so massive and yet I am, little person.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.120]   So I definitely think there's that overview effect element
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.040]   that people get when they go to Antarctica.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.560]   It's exotic, it's crazy, it's uninhabited,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.880]   it's so otherworldly in so many ways.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.320]   And it's always a place that people come back from and say,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.120]   I'm so grateful that I had a chance to do this.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.400]   I'm so glad I did this.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.480]   No one ever says like, ah, well,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.800]   that was a long boat ride for nothing.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   It's always very, very positive about the experience.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.240]   And really look, no matter which way you choose to do it,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.360]   whether you go on a research ship
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.840]   or a super high-end yacht or boat,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.040]   or you go fly in to the interior,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.640]   no matter what, your experience will be incredible
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.560]   because you've never done this before.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.360]   This is something absolutely out of the ordinary.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.620]   And I asked Patrick, the fellow who set up White Desert,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.880]   who's the explorer, who's gone to all the poles,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.000]   and he's gone everywhere.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.160]   And I said, what is it that keeps you
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.920]   coming back to Antarctica?
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.040]   And he couldn't put his finger
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.320]   on just one particular thing.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.680]   It's just this grandness and this opportunity
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.880]   to explore and see an experience
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.560]   that is just so overwhelming.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.360]   There's just so much down there.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.160]   And it's the majesty and the space.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.440]   It's just really quite incredible.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.120]   Wow. Probably not a good one for the young kids, but--
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.100]   Kids eight and older.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.940]   Eight and older.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.600]   So I've got seven years to save up
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.760]   for a trip to Antarctica.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.120]   Or just leaving home.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   Find childcare, we can sneak away,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.960]   and find time for a two-week boat adventure,
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   which means they're probably gonna need
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   to be a little bit older.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.800]   Exactly.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.440]   I think it's hard to find any family member
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   that wants to watch your children for two weeks
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.440]   while you go on a nice cruise.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.660]   Well, the nice part is you could leave them
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.920]   back in Cape Town, and you could fly with White Desert,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.680]   and you're only on the ice for four, five, six nights.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.080]   And we'll need the seven years to save for it anyways.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.920]   That's right.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.580]   Not gonna crowdfund that,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.160]   although maybe I could at least call it a business expense.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.000]   You never know.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.840]   So.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.660]   Talk to your tax advisor.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.500]   We've had a few on the show.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.680]   I will say one last thing,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.220]   which is that there's a slight chance
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.400]   that the White Desert folks are gonna be putting together
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.560]   a very cool, round-the-world, all-seven-continents,
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.200]   in-one-month private jet expedition.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.600]   And it wouldn't be marginally much more expensive
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.120]   than one of their traditional trips to the ice,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.440]   but it would touch all seven continents
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.920]   in the span of about 21, 24 days.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   So keep an eye out on that.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.440]   That may be coming sometime next year.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.700]   Any other parting Antarctica advice?
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.400]   One of the things that I felt so grateful for
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.520]   coming back from the ice was that
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   the things we take for granted,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.440]   having an Amazon delivery, right?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.380]   Or having trash just taken out,
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.680]   are truly things of a cooperative society
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.160]   and of innovative companies that make our lives so easy.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.920]   And when you're forced to create that all on your own
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.320]   in a unique environment like Antarctica,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.280]   where their trash is taken out once a year,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.540]   and so literally the very minimal trash
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.560]   I created into Antarctica is gonna stay there
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.280]   until next December, and then it'll get taken to Cape Town.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.340]   Just that logistical idea alone blows my mind.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.040]   We live in a space and a place and in an age
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.980]   where we're like, these things are just like second nature,
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.240]   and we just think, oh yeah, we can recycle something
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.500]   or throw something away or get something delivered tomorrow.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.220]   And that's an incredible luxury.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   I had to go a very far distance
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.140]   and spend a lot of money and blah-da-dee-blah
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.920]   to realize how luxurious I have it at home.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.040]   - Wow.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.840]   I do have two questions that are probably pretty normal.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.800]   How cold and how bright?
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.460]   - So bright.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.120]   Oh my God, so bright.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.760]   So the disorienting thing for me was that,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.880]   obviously we're underneath the Antarctic Circle,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.200]   24 hours of daylight.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.520]   The sun does move.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.800]   It doesn't just stay right overhead
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.300]   like it does at the South Pole.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.280]   It moves around in sort of like a oval shape.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.860]   The vistas are so wide that it doesn't go down
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.120]   below any of the mountains,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.840]   'cause in most places you're 30 to 50 miles away
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.320]   from mountains that look like you could reach out
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.720]   and touch them, but they're super far away.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.320]   So the brightness is real, obviously from the sun,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.180]   but also from sun glare off of the snow.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.980]   So you have to wear specialized glasses
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.680]   that really wrap around any open area,
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.460]   including your nose, where sun could get in,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.680]   because otherwise it zaps your eyes.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.240]   So even like the moments of like,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.040]   I'd like briefly take off my glasses,
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.760]   I'd be like, whoa, like put them back on
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.920]   'cause it's intense.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.800]   Sunscreen as well.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.720]   Put sunscreen everywhere 'cause you will burn
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.040]   any single spot that is exposed.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.560]   Cold is an interesting thing.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.080]   Cold is relative to how much wind there is.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.680]   Standing on ice, obviously you're at about zero Celsius
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.640]   or a little below.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.800]   When the wind blows, you're at very cold very fast.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.000]   And they have these things called katabatic winds,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.080]   which is basically when the wind picks up
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.840]   in what would be the afternoon.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.560]   There is time, by the way, but there's no time zone.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.580]   It's very strange.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.440]   But anyway, in the afternoons, the winds would pick up.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.800]   They'd come from the South.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.440]   So blowing from the South North,
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.720]   from the South Pole up towards where we were,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.520]   it could get pretty windy pretty fast.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.120]   If so, you get these little shards of ice and snow
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.040]   that whip off of the glacier
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.200]   and they feel like exploiting treatments.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.280]   They're strong, but you know, with a good wind jacket on
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.600]   and like a face buffer, you're fine.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   So we were out skiing and up sailing
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.640]   and having fun in strong winds.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.040]   Wind chill wise, it could go down to negative 10,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.680]   negative 15 Celsius like that.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.880]   I never felt cold.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.260]   There were days where I felt hot,
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.200]   where we'd be hiking up and down a glacier or a hill
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.240]   and I'd like take off layers 'cause it's toasty.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.560]   - But because you were working.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.440]   - 'Cause we were working out, we were well-dressed.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.800]   You definitely take care of yourself in the surroundings.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.600]   There was one night where I walked from my pod
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.080]   where I slept to like the communal pod
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   where everyone was like having dinner and hanging out.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.400]   And I wore sandals as a joke.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.960]   And my toes got a little cold.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   (laughing)
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.800]   - And you said time zone,
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.600]   like is there a time zone in Antarctica?
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.440]   How does that work?
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.260]   - Yeah, so each scientific base that's down there
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.500]   chooses their own time
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.600]   based on where their sort of home country is.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.020]   So we were closest to an Indian base
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.000]   and they chose GMT, they chose London time.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.960]   We were on London time as well,
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.080]   but we were technically like one time zone over
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.840]   and South Africa was one time zone further from us.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.320]   There's a Russian base down there that chooses Russian time
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.420]   even though they're on the other side
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.980]   of the world from Russia.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.720]   There's obviously a lot of US bases
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.320]   and they choose New Zealand or US time.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.600]   So it just depends on where you're sort of aligned.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.400]   - But you could conceivably get in one of these planes,
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.560]   fly from one place to the other in the middle of the day,
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.880]   but when you get there, everyone's sleeping.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.700]   - Totally.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.520]   And that's the disorienting part
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.580]   is that like you wake up at two in the morning
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.760]   to have a glass of water and like it is bright out.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.280]   And I'm not saying bright, I mean like the sun is overhead.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.480]   - Wow.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.320]   Thanks for doing a little bonus here.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.160]   - Thank you.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160]   - On a place that most people don't get to go.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.720]   - Yeah, I hope more people will get to go.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.560]   It is truly magical and fascinating
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.140]   and well worth your investment.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.000]   Save your time, save your money and go.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.080]   - All right, thanks for being here.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.920]   - Thank you.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.240]   - I hope you liked this little bonus episode on Antarctica.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   I have mixed feelings because now I really wanna go,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.040]   but wow, is it really expensive.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.360]   So no idea how I'm gonna make that happen,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.880]   but it still remains on my bucket list.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.040]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.880]   See you next week.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.240]   (whooshing)
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
