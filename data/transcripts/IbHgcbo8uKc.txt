[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   - What is real?
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.080]   Let's start with an easy question.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.800]   Put another way, how do we know what is real
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.320]   and what is merely a creation
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.860]   of our human perception and imagination?
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.300]   - We don't know.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.140]   We don't know.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.960]   This is science.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.580]   I presume we're talking about science.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.920]   And we believe, or I believe,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.160]   that there is a world that is independent of my existence
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   and my experience about it and my knowledge of it.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.460]   And this I call the real world.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.760]   - So you said science, but even bigger than science.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   - Sure, sure.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.020]   I need not have said this is science.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.980]   I just was warming up.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.120]   - Warming up.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.440]   Okay, now that we're warmed up,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680]   let's take a brief step outside of science.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.040]   Is it completely a crazy idea to you
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   that everything that exists
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.440]   is merely a creation of our mind?
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.520]   So there's a few, not many,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.840]   this is outside of science now,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.760]   people who believe perception is fundamentally
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.620]   what's in our human perception,
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.240]   the visual cortex and so on,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.880]   the cognitive constructs that's being formed there
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320]   is the reality, and that anything outside
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.120]   is something that we can never really grasp.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.720]   Is that a crazy idea to you?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.400]   - There's a version of that that is not crazy at all.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.000]   What we experience is constructed by our brains
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.840]   and by our brains in an active mode.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.560]   So we don't see the raw world,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.460]   we see a very processed world.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.120]   We feel something that's very processed through our brains,
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760]   and our brains are incredible.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   But I still believe that behind that experience,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.040]   that mirror, veil, or whatever you wanna call it,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.160]   there is a real world, and I'm curious about it.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360]   - Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.260]   Is it through the tools of physics,
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.040]   from theory to the experiments?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.960]   Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   that's more connected to our ape ancestors?
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.640]   that really allow us to grasp it?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.680]   - Well, let's talk about what tools they are,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   what you say are the tools of math and physics.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.120]   I mean, I think we're in the same position
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.520]   as our ancestors in the caves,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.800]   or before the caves, or whatever.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.960]   We find ourselves in this world, and we're curious.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.560]   We also, it's important to be able to explain
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   what happens when there are fires,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.800]   when there are not fires, what animals and plants
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.660]   are good to eat, and all that stuff.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.320]   But we're also just curious.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   We look up in the sky, and we see the sun,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.640]   and the moon, and the stars, and we see some of those move,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.840]   and we're very curious about that.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.480]   I think we're just naturally curious.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   So, we make, this is my version of how we work.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   We make up stories and explanations.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.640]   And there are two things which I think
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.200]   are just true of being human.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.680]   We make judgments fast, because we have to.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   We're, to survive, is that a tiger, or is that not a tiger?
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.060]   And we go. - Act.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.800]   - We have to act fast on incomplete information.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.680]   So, we judge quickly, and we're often wrong,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.800]   or at least sometimes wrong, which is all I need for this.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.200]   We're often wrong.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   So, we fool ourselves, and we fool other people, readily.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.560]   And so, there's lots of stories that get told,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.960]   and some of them result in a concrete benefit,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.240]   and some of them don't.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.040]   - So, you said we're often wrong,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.100]   but what does it mean to be right?
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.620]   - Right, that's an excellent question.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.020]   To be right, well, since I believe
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.640]   that there is a real world, I believe that to be,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.160]   you can challenge me on this if you're not a realist.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.640]   A realist is somebody who believes
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.900]   in this real, objective world,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.700]   which is independent of our perception.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.300]   If I'm a realist, I think that to be right
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.860]   is to come closer.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860]   I think, first of all, there's a relative scale.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.140]   There's not right and wrong.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.600]   There's right or more right and less right.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.740]   And you're more right if you come closer
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.700]   to an exact, true description of that real world.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.460]   Now, can we know that for sure?
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.700]   No.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.540]   - And the scientific method is ultimately
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.300]   what allows us to get a sense
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.660]   of how close we're getting to that real world?
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.780]   - No on two counts.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.620]   First of all, I don't believe there's a scientific method.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.340]   I was very influenced when I was in graduate school
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.460]   by the writings of Paul Feyerabend,
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.380]   who was an important philosopher of science,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.980]   who argued that there isn't a scientific method.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.820]   - There is or there isn't?
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.660]   - There is not.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.620]   - There's not.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.460]   Can you elaborate?
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.460]   I'm sorry if you were going to,
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.000]   but can you elaborate on the,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.460]   what does it mean for there not to be a scientific method,
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.200]   this notion that I think a lot of people believe in?
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   In this day and age?
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.720]   - Sure.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.400]   Paul Feyerabend, he was a student of Popper,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.960]   who taught Karl Popper.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.520]   And Feyerabend argued,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.600]   both by logic and by historical example,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.360]   that you name anything that should be part of
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.680]   the practice of science,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.100]   say you should always make sure that your theories agree
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.840]   with all the data that's already been taken.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.260]   And he'll prove to you that there have to be times
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.040]   when science contradicts,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   when some scientist contradicts that advice
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.660]   for science to progress overall.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.920]   So it's not a simple matter.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.460]   I think that,
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.880]   I think of science as a community.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.840]   - Of people.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.800]   - Of people, and as a community of people
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.760]   bound by certain ethical precepts,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.560]   percepts, whatever that is.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.160]   - So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.040]   meaning ethically, of kind of the rules of the game
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.120]   they operate under.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.660]   - Don't lie, report all your results,
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.680]   Check, the training of a scientist
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.960]   mostly consists of methods of checking,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.100]   because again, we make lots of mistakes,
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.320]   we're very error prone,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.280]   but there are tools both on the mathematics side
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.140]   and the experimental side to check
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.640]   and double check and triple check.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.040]   And a scientist goes through a training,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   and I think this is part of it.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.840]   You can't just walk off the street and say,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.280]   "Yo, I'm a scientist."
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   You have to go through the training,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   and the training, the test that lets you be done
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.200]   with the training is can you form a convincing case
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.440]   for something that your colleagues
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.200]   will not be able to shout down,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.080]   because they'll ask, "Did you check this,
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.780]   "and did you check that, and did you check this,
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.320]   "and what about a seeming contradiction with this?"
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.880]   And you've gotta have answers to all those things
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.440]   or you don't get taken seriously.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.180]   And when you get to the point where you can produce
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.580]   that kind of defense and argument,
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.120]   then they give you a PhD.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.520]   And you're kind of licensed.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.620]   You're still gonna be questioned,
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.280]   and you still may propose or publish mistakes,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   but the community is gonna have to waste less time
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.480]   fixing your mistakes.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.880]   - Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   what's the gap between the thing that that community does
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.280]   and the ideal of the scientific method?
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.480]   The scientific method is you should be able
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   to repeat an experiment.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.080]   There's a lot of elements to what construes
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.620]   the scientific method, but the final result,
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.360]   the hope of it is that you should be able to say
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.800]   with some confidence that a particular thing
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.660]   is close to the truth.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.080]   - Right, but there's not a simple relationship
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.220]   between experiment and hypothesis or theory.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.720]   For example, Galileo did this experiment
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.080]   of dropping a ball from the top of a tower,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.500]   and it falls right at the base of the tower.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.120]   And Aristotelian would say, "Wow, of course it falls
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.340]   "right to the base of the tower.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.000]   "That shows that the Earth isn't moving
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.400]   "while the ball is falling."
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.440]   And Galileo says no weight is a principle of inertia
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.960]   and it has an inertia in a direction
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.040]   with the Earth isn't moving and the tower
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.500]   and the ball and the Earth all move together.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.760]   When the principle of inertia tells you it hits the bottom,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.680]   it does look, therefore my principle of inertia is right.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.960]   And Aristotelian says no, Aristotle's science is right,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.080]   the Earth is stationary.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   And so you've got to get an interconnected bunch of cases
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.840]   and work hard to line up and explain.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.520]   It took centuries to make the transition
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.560]   from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   It wasn't done till Newton in 1680-something, 1687.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.640]   - So what do you think is the nature of the process
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   that seems to lead to progress?
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.800]   If we at least look at the long arc of science
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.060]   of all the community of scientists,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.640]   they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.800]   that engineers can then take on and build rockets with
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   or build computers with or build cool stuff with.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.280]   - I don't know, a better job than what?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.160]   - Than this previous century.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.480]   So century by century, we'll talk about string theory
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.680]   and so on and kind of possible,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   what you might think of as dead ends and so on.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.280]   - Which is not the way I think of string theory.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   We'll straighten it out.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.520]   We'll get on string straight.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.560]   But there is, nevertheless, in science,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.680]   very often at least temporary dead ends.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   But if you look through centuries,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   the century before Newton and the century after Newton,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.920]   that then could be usable by our civilization
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.560]   to build the iPhone, right?
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.540]   To build cool things that improve our quality of life.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.100]   That's the progress I'm kind of referring to.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.080]   - Let me, can I say that more precisely?
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.920]   - Yes.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.760]   (laughing)
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.580]   It's a low bar.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.320]   - 'Cause I think it's important to get the time places right.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.460]   - Yes.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.280]   - There was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.160]   between about 1900 or late 1890s
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   and into the 1930s, 1940s,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.480]   and maybe some, if you stretched it, into the 1970s.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.160]   And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.760]   and that included a lot of developments
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.960]   of electromagnetism.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.240]   The confirmation, which wasn't really well confirmed
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.200]   into the 20th century, that matter was made of atoms.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   And the whole picture of nuclei
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.480]   with electrons going around,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.160]   and this is early 20th century.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   And then quantum mechanics was from 1905,
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.800]   took a long time to develop,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   to the late 1920s, and then it was basically in final form.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.080]   And the basis of this partial revolution,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   and we can come back to why it's only a partial revolution,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.680]   is the basis of the technologies you mentioned.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.480]   All of, I mean, electrical technology
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.520]   was being developed slowly with this,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.640]   and in fact, there's a close relation
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.200]   between the development of electricity
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.760]   and the electrification of cities in the United States
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.240]   and Europe and so forth,
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.940]   and the development of the science.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.900]   The fundamental physics,
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.180]   since the early 1970s,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.860]   doesn't have a story like that so far.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.860]   There's not a series of triumphs and progresses,
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.400]   and there's not any practical application.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.700]   - So, just to linger briefly on the early 20th century
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.740]   and the revolutions in science that happened there,
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.620]   what was the method by which the scientific community
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.580]   kept each other in check about
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.780]   when you get something right, when you get something wrong?
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.260]   Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.980]   - It's absolutely necessary,
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.280]   and the key things were all validated,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.580]   the key predictions of quantum mechanics
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.920]   and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.580]   - So, before we talk about Einstein,
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.860]   your new book before string theory, quantum mechanics,
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.700]   so on, let's take a step back at a higher level question.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.020]   What is, that you mentioned, what is realism?
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.260]   What is anti-realism?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.500]   And maybe why do you find realism,
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.340]   as you mentioned, so compelling?
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.820]   - Realism is the belief in an external world
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.340]   independent of our existence, our perception,
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.380]   our belief, our knowledge.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.180]   A realist, as a physicist, is somebody who believes
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.980]   that there should be possible
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.880]   some completely objective description
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.480]   of each and every process at the fundamental level,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.680]   which describes and explains exactly what happens
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.460]   and why it happens.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.340]   - That kind of implies that that system,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.980]   in a realist view, is deterministic,
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.780]   meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.980]   that you can never get to the bottom of.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.940]   You can get to the bottom of anything
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.900]   and perfectly describe it.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.380]   - Some people would say that I'm not that interested
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.380]   in determinism, but I could live with the fundamental world,
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.220]   which had some chance in it.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.420]   - So do you, you said you could live with it,
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.180]   but do you think God plays dice in our universe?
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.420]   - I think it's probably much worse than that.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.740]   - In which direction?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.580]   - I think that theories can change
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.780]   and theories can change without warning.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.180]   I think the future is open.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.540]   - You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.380]   - Yeah.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.540]   - Okay, we'll get there.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:48.340]   I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.380]   but apparently--
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.220]   - Well, the ground is pretty solid.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.800]   - The entirety of it, temporarily so.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.580]   Okay, so realism is the idea that
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.540]   while the ground is solid, you can describe it.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.300]   What's the role of the human being,
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.300]   our beautiful, complex human mind in realism?
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.420]   Do we have a, are we just another set of molecules
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.100]   connected together in a clever way,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.100]   or does the observer, our human mind,
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.400]   consciousness have a role in this realism view
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.020]   of the physical universe?
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.100]   - There's two ways, there's two questions
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.100]   you could be asking.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.380]   Does our conscious mind, do our perceptions
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.540]   play a role in making things become,
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.000]   in making things real or things becoming?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.020]   That's question one.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.100]   Question two is, does this, we can call it
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.620]   a naturalist view of the world
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.760]   that is based on realism, allow a place
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.480]   to understand the existence of and the nature
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   of perceptions and consciousness in mind?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.940]   And that's question two.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.320]   Question two, I do think a lot about,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.840]   and my answer, which is not an answer, is I hope so,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.380]   but it certainly doesn't yet.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.840]   - So what kind-- - Question one,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.720]   I don't think so.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.400]   But of course, the answer to question one
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.840]   depends on question two.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   - Right.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.700]   So I'm not up to question one, yeah.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.380]   - So question two is the thing that you can
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.140]   kind of struggle with at this time.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.740]   What about the anti-realists?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.900]   So what flavor, what are the different camps
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.080]   of anti-realists that you've talked about?
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.620]   I think it would be nice if you could articulate
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.780]   for the people for whom there is not
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.140]   a very concrete real world, or there's divisions,
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.920]   or it's messier than the realist view of the universe.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.320]   What are the different camps, what are the different views?
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.000]   - I'm not sure I'm a good scholar
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.640]   and can talk about the different camps and analyze it,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.240]   but many of the inventors of quantum physics
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.480]   were not realists, were anti-realists.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.680]   And there are scholars, they lived in a very perilous time
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.480]   between the two world wars.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.180]   And there were a lot of trends in culture
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.940]   which were going that way.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.540]   But in any case, they said things like
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:26.060]   the purpose of science is not to give an objective
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.420]   realist description of nature as it would be in our absence.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.740]   This might be saying Niels Bohr.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.020]   The purpose of science is as an extension
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.460]   of our conversations with each other
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.000]   to describe our interactions with nature.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.020]   And we're free to invent and use terms like particle,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.340]   or wave, or causality, or time, or space
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.620]   if they're useful to us and they carry
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.140]   some intuitive implication.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.020]   But we shouldn't believe that they actually have to do
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.180]   with what nature would be like in our absence,
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.100]   which we have nothing to say about.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.780]   - Do you find any aspect of that,
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.140]   'cause you kind of said that we human beings tell stories.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.620]   Do you find aspects of that kind of anti-realist view
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.460]   of Niels Bohr compelling?
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.620]   That we're fundamentally our storytellers
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.620]   and then we create tools of space and time and causality
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.200]   and whatever this fun quantum mechanics stuff is
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.440]   to help us tell the story of our world.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.220]   - Sure, I just would like to believe that there's
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.140]   an aspiration for the other thing.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.060]   - The other thing being what?
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.660]   - The realist point of view.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.980]   - Do you hope that the stories will eventually lead us
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   to discovering the real world as it is?
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:56.180]   - Yeah.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.820]   - Is perfection possible, by the way?
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.660]   - No.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.540]   You mean will we ever get there and know that we're there?
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.440]   - That's for people 5,000 years in the future.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.380]   We're certainly nowhere near there yet.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.860]   - Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:23.300]   do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.460]   as again descendants of apes,
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.440]   who are just biological systems?
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.420]   Is there a limit to our mind's capability
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.380]   to actually understand reality?
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:39.020]   There comes a point, even with the help
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.680]   of the tools of physics, that we just cannot grasp
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.460]   some fundamental aspects of that reality.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.840]   - Again, I think that's a question
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.460]   for 5,000 years in the future.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.780]   - We're not even close to that limit.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.700]   - I think there is a universality.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.520]   Here, I don't agree with David Deutsch about everything,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.880]   but I admire the way he put things in his last book.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.180]   And he talked about the role of explanation.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.460]   And he talked about the universality of certain languages,
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.660]   or the universality of mathematics,
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.380]   or of computing, and so forth.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.060]   And he believed that universality,
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.880]   which is something real, which is somehow comes out
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.620]   of the fact that a symbolic system,
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.220]   or a mathematical system, can refer to itself,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.780]   and can, I forget what that's called,
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.520]   can reference back to itself.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.660]   And build, in which he argued for a universality
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.140]   of possibility for our understanding,
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.020]   whatever is out there.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.940]   But I admire that argument.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.940]   But it seems to me we're doing okay so far,
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.500]   but we'll have to see.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.820]   - Whether there is a limit or not.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.900]   For now, we've got plenty to play with.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.740]   - Yeah.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.900]   (audience cheering)
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   (audience cheering)
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   (audience cheering)
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.900]   (audience cheering)
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:21.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
