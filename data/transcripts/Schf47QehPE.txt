[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.300]   Well, every area of life calls for evaluation.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.640]   Should we be doing one thing or something else?
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.700]   Career A or Career B?
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.780]   Enough school or more school?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.020]   Stop spending, start investing.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.060]   Don't settle for the good when you can go for the great.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.660]   All sorts of books and workshops and apps stand ready
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.460]   to help us live from higher priorities.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.140]   And this is important, especially for Christians,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.460]   because we live for the highest priority that there is.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.140]   We live for the eternal.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.060]   Our everlasting priority bears on our media diets,
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.980]   our gaming, our careers, our parenting,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.940]   really every single decision that we make in life.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.660]   In the summer of 1997, Pastor John preached a sermon
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.660]   on Hebrews 11:39-12.2, a section of scripture
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.100]   popularly referred to as God's Hall of Fame
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940]   or the Hall of Faith, a section celebrating our ancestors
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420]   in the faith who learned to live faithfully in this life,
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.300]   turning away from the good in order to pursue
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220]   the eternally great.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.780]   Here's a clip from that sermon sent to us
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800]   from a listener named Melissa in Lumberton, New Jersey.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.380]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.380]   - And life has begun to be trivial, light, L-I-T-E,
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.420]   blood light, life light, church light.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.720]   - That's who he's writing to.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.380]   Chapter five, verse 12.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   Though by this time you ought to be teachers,
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.700]   you have need again for someone to teach you
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.900]   the elemental principles of the oracles of God.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.900]   You come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.140]   You hear the ache in this writer's voice?
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740]   There's been enough time since you got saved
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.660]   that you should be teaching a class.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.460]   Or a small group, or a wife, or children, or a neighbor.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.580]   You should be teaching.
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.940]   And you need milk still all these many years later.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.780]   Why?
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.420]   You're drifting, you're coasting, you're neglecting,
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.640]   you're not vigilant.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.260]   You're treating life as though you can just get up
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.740]   in the morning and meander instead of run.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.640]   That's who he's writing to.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420]   Chapter 12, verse 12.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.440]   Strengthen the hands that are weak
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.500]   and the knees that are feeble.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.360]   Make straight paths for your feet
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.920]   but rather be healed.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.700]   In other words, there's still time,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.120]   there's hope for this church.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   This is a metaphor of their spiritual condition.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   Hands are kind of weak.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.280]   They're on the bat like this at the home plate.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.160]   You don't stand like that at the home plate.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   You stand like this.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   The knees are weak, just kind of wobbling around.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.480]   And you know what happens with weak knees?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.640]   They get hit from the side and it's over.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   History, big surgery, big brace, and no more basketball.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.280]   So while there's still time, do some exercises
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.960]   to get the cartilage and to get the muscles up to speed.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.320]   This is all spiritual talk here.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.180]   He doesn't give a rip about your knees, I don't think.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.020]   Well, a little bit.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.100]   The Bible says he gives a little bit of a rip,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.160]   but not much.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   He'd rather have your legs cut off and go to heaven
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.940]   than to keep legs and go to hell.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.860]   So have you got the picture now of this church
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.580]   that he's writing to in chapter 12?
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.160]   Let's read verse one at the end again,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   'cause here's the main point.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.920]   Chapter 12, verse one, near the end of the verse.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   Let us lay aside every encumbrance and sin
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.960]   which so easily entangles us,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.320]   and let us run with endurance the race
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.280]   that is set before us.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.300]   Now this command, let's run, let's run, let's run,
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.480]   does not come out of the blue.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.280]   It comes out of a passion for this church
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.240]   that's in tremendous spiritual danger
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.840]   because of a false concept of life as meandering
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   and coasting and drifting, no vigilance, no care,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040]   no watching, no earnestness, no weightiness.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.640]   And he says, "This is very dangerous.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   And so please let us look to Christ and let us run."
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.940]   So the main point of this whole text that I read
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.700]   from verse 39 of chapter 11 to verse two of chapter 12
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.220]   has one imperative, even though in English there's several,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.320]   in Greek there's one imperative and it's run.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.880]   Let us run.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.380]   Everything else in this text explains running
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.780]   or motivates running.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   So the point is don't stroll, don't meander,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   and don't wonder about aimlessly run
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.200]   as in a race with a finish line
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.240]   where everything hangs on the race.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.480]   Now, what supports it?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.120]   In verse one, there are a couple of things said here
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.860]   as a means to running.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   It says, "Lay aside every encumbrance and sin
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.820]   which so easily entangles us."
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.880]   Now, I remember as a boy the effect a sermon had on me
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.420]   on this verse.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.860]   And the only thing I remember was the distinction
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.100]   that the preacher made between,
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.980]   he was preaching from the King James at the time,
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.980]   weights translated encumbrances here and sins.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.820]   And he looked out on us and he said, "Not just sins.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.500]   Don't just lay aside sins to run this race.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.140]   Lay aside every other weight that gets in your way."
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.820]   As a boy, you know what the effect,
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.940]   it was a revolutionary effect that that had on me
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.740]   because what it said to me was,
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.180]   and I speak it now, especially for young people,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.700]   kids, if you can get this,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.520]   but especially young teenagers and teenagers,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.140]   but it applies to everybody.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.940]   What this says is,
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.980]   don't just ask, "What's wrong with it?"
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.740]   In life.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   Don't just say about your music, about your movies,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.180]   about your parties, about your habits,
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.260]   about your computer games.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.580]   Don't just say, "What's wrong with it?"
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.260]   Don't just ask, "Is it a sin?"
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.100]   That's about the lowest question you can ask in life.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.580]   I'm gonna do it if it's not a sin.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.460]   So tell me, is it a sin to do this?
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.500]   Well, not exactly.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.700]   Okay, that's all I wanna know.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.900]   I'm gonna have to do it.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.380]   And the preacher said, and I'm the preacher now,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.060]   saying, "This text says,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:52.180]   "look to Jesus and lay aside sins for sure
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.340]   "and lots of other stuff too."
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.420]   Now that's a different way to live.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.500]   So what, well, preacher, what question
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.660]   as a 13-year-old, 14-year-old,
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.740]   should I ask if it's not, is it a sin?
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.140]   And the answer is, does it help me run?
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.700]   That's the answer.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.020]   Does it get in my way when I'm trying to become
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.100]   more patient, more kind, more gentle,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.740]   more loving, more holy, more pure, more self-controlled?
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740]   Does it get in my way or does it help me run?
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.860]   That's the question to ask.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.780]   Ask the maximal righteousness question,
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.260]   not the minimal righteousness question.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.420]   That was the difference it made in my life.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.100]   And I've been ever since then,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.380]   I didn't always live up to this.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.340]   I'm not making any claim that from age 12 on,
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.380]   I did some great spiritual thing,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.180]   but oh, I had a trajectory that was so much better
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.940]   than the minimalist ethic that comes with,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.300]   well, what's wrong with it?
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.060]   What's wrong with it?
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.900]   What?
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.700]   I don't even wanna talk about what's wrong with it.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.100]   Let's talk about, does it help me run?
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.780]   Now, you know why that question isn't very often asked?
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.020]   Because we're not passionate runners.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.340]   We don't wanna run.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.260]   We don't get up in the morning saying,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.700]   what's the course today?
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.180]   What's the course of purity?
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.660]   What's the course of holiness?
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.180]   What's the course of humility?
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.660]   What's the course of justice?
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.220]   What's the course of righteousness?
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.500]   What's the course of love?
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.380]   What's the course of self-control?
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.580]   What's the course of courage and witness?
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.540]   Oh God, I wanna maximize my running today.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.340]   If you have that mentality about your life,
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.860]   then you'll ask not how many sins can I avoid,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.340]   but how many weights can I lay down
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.340]   so that I am fleet-footed in the race of righteousness.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.580]   - Powerful.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.180]   Thank you, Melissa in Lumberton, New Jersey for the clip.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.420]   This was the first John Piper sermon I ever heard.
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.140]   She writes, "It was five years ago.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.860]   "My husband and I had both been going through
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.960]   "spiritual dry spells, trying to navigate life
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.820]   "with our very young family without God-centered direction.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.980]   "I became spiritually lazy and got lost
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.300]   "in the rut of day-to-day life.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.520]   "My husband felt God pulling at him
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   "to bring more discipleship into our home.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.160]   "So one night, instead of turning on the TV,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.720]   "he went to Desiring God and played this sermon.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.380]   "Within 15 minutes, I was in tears.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.480]   "God used Pastor John's words like a lightning bolt
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.280]   "to electrify me and resuscitate my heart.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.800]   "While we obviously are not perfect,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.700]   "a new sense of purpose and calling
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.820]   "drives our lives every day towards Jesus,
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.120]   "towards Christ-likeness and towards his purposes.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.560]   "For the rest of my life, I will hear echoing in my ears
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.060]   "Pastor John's clarion call, 'Does it help me run?'"
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.940]   That's a powerful testimony.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.400]   The clip is from John Piper's sermon
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.760]   titled "Running with the Witnesses"
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   preached on August 17th, 1997.

[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.680]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email

[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.400]   Well, 1 Peter 3:7 calls wives the weaker vessels
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.920]   in the marriage relationship,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.520]   but what exactly does that mean?
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.240]   Are we talking about physically weaker,
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.160]   emotionally weaker, spiritually weaker,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.800]   or something altogether different?
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.720]   That's next time.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhke.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.580]   We'll see you back here on Friday with Pastor John
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.540]   back in the studio.
