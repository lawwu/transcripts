[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So I just spent a day at a company called Neuralink
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   and what they do is try to design
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.700]   what's called the brain machine, brain computer interface.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.420]   So they try to do thousands readings in the brain,
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.720]   be able to read what the neurons are firing
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.660]   and then stimulate back, so two way.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.900]   Do you think their dream is to expand the capacity
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.780]   of the brain to attain information?
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.340]   Sort of increase the bandwidth
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.620]   at which we can search Google kind of thing.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.420]   Do you think our cognitive capacity might be expanded,
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.520]   our linguistic capacity, our ability to reason
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.340]   might be expanded by adding a machine into the picture?
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.780]   - Can be expanded in a certain sense,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.020]   but a sense that was known thousands of years ago.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.860]   A book expands your cognitive capacity.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.220]   Okay, so this could expand it too.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.100]   - But it's not a fundamental expansion.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.140]   It's not totally new things could be understood.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.220]   - Well, nothing that goes beyond
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.660]   their native cognitive capacities.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.820]   Just like you can't turn the visual system
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820]   into an insect system.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.820]   - Well, I mean the thought is perhaps
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.580]   you can't directly, but you can map.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.560]   - You could, but we know that without this experiment.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   You could map what a bee sees and present it in a form
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.120]   so that we could follow it.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120]   In fact, every bee scientist does that.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.560]   - But you don't think there's something greater than bees
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.840]   that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.960]   be able to understand a quantum world, quantum mechanics,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.160]   be able to start to be able to make sense.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.660]   - Students at MIT study and understand quantum mechanics.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.280]   But they always reduce it to the infant, the physical.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.080]   I mean, they don't really understand.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.400]   - Oh, you don't, there's things.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.520]   That may be another area where there's just a limit
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.880]   to understanding.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   We understand the theories, but the world that it describes
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.600]   doesn't make any sense.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.640]   So, you know, the experiment, Schrödinger's cat,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   for example, can understand the theory,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.920]   but as Schrödinger pointed out,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.680]   it's an unintelligible world.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.400]   One of the reasons why Einstein was always very skeptical
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   about quantum theory, he described himself
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   as a classical realist, in one's intelligibility.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.140]   - He has something in common with infants in that way.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.380]   (chuckles)
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
