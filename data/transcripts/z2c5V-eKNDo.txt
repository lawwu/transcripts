[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I love this quote that you're not at the end of history, which it really makes a
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.720]   lot of sense once you're told, but it's not intuitive, I guess, from human nature.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.960]   So any of us, if we look at what we wanted 10 years ago and what we wanted 20 years
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.000]   ago, what our priorities were, what our values were, it's very easy to identify
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.640]   ways that you have become more mature, that you've just changed your thinking
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.960]   on things, but it is much harder to recognize that you are very likely to
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   continue to evolve in what your preferences are and what your priorities
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.120]   are going forward. But I think just this humility to recognize that you are
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.440]   likely to continue to change. And I think one of the things there is you can't know
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.880]   exactly how you'll change, but if you look at people who are further along in
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.280]   the journey, you certainly see common patterns on how people tend to evolve,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.160]   and so try to learn from those.
