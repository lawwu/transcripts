[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.600]   to the Romans in chapter 11, verses 11 and 12. Verses 11 and 12 in the 11th chapter of
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.920]   Paul's epistle to the Romans. I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.160]   God forbid! But rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   for to provoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.440]   and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness?
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.000]   Now we've dealt, as most of you will recall, with the exact detailed explanation of the terms that
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   are to be found in these two most important and vital verses. Here we have two of those verses
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.880]   which are quite essential to any attempt at an understanding of the remainder of the teaching
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.480]   of this chapter, which is such an important chapter as we've already seen in the whole
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.600]   outlook and future, not only for Gentile believers in Christ, but particularly for
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.160]   the nation of Israel regarded as a whole. That's the subject of the whole chapter.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.960]   And these two verses, as I've been indicating, are really quite crucial in that respect. Now
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.480]   the problem the Apostle takes up is this. Why is it that God has allowed the bulk of the nation
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.080]   of Israel to reject the gospel? Why is it that they are outside the church? And we've seen that
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.440]   there are three answers to that question which are given in these two verses. The first is that
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.800]   this was God's way in his own inscrutable wisdom of sending the gospel to the Gentiles. That's
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   the first reason. But then secondly, that works in a most odd way. The sending of the gospel to
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.280]   the Gentiles and the believing of the gospel by the Gentiles has stirred up the Jews to envy or
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.160]   to emulation, so that indirectly God is still dealing with them and going to bring them back
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.480]   in this way. And then thirdly, and this is the particular message of verse 12, the Apostle goes
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:31.000]   on to show that if the present condition of Israel has turned out to be a blessing to the Gentiles,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   how much more will their restoration be a blessing to the Gentiles? Now those are the three reasons,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.240]   and we've considered these terms in detail, pointing out last week in particular how there
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   has been a great deal of discussion about the meaning of these certain words diminishing
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.640]   particularly and fullness. But we've dealt with all that, and I ended last week by saying that
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.120]   having then got clear in our minds the actual statement which the Apostle is making, we are
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.760]   now in a position to go on to consider certain general lessons, certain general doctrines,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.440]   if you like, which can be garnered from this all-important statement. Now let's be clear about
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   this. The Apostle here is writing as a prophet. He's saying that this is going to happen. He's
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   not merely saying that it's a possibility. He is saying this is going to happen. Their fullness
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.200]   is going to be a fact. Even as they are, and in the light of what has happened, this has turned
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.880]   to be a great source of richness to the Gentiles, and a great source of enriching. But, says the
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:59.280]   Apostle, it's nothing in comparison with what will take place when the Jews really come back
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.040]   and see the Gospel and believe it and are restored and become members of the Christian Church,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.440]   and thus the great promises of God to Israel receive their ultimate fulfillment. Very well.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.920]   Now, these two verses I want to try to show you tonight constitute what I would call a great
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   seminal statement. In other words, they contain within them seeds, seeds of thoughts, seeds of
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.800]   doctrine, doctrine which is of great importance to us not only in our understanding of God's
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.160]   purposes with regard to the Jews, not only with regard to our general understanding of
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   the Scriptures, but also of great and inestimable value to us in our own personal experiences,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:00.000]   and as we come to consider the ways of God with respect to mankind. So, I've tried to group these
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.640]   lessons, teachings, doctrines, under certain headings. The first and the obvious one is this.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:17.440]   The teaching which we have here with regard to the Jews as a nation. That's obviously the first
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.960]   thing, and it's here on the very surface. Now, what are the lessons, what are the things which
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.560]   are taught us here with regard to the relationship of the Jews as a nation to God? And the first
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.000]   lesson under this heading, I suggest, is the following. One cannot but immediately be impressed
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.440]   by the miracle of biblical prophecy. This is one of these general points, you see. What I mean is
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   this, that the condition of the Jews and their rejection of the gospel, as we've seen in the
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   multiplicity of quotations that the Apostle gives us, is all something that had been prophesied
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.120]   and predicted. Now, this whole question of prophecy is a vital one. I'm not staying with
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.760]   it tonight. I've often referred to it like this in passing. But there is no greater proof of the
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.480]   truth of the Christian message than this whole question of prophecy. It's also a proof of the
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.360]   inspiration of the scriptures. You remember how Peter puts that so well in his second epistle,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   and in that first chapter, where having given his own experience and testimony, having given his
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   report of what he and James and John had seen in the Mount of Transfiguration, he goes on to say,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.800]   "We have also a more sure word of prophecy, a word of prophecy made more sure. Whereunto we do well
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.240]   star ariseth in your hearts." And then he goes on to say, remember this, that no prophecy of the
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   scripture is of any private interpretation. The prophets were teachers, but they were not merely
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   teachers, neither were they mere seers, not merely exceptional men who had an insight. More than that,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.960]   no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.640]   old time by the will of men, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.920]   miracle of biblical prophecy. These things have all been anticipated, prophesied, God has revealed
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:31.360]   them, and the records were there eight centuries at least before these things came to pass, and in
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   some instances even more than that. But also, we can look at it in another way. Prophecy also foresees
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.640]   the future of the Jews, and that's what I say the apostle is doing here. He's writing as a prophet,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:55.840]   "The fullness of Israel is going to come in." Now remember, the apostle wrote this 1,900 years ago,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.360]   roughly speaking. 1,900 years ago. He put all this down. The situation seemed so utterly hopeless then,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:10.120]   you would have thought that Israel was finished. But the apostle, given the revelation, moved by
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:18.280]   the Holy Spirit, he utters this great prophecy, "The fullness of the nation of Israel is going to
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.520]   come in. They are going to be restored." Now prophecy is therefore a very wonderful thing.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.760]   It is a miracle of course. It's something that can't be explained in any terms except the
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.480]   supernatural action of God, both in revealing the truth and in guiding by inspiration those to whom
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   he has given the revelation to put it on record. So we must never forget this as we are reading
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.640]   the scriptures. Whatever people may say today, and this is the sort of thing they are saying,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.960]   they're trying to reduce this book to the level of any ordinary human writing, it doesn't.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:01.240]   Prophecy is a standing protest against death. And it prophesies facts. This is something that
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   you simply cannot explain except by means of the supernaturalism, which is of course basic in the
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.240]   whole of the biblical teaching. Very well, there's our first point in connection with this general
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.160]   subject of the Jews in their relationship to God. But come, let us make a second point under this
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:28.400]   heading. And that is that we are given here in these two verses an explanation, the only
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:38.840]   explanation of the miracle of the preservation of the Jews as a distinct nation. Now, this is of
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.040]   course one of the great standing miracles. When you consider the history of the Jews as a nation,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.800]   nothing is more remarkable than their persistence. Many nations have done their utmost to destroy
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.360]   them and to exterminate them. They've been regarded as the outcasts of society throughout
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.560]   the centuries. For many centuries. We can always take credit in this country that this was one of
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.640]   the first countries to reverse what had been the traditional treatment of the Jews. And some of us
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.520]   would take still more joy in the fact that it was that great man Oliver Cromwell who was the leader
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:22.040]   in that respect. Well, but the thing I'm emphasizing now is the miracle of the preservation and the
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.720]   persistence of the Jews as a nation. They were without their country for so many centuries,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:34.480]   and as I say, all nations did their utmost to destroy them completely. But in spite of all
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.840]   the efforts and the malignity of men, this nation has been preserved, and its identity has been
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.440]   preserved. And here, I say, is the only real explanation of it. God hasn't finished with them.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:55.080]   God hasn't finished with them. God has a purpose yet. And there is a day coming when this fullness
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:01.600]   of Israel is going to be brought back to salvation, back into the Christian Church. And so God's
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.320]   ultimate promise to Abram is going to receive this wonderful fulfillment. And therefore,
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.560]   there can be no question but that the reason for their preservation is that this thing might be
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.680]   established. If they'd lost their identity and appearance, and in other respects, well,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.440]   we would never have been so certain that God's promise had been fulfilled. But God has preserved
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:32.760]   them in this unique manner in order to be able to show in the realm of history that these promises
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:40.320]   are sure, and that as he has promised, he is not only able to perform, but he also will surely
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.280]   perform. Now, all that is implicit here. You see, Paul says without any hesitation, "It's alright,"
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.680]   he says, "their falling and their diminishing has turned out to be riches to us, but you wait until
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:59.880]   they come in in their fullness, then." Well, words will almost be inadequate to describe the blessings
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.800]   which we shall all receive. But here it is. It contains within it, therefore, the explanation
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:13.120]   of this extraordinary miracle of the preservation of the Jews. But then thirdly, under this same
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:22.200]   heading, we are taught here as to what our attitude should be towards the Jews, individually
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:29.320]   and as a nation. Now, this is what I meant at the very end, last Friday night, when I suggested I
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.920]   might give you a kind of homework to do, to show you the relevance of all this, which I'd hoped I
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.680]   would have dealt with last Friday, in terms of this Second Vatican Council that has just come
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.400]   to an end in Rome. There's been a great deal of talk there, but one concrete result that has come
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:55.000]   out of it is this, that they have reversed, decided to reverse, what has been their traditional
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.600]   attitude through the centuries, towards the Jews as a nation, with respect to their guilt in the
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.760]   matter of the crucifixion of our Lord. They have now decided to exonerate the Jews from that
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:18.320]   particular guilt. Now, that, of course, was the thing that determined very largely the treatment
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.840]   meted out to the Jews as a people and as a nation, by the nations of the world, throughout the
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:33.760]   centuries. It was the decision of the Roman Church to put the entire blame upon the Jews as a nation.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.840]   They taught their people, therefore, to regard them as outsiders, as people with whom God had
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.200]   finished, and because they had been responsible for the enormity of the crucifixion, they should
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.840]   be made to suffer. Now, that, tragically, has been the reason why the Jews have received the
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.920]   treatment they have. And, as I say, only last week that Vatican Council decided to reverse that,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:04.240]   and they have now officially exonerated the Jews from this particular charge. Well, I am not
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.960]   disposed to spend any time upon the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church. All I am concerned to
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.400]   show is this, that they should never have adopted the other attitude. It was their failure to
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.280]   understand the teaching of these two verses, and indeed the one that follows, verse 13,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:30.720]   that was ever responsible for their being guilty of such an utterly indefensible attitude towards
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.120]   this nation and people. If they had only understood this teaching, they would never have done that.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.720]   If they had got hold of this idea that the Gentiles were saved partly to provoke the
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.480]   Jews to jealousy, they could never have shut and bolted and barred the door against them,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:55.440]   and treated them as the off-scourings of the human race. So that it is interesting to see
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.040]   how failure to interpret the Scriptures truly and to understand their message can lead to
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.200]   quite unexpected consequences. You see, when you are dealing with a great chapter like this,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.920]   you should always be looking out for some practical lesson. And if this, as I say,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.080]   had only been grasped, it would have saved a tremendous lot of suffering, and it would have
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.200]   spared the nations of the world from doing things that remain as a blot upon their national
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.000]   histories. And as for ourselves, the lesson is surely plain and clear. We should be concerned
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.920]   about this people. We should realize that as Gentile Christians, it is a call to us to rouse
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.760]   them to jealousy and to emulation, so that far from regarding them as in some peculiar people,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.840]   outside the scope of the Gospel, because they as a nation rejected their own Messiah,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.680]   we should feel a greater sense of compassion for them than perhaps for anybody else,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:05.160]   and do everything we can, therefore, to bring the Gospel to them. Very well. I leave that first
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:14.080]   section with those remarks. Now come to the second section. These two verses, this seminal
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   statement, as I am calling it, has a great deal to teach us with regard to God's ways. You can,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   if you like, call it a theodicy, a defense of the ways of God with respect to men. But there is
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.640]   very wonderful teaching here, and this becomes very practical to all of us. Now take the first
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:42.480]   thing that is obvious. The first lesson I find here is a warning, a warning concerning the mistake
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.920]   or the danger of jumping to conclusions. See, that is what has been done with regard to the
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.800]   Jesuses I have been showing you. It seemed so obvious, didn't it? Here they are as a nation
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.400]   rejecting the Gospel, rejecting their Messiah. Very well, you jump to the conclusion, that is
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.480]   the end of them, finished. God has no more interest in them. You say, clearly God has put them outside,
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:12.560]   and God has raised up the Roman Empire to sack the city of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, they have been
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.040]   thrown out amongst the nations, that is the end of them. There is no more to be said. It is so
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.520]   easy to jump to that sort of conclusion. Well now, we are reminded here by this teaching that when
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.120]   we are dealing with the affairs of God and God's dealings with nations or individuals, nothing is
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:36.240]   more fatal than to jump to conclusions. Oh, I could illustrate the way we do it so often. Christian
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.360]   people are taken ill and immediately they say, why does God do this to me? That is an instance of
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.240]   jumping to a conclusion. And those foolish questions which generally put themselves in
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:54.360]   this form, if God is God and a God is love, why then jumping to conclusions? Oh, the trouble that
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.040]   people get into and the misery that they bring upon themselves so needlessly simply because they
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.760]   jump to conclusions. Whatever else you may do when you are concerned about the dealings of God with
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.640]   you or with anybody else, never jump to a ready-made conclusion. You will almost certainly
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   be wrong. But let's go on. Why shouldn't you jump to conclusions? Well, here is one reason. God,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:30.720]   if I may so put it, knows what he's doing. God has got a plan. God never acts in a haphazard manner.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:39.840]   God never acts merely as the result of something that we or somebody else do. God always has a
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.640]   plan and a purpose. And he knows what he's doing. Of course, this is the very essence of this
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.520]   teaching. Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid. But rather, through their fall,
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.880]   salvation is come to the Gentiles, and then another, in order to provoke them to jealousy.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:06.960]   This is an impossible thing, apparently. Why has this happened to the Jews? It seems all wrong,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.440]   and as we saw in chapter 9, in verse 6, some people thought that the promises or the word
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:19.880]   of God had fallen down, was of no effect. But you see, that isn't so. There's a very great
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:26.480]   purpose here, this threefold purpose. God knows what he's doing. God's got a plan. There is a
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:37.040]   reason for this thing. But let me put that in the third place in this way. God's ways of working
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:46.360]   are very strange. And this is, of course, where people get into difficulty and into trouble. The
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:54.020]   ways of God are passing strange. And in our ignorance, we don't understand them, and because
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.440]   we don't understand them, we don't realize that they're God's ways. It all seems so wrong to us.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:08.080]   But this is the lesson to learn, that God so often works indirectly, and not directly. We are all
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:15.120]   such direct people. We've all got the penny-in-the-slot machine mentality, every one of us.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.560]   And we always want our blessings and everything like that. I do this, I get that. Shortcuts in
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.040]   the spiritual life to blessings and everything else. So simple, isn't it? Always direct and
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.200]   immediate. But you know, God doesn't work like that. The great characteristic of God's work
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.080]   indeed is that he's indirect. Seems to go a long way around. Look at him in nature and creation.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.680]   Look at the farmer plowing up the ground and breaking it up with his harrow and sowing the
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.760]   seed. But you don't get your crop the next day. You have to wait for months, months and months,
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.800]   and all sorts of things happen. But the harvest always comes. That's God's method of working.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.920]   It's very often indirect. And indeed, I can go even beyond that. He seems to be doing at times
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:09.960]   the exact opposite of what any sane man would expect him to do. And there are abundant instances
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:18.520]   of this. Here's the supreme instance. His own chosen people put out, as it were. And the point
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.440]   is that they're put out in order that they may be brought in. Now that's God. We are much too
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.400]   clever to accept things like that, aren't we? But that's how God works. That's why William Cowper,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:38.680]   you see, he saw it all, "Judge not the Lord by feeble sense." The moment you try to do that,
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:46.920]   you'll be wrong already. Don't try to judge him with your feeble sense. God moves in a mysterious
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:55.320]   way his wonders to perform. And at times, it seems to be the exact opposite. Now I read to you that
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:03.280]   great portion out of Isaiah 45 at the beginning, because that is the theme of that very chapter.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:09.520]   One of the most amazing things God ever did was to raise up this man Cyrus, who was a pagan,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.360]   and who didn't know God. God raised him up to use him with respect to his own people. Though he
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:22.680]   didn't know me, says God, I girded him. And then he goes on to make these extraordinary statements,
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:30.160]   you see, that "I form the light and I create darkness. I make peace and I create evil consequences."
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   Which you remember I expounded to you, it means, "I, the Lord, do all these things. From the east
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.840]   and from the west, I'm doing them all." And it seems to be contradictory, and it seems to be the
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:49.000]   opposite of everything that one would expect. God seems at times to be cutting across his own plan
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.880]   absolutely. He has his ultimate purpose with regard to these people. Now he seems to be throwing them
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:03.200]   right out, but he isn't. It's only for a while, it's temporary. And therefore, I say it is so vital
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:10.520]   and essential that we should grasp this great principle. Now, the Apostles already put this
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:18.680]   for us in the eighth chapter and in the 28th verse, where he says that "All things work together for
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.960]   good to them that love God." I can't remember whether I told you the story, the illustration
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   used by an old preacher many years ago in order to bring out this very point. It was, I think,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.200]   a very good illustration. Lest I didn't mention it, I will do so now. He took the illustration
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.920]   of a watch, and he opened up the back of the watch. Here's the watch, you see, that's going,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.560]   and the pins are moving. But then he opened the back, and he saw one wheel turning this way,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.280]   and another wheel up against it turning that way. And the old man said, "A man looks at that watch,
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.400]   and he says, 'This is madness. Here are wheels working in opposite directions. The whole thing
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   must be ridiculous.' But they're not." He said, "That's how the watch works. One moves this way
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.400]   in order to move the other the other way. And they're all working together. That's the thing.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.680]   And the ultimate result is that the watch keeps time, and the watch is going, and it helps you
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.400]   to know what time of day it is." Now, God's ways are like that. You read the Scriptures,
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   and you really will come to the conclusion that the plan and the purpose of God have gone entirely
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.560]   astray. And the psalmists, they're honest enough to say that. "Lord," they said, "have you forgotten
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   us? Has thou forgotten to be good? Has thou forgotten to be gracious? Where are you?" They
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.200]   say, "You're behaving like a wayfarer. You're acting like a stranger. Look what you're allowing.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.560]   You're allowing the exact opposite of what we expected you to do. You're allowing the ungodly
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.920]   to flourish, and we are all down, and we're all suffering." Now, God has constantly been doing
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:54.240]   that. And we, with our feeble sense, think that everything has gone wrong. The answer is, it
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:03.120]   hasn't. God does these things in order that, but rather through their fall, salvation has come to
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:15.040]   Israel for to provoke them to jealousy. My dear friend, God is over all. God sees the end from
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:22.600]   the beginning. Oh, well, let me give it to you again in the words of William Cowper. He's got
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:32.840]   it all really there. "Deep in unfathomable minds of never-failing skill, he treasures up his bright
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:44.600]   designs and works his sovereign will. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, but trust him for his
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.960]   grace. Behind the frowning providence he hides a father's face." How difficult it is to realize
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.640]   that at times. Don't judge him by feeble sense. Don't jump to conclusions. Don't say, "Because
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.400]   there are clouds there, God is against me." There's a face behind the clouds, and it's a
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:12.920]   father's face. His purposes will righten fast, unfolding every hour. The bird may have a bitter
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:23.240]   taste, but sweet will be the flower. Never forget the end. Blind unbelief. Ah, that's the enemy.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:30.440]   Unbelief is always blind. It can't see, and especially it can't see afar off. Blind unbelief
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:38.320]   is sure to err and scan his work in vain. Here's the answer. God is his own interpreter, and he's
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.480]   given it to you. We've got it. We're without excuse. These two verses are the key to most
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:51.240]   of these things that get us down. God is his own interpreter, and he will make it plain,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:57.960]   so that even if you can't grasp it and understand it now, you can be quite certain and sure that
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:06.200]   eventually you will. Very well, then, let's never forget this. God is over all, is behind all. He
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:14.840]   knows what he's doing. Trust him. Trust him, and keep your feeble sense in its right place.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:21.000]   All right, we leave that second matter, then, like that, and we go on now to a third point,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.160]   a third deduction, and a third principle of teaching, if you like. The wonderful light
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:35.440]   which this prophecy and statement cast upon past history—and I mean past history especially with
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.320]   respect to the Church. What am I referring to? Well, I'm referring to things like this. You know,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:48.040]   God has often implied the very method that the apostle is dealing with here. In other words,
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:54.400]   his basic teaching is that God has used the rejection of the Gospel on the part of the Jews
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   to promote the success of the Gospel amongst the Gentiles. Now, I think you've heard exactly the
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:06.720]   same thing at the time of the Protestant Reformation. There is no question at all
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.100]   but that the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformers and the
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:19.600]   early Protestants was one of the things that helped above everything else to spread the
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.480]   Gospel to the common people. Certainly it happened in this country. You see,
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.560]   Tyndale and others looked forward to that day when the ploughman would be reciting Scripture.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.800]   And the fact that the learned people and the authorities at the centre were so almost
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.000]   universally opposed to the Reformation and the giving of the Bible to the people,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.400]   it made them do it all the more. Read about it in the case of men like Tyndale and old Hugh Latimer
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.960]   and others. They forced them underground, as it were, but that increased their zeal in turn,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.240]   and there is no doubt but that the very persecution of the Protestants by the Roman
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.280]   Catholic Church was a means under the hand of God of spreading the Gospel in a much more rapid manner
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   and in a wider manner and especially to the common people than would have happened otherwise.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:15.400]   If the doctors of the Church, as it were, had all accepted this new teaching which had come
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.320]   from Luther and others, well, it might very well have stopped with them and would have
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.200]   taken much longer to get through to the masses of the people. But because of the attitude of
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.320]   the Church of Rome, it happened, as I say, the other way round. There is God doing once more
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   this very thing that Paul tells us he did in the first century. And I am equally convinced that he
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.880]   did very much the same thing in connection with the Puritan movement of the seventeenth century
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:49.120]   and the great evangelical awakening of the eighteenth century. There can be no question
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.200]   at all but that it was the attitude of so many of the bishops and clergy to George Whitefield
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:02.560]   and to the Wesley brothers and their other helpers that drove them to take the Gospel
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.920]   out into the open air and to the masses of the people. As the churches in London, for instance,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.960]   were refused to Whitefield and the Wesleyans, they drove them to preach in the graveyards
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.960]   and on Kennington Common and out there in Moorgate and in various other places.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:27.600]   The opposition of the official Church drove them out to the people. And so the common people were
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.280]   able to hear the Gospel in a way that would not have been possible if the churches had been kept
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:41.320]   open still to these great evangelical preachers, filled and baptized with the Spirit of God as
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:50.560]   they were. So, you see, God has used this method. Now, I want to put a question at this point. There
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.600]   we have been looking back at history and we have seen what has happened. I cannot but feel that
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:08.120]   all this is of very great significance to us at this present time. Is this a law in connection
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:16.160]   with the spread of the Gospel? Are we perhaps living in an age when God is again doing this?
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:27.200]   Is it possible, I wonder, that the Church, the official Church, is the greatest obstacle to the
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.120]   Gospel getting to the masses of the people today? I fear that there is a great deal to be said for
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:43.240]   that idea. And it may well be that this will be the means in this century which God will use of
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:50.320]   sending the good news of salvation to these people whom we tend to regard as utterly hopeless that
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:57.960]   are outside. You see, they are to us what the Gentiles were to the Jews at the time of our Lord.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:04.440]   The Gentiles were dogs. They were ignorant. They were so hopeless that there was nothing for them
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.720]   at all. Only the Jews were the people of God and the Messiah was to come to them and to them the
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.160]   good news was to come. But it turned out to be the exact opposite. And their very rejection of it
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:22.000]   was the means God used to bring it to the others. Now, you see, we are in grave danger, beloved
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.120]   Christian people. Let's learn a lesson from this. Are we getting into the position of these Jews at
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:34.520]   the time of our Lord and at the time of the great Apostle? Is our attitude to these whom we regard
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:42.600]   as complete outsiders such that God may have to put us on one side and may even use our utter
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.320]   rumbness as a means of bringing the gospel to those people? There are many indications of this,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.840]   it seems to me, today. The confusion in the Church herself, the tendency of so many Christians to
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.240]   live a little confined, cramped life, putting a hedge around themselves, and their attitude
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.160]   towards those who are outside. My friends, if the gospel can't save your muds and rockers and all
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   these others of whom we see so much and to whom we tend to react so violently, if the gospel can't
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:18.600]   save them, it's no gospel. Why are the masses of the people outside the Church in this country today?
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:26.360]   Why do all the efforts of the Church fail to touch the working people so called? Why is
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.160]   Christianity becoming increasingly and almost exclusively a middle-class movement? There's
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:37.640]   something wrong. We need to examine ourselves in the light of the teaching of these two verses,
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:44.160]   this great principle that is here enunciated. So often we've seen in the past, God, as it were,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.520]   has to do this very thing with the official Church, which he did with the nation of Israel,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.600]   in order to spread the gospel to those who are regarded as completely outside. Very well,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   I leave it at that. But come, let us go on from there to a fourth general point,
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:06.360]   which follows out of the last one. Here then, I think, we are given very valuable teaching
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:12.680]   with respect to our attitude as—now I'm speaking now to evangelical believers—our
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:21.120]   attitude to formal Church members and apostate churches. That's the point, that's what we're
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:28.080]   dealing with. The Jews, don't forget, we're God's people. They are the natural seed of Abraham,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:34.920]   the nation of Israel. That's the thing we're dealing with. Now then, what corresponds to that
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:42.520]   today, of course, is formal Church members, or as I say, even apostate churches. Churches which
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.840]   are churches in name, but which have lost the Spirit and which deny the truth rather than
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.720]   preach it. And that is the position to which we are rapidly advancing if we have not already
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.840]   reached it. What should be our attitude towards such churches or towards such individuals?
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.160]   And it seems to me the answer is quite plain here. There are two things only at this point.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.840]   The first is, of course, separation. The Church, as the Book of Acts teaches us,
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.720]   had to separate from the synagogue. They had to go out. We've dealt with it. The apostles,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.200]   they offered the message first to the Jews. They were told to start in Jerusalem, then Samaria,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.000]   and then the outermost parts of the earth, and they invariably started with the Jews,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.800]   and they went to the synagogues. But as you remember in Antioch of Pisidia, as we saw in
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.840]   our reading last Friday night in the 13th of Acts, when they finally refused, the apostles said,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:42.760]   "Very well, then, as you refused, henceforth go I to the Gentiles." And they all did the same.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.240]   And so the Jews, as such, were left. If any Jews liked to come and listen, of course,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:55.400]   they were welcome. But as a nation and as a body, they no longer remained in the same position.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.560]   The preachers turned to the Gentiles, and the Church, as a result, became chiefly a Gentile
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:07.320]   Church. Now that's what I say is the principle of separation. You cannot possibly remain in
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.240]   an apostate Church. You've got to separate yourself from unbelief and from error,
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.160]   and from everything which denies the Gospel. But secondly, and don't forget this second
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:28.440]   principle is as important as the first, though we have to separate, our deepest desire should
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:35.200]   be to provoke them to jealousy and to emulation. In other words, when you feel you're compelled
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.920]   to leave an apostate body, don't dismiss it, as it were, in your mind and in your spirit.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:49.120]   Be concerned about it. Yes, it is rather through their fall salvation has come into the Gentiles,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:57.360]   for to provoke them to jealousy. And that should be our object. It's very difficult to do this.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.600]   The difficulty always is to adopt a hard and a harsh attitude towards those whom you know to
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.920]   be wrong. The fact that you can't go on with them doesn't mean that you shut the door and say,
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.520]   "Finished, no more." No, no. We should be concerned about them, and I'll develop this still more in
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.560]   the 13th verse. We should be concerned about them, and we should always have as our ultimate aim and
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   objective to provoke them to jealousy. We should say to ourselves, "Well, now, we'll show them what
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.520]   a true church is. We'll show them what a true Christian is." How often have I had to say this
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:36.560]   in my pastoral duties when people come to me in this kind of situation? A man or a woman may come
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:42.780]   to me, young or old, and here's the problem. They say, "I'm the only Christian in my family. What
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:49.000]   am I to do?" Sometimes I've had this problem put to me, "Should I leave home?" I've done my best.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.200]   I've put it to them. I've prayed for them, but they seem to be more antagonistic the more I put
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.960]   it to them. And they say, "Should I leave?" Well, I'm simply trying to give you the principle tonight.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:06.180]   The thing I always say on such occasions is this, "The last thing you do is to leave." Now, I'm not
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.640]   talking about churches there, you see. I'm talking about family relationships. But the thing that I
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:17.960]   always try to impress upon them is this. I say, "You may be talking too much. The biggest thing
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:27.760]   you've got to do is this. You've so got to live the Christian life before that you will force them
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:34.640]   to begin to think that you've got something wonderful which they haven't got, and gradually
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.880]   they will begin to feel they'd like to have it also." That's exactly what "provoke to jealousy
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.680]   and emulation" means. I say, "Now, don't just hammer the gospel at them. Don't simply speak to
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.480]   them, still less, don't condemn them." I say, "Go out of your way to win them. Go out of your way
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.360]   to be kind and helpful. Go out of your way to put yourself on one side and to suffer if necessary.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.840]   Live your Christian life in such a way and in such a manner that they'll be compelled to say,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:08.720]   'Well, there is something wonderful in this after all,' and that'll begin to set them thinking,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.600]   seeking, searching, and eventually it may lead to their salvation." Now, I say, "We are called
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:21.740]   upon to do that with individuals. We are called upon to do that with regard to churches which we
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:28.120]   may regard as apostate. Our ultimate objective should be to win them, to provoke them to
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:36.600]   emulation by seeing the fruits of salvation in us." Very well, that brings me to my next point,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.800]   which is this one, a word of comfort and of encouragement. I needn't stay with this,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.720]   it's obvious. But it's the most wonderful and the most comforting and consoling thought.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.880]   What we are taught here is this, you see, that there is nothing impossible with God.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.600]   Nothing and no one is impossible and hopeless where God is concerned. What could have appeared
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.760]   more hopeless than the case of the Jews as a nation? What can appear more hopeless than the
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:08.040]   Jews as a nation tonight? And yet we have this definite, certain promise that the fullness of
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:17.960]   the nation is going to come in. Nothing shall be impossible with God. Now then, that applies to
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:24.400]   nations and to individuals. You may think of some individual, it may be somebody who's very dear to
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.200]   you. You may think he's hopeless or she is hopeless. It may be somebody in the grip of some
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.920]   terrible sin, drunkenness or something like that. Doesn't matter what it is. You may say,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:43.560]   "It's absolutely hopeless." Never say that again. With God, nothing shall be impossible. If God can
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:50.080]   bring back in fullness the nation of Israel that rejected and crucified the Messiah, He can do it
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.040]   with anybody, any nation or any individual. The most hopeless can be saved. Why, look at the
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:01.080]   Gentiles, how hopeless they were. Look at the descriptions we have given of them in the different
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:06.040]   parts of the New Testament. Yet they've come in. Look at what Paul says of those people in Corinth,
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:12.920]   "Drunkards, murderers, abusers of themselves with mankind, effeminate, such were some of you,
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.280]   but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.000]   by the power of our God." Nothing is impossible with God. It's proclaimed as loudly as can be,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.960]   in these two verses that we are looking at. Indeed, I would almost go to the extent of saying
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:37.560]   this, that there may well be more hope for the hopeless masses outside the church today than
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:44.320]   there is for the church herself. I'm rapidly coming to that conclusion. There are times when
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:50.560]   I almost despair of the church, but I know that the God who has worked amongst the godless,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:58.520]   hopeless masses in past centuries can do it again. Whatever the condition of men and women
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:06.200]   in sin tonight, as Christians, we must never lose hope with respect to them. The Gentiles came in.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.520]   The dogs, the outsiders, were the very ones who came in. Or as our Lord put it in his famous
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:19.760]   parable, you remember of the two sons in Matthew 21, he said to the Pharisees, "That is why the
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:27.640]   publicans and the harlots come into the kingdom of God before you and rather than you." That's
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.920]   how it's been throughout the centuries. It may very well be like that in this century.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:42.400]   So my final word is this. These verses call us to humility. Humility in our understanding
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:51.120]   particularly, humility in our thinking, humility in our minds. There's danger to jump to conclusions
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:57.640]   and because we can't understand to draw conclusions, let's be humble. Let's realize we know nothing.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:05.320]   And let that drive us to consider him who is over all. We are in God's work, my friends,
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:12.360]   not men's. The church is not a human institution, nor a human society, nor organization. Thanks
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.680]   be to God. It doesn't depend upon us and our abilities. It's God and his purpose.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:27.040]   These purposes shall ripen fast. Nothing can stop them. They are sure and certain because
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:33.960]   they are God's. Therefore I say, let us humble ourselves in adoring wonder and admiration
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:48.760]   before him and let our faith be in him, his purpose, his will, his love, and his almighty
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:56.800]   power. Well, there are some, it seems to me, of the lessons that are taught us by verses
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:06.360]   11 and 12 of the 11th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. Let us pray.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:18.160]   O Lord, our God, we come back unto thee and we convert. Pause in thy holy presence, realizing
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:28.480]   our smallness and our foolishness and our readiness to speak without thinking. O God,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:36.640]   thou art gracious and kind, thou art loving and compassionate. Thou dost bear with us
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   as little children. We humbly thank thee. And now, O Lord, we look up unto thee. We
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:51.280]   glory in the fact that thou art who and what thou art and that we know that thy purposes
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.480]   are sure, that nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:10.160]   Jesus our Lord, that nothing can ever make thee, thy purpose, forgo. O Lord, receive
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   our worshipping, adoration, and prayers. We yield ourselves to thee. O Lord, forgive us
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:25.080]   for our foolish business. Help us to see that we are but to be thine instruments and to
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.960]   yield ourselves and all we are and have to thee and to the power of thy might and to
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:40.760]   thy way. Cure us, O God, our God. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:47.120]   Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:53.520]   and continue with us now this night throughout the remainder of this hour's short uncertain
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.760]   earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
