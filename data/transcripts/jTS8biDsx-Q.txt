[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Brian writes in to ask this,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.600]   Pastor John, I logged into my wife's Facebook account
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.980]   yesterday as I sometimes do in order to keep up
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.480]   with family and friends.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.920]   I don't really use Facebook, I don't post.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240]   My wife was at home and also logged on
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.960]   and she was having a private chat with her best friend.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.760]   The message feature pops up automatically
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.240]   in your show and the conversation, so I saw it.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.000]   And they were talking about me.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240]   They were not speaking kindly at all.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.760]   In fact, they were discussing my faults among comments
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.560]   about my personal struggles with depression.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.380]   My wife messaged a few extremely private topics
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.220]   to this friend.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.560]   I was heartbroken.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.840]   How would you advise spouses on what they should
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.320]   and should not share with friends or family?
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   - Here are five or six ideas or guidelines
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.440]   that have helped me.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.480]   Noel and I have faced this and I've blown it a few times
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.220]   and I'll mention one of those to give you hope at the end.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.220]   These ideas or guidelines are based on the assumption
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.940]   that the struggles a husband and wife have
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.440]   are normal hardships of getting along
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.200]   when expectations are different
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.960]   and there are more or less frequent disappointments in life.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.300]   I'm not talking about illegal behaviors
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.900]   or life-threatening situations.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.740]   So I just wanted to clear that from the beginning.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.820]   So here's idea number one or principle number one.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.340]   I think we should follow Matthew 18, 15,
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.620]   which says, "If you find your brother or sister
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.260]   sinning against you, taking the fall,
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.600]   you go to them first."
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.380]   In other words, there's a real effort not to gossip,
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.100]   the real effort not to tell anybody else
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.260]   what you've just seen or found in a person
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180]   and how much more spouses, right?
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.540]   So I'm assuming that there have been serious efforts
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.160]   on the part of a husband or a wife
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   to deal together privately with what their struggles are
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.860]   before these other principles kick into play.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.520]   Number two, the words of Jesus that we do unto others,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580]   what we would have them do unto us
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.420]   is profoundly significant in marriage.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.300]   And I feel warranted to say that and to apply that
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.520]   because of the way Paul, amazingly, in Ephesians 5,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.940]   takes that command, do unto others,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.540]   he would have them do unto you,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.620]   and he applies it to a husband's love for his wife.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.700]   He says, "In the same way,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.340]   husbands should love their wives as their own bodies."
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.020]   It's like love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.740]   applied to husband, "As your own bodies.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.240]   He who loves his wife loves himself."
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.660]   So Paul draws out the implication,
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.520]   not only that we should measure our words and our actions
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.940]   by whether we would want our wives or husbands
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.500]   to treat us that way,
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.740]   but also that when we treat each other that way,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.780]   we're really blessing ourselves.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.340]   We're doing something really good for ourselves
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.860]   not to betray each other's trust.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.100]   So the golden rule becomes hugely significant
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.020]   in whether that woman on Facebook
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.580]   is doing something she would want her husband
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.680]   to do with his friends about her.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.840]   And if she doesn't want him to do that,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.320]   she should shut her Facebook.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.160]   Number three, the third goes like this.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.360]   Wives should think long and hard
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.260]   about whether what they are saying to their husbands
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.560]   and about their husbands in public or in private
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.600]   is honoring or respecting their husbands
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.760]   because of Ephesians 5:33.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.960]   "Let each one of you love his wife
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.700]   and let the wife," actually it says,
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.060]   "love his wife as himself,
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.620]   and let the wife see that she respects her husband,"
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.600]   reveres him.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   Is this behavior, are these words spoken this way
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.140]   in this time, in this place, a respectful behavior?
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.400]   Similarly, the husbands should think long and hard
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.000]   whether what they're saying about their wives
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.540]   in private or in public
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.560]   honors them as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.520]   the way Peter talks in 1 Peter 1, 7.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.480]   So that's the third, the principle of respect
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.360]   and reverence and honor.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   And the fourth one is that we should seek permission
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   from our spouses to share the problems of our marriage
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   with one or two very trusted couples or friends
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.980]   that both of us agree on.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.340]   This is so important.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.480]   This was so important, is so important for Noel and me.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.520]   We've walked through this numerous times,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.960]   talked it through numerous times,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   namely to agree on one couple or one guy or two
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.740]   that I ask her, "May I share with David and John,
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.180]   may I share with them what we talk about?
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.460]   May I share with them what is so frustrating?
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.940]   May I basically share with them anything
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.820]   in our relationship that I think would be,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.340]   would enable them to help me love you better?"
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.500]   Which is so different than gossip and venting.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.980]   So we do that.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.380]   Noel can say whatever she wants to X
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.960]   and I can say whatever I want to Y,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.980]   and we have entrusted each other to those friends.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.420]   It's a huge thing.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.340]   You don't do that unless you've got some very close friends.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.060]   So I can speak freely, she can speak freely
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.140]   'cause we've agreed.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.940]   And I would frankly encourage all couples
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.460]   to have those kinds of friends.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.780]   Do you have friends like that,
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.260]   that you could actually entrust your personal lives to,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.400]   to know that it will not go beyond them
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.140]   and it will not come back and be used against you?
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.680]   So get permission.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.660]   I blew that.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.780]   I really blew that one time.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.740]   I can remember so clearly mentioning something
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.420]   in public at church and Noel was so angry with me
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.220]   when I got home because I hadn't talked to her about it.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.560]   And I was, she was so right about that.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.000]   And we got that, we got that healed,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.300]   but I wanted you to be encouraged.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.660]   There is one more.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.620]   I would say finally that even if you have permission
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.540]   to share specific family issues,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.620]   you should do it with the greatest of care.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.700]   Things easily degenerate
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.980]   into simply venting our frustrations.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.100]   And a wise friend will call us out on that.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.500]   They'll just call us out.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.320]   No, you're not speaking in an edifying way here.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.900]   You're not seeking help out of love here.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.940]   You just are dumping and this is not helpful.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.380]   You need to love her better than this
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.100]   or love him better than this
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.580]   and turn towards something more edifying.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.900]   We should ask whether we are,
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.180]   ask ourselves whether we are sharing
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.180]   the right amount of detail or is it too much?
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.520]   It could get very unseemly.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.620]   Whether we are sharing it in the right tone,
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.700]   whether we're using the right medium.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.780]   Like I doubt that Facebook is ever the right medium.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.700]   Good grief.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.360]   Any kind of media that would run the risk
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.920]   of someone else listening in on what is meant
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.700]   for one person, we would avoid that at all costs.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.160]   So I have a lot of sympathy for this concern.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.640]   All of those, it seems to me, should be taken into account.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.340]   Even when we're talking with somebody
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.640]   we've both agreed on, we can trust.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.360]   And of course, I'm assuming that all of this
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.120]   will be in the context of praying for and with our spouse
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.640]   and reading Scripture with our spouse
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.880]   so that we seek help from God who alone can keep us married
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.180]   and bring this relationship
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.320]   to a God-honoring, satisfying situation.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.840]   And some of these things I've had to learn
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.600]   in a very hard way, as I said.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.240]   And I just want to close on the note of hope
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   that if some breach of trust has happened,
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.480]   there is a way forward.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.040]   There can be repentance and forgiveness.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.000]   I know that from personal experience.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.080]   Noel and I are in a really good place after 46 years,
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.880]   and we've really blown it more than once.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.120]   That is hope-giving for all of us married couples.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.320]   and thank you for your openness here today.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   We are closing in on the weekend,

[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.800]   to talk about whether or not Christians need to learn
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.400]   to forgive ourselves.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.360]   We'll see you then.
