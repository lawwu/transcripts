[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   In the last podcast, in episode 178, I asked you, "Can a sinner repent and be saved in
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.060]   the final moments leading up to their death?"
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.320]   And here's a related follow-up question that some listeners have asked.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.520]   Pastor John, can a sinner repent and be saved after death?
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.020]   The answer is no.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.640]   And there are several passages of Scripture that make me clear about that.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   I remember, again, my father preaching, and I can see the kind of squint in his eyes when
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.840]   he quoted Hebrews 9, which he did numerous times.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:55.620]   He said, "It is appointed to a man once to die, and after that comes judgment."
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.060]   And he would just say, "When you die, here's what you look forward to, judgment."
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.740]   Not some kind of intervening space where you get another chance.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.100]   But the most clear passage of Scripture is Luke 16 and the story of Lazarus and the rich
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.660]   man.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.100]   People may remember that Lazarus was poor and sat at the door of the rich man.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.340]   The rich man walked by him indifferently every day, manifesting that he had no love for him,
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.740]   no trust in God, and they both die.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.020]   And Lazarus, who evidently had been trusting in God, goes to Abraham's bosom and is rewarded
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.500]   and relieved of all his lifetime of suffering with delights and pleasures in the presence
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   of God.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.700]   And the rich man goes to a place of torment and anguish where he's longing to have just
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.060]   a drop of water put on his tongue.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:02.380]   And there's this imaginary conversation that Jesus creates between them, and he says, "Can't
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.820]   you just send Lazarus down here?"
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.100]   And Jesus says, "No, I can't, because there is a gap."
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.180]   Verse 26 of Luke 16, "Besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been fixed in
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.420]   order that those who would pass from here to you cannot do it, and no one can cross
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.140]   from there to us."
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.940]   So one of the reasons there's no salvation after death is that there's this chasm fixed.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.060]   And I think the reason it's fixed is because the Holy Spirit is poured out on this world
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.700]   to bring people to conviction of sin, and there is no Holy Spirit promised in hell.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.100]   And if we push Jesus away and refuse to yield to the work of the gospel in our hearts, in
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.660]   this world, there'll be no reason to think that our hearts will be softened in the conflicts
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.460]   or in the torments of hell.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.420]   I can think, Tony, of one possible exception to this.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.660]   And let me bring it up because it comes up all the time, namely infants who die.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.140]   And here I just admit I'm in the area of speculation.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.860]   I don't think the Bible says explicitly what I'm about to say, and so people should take
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.340]   it carefully.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.460]   It seems to me that there are pointers in the Bible, like Romans 1, 19-23, and John
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:54.700]   9, 41, that God's desire for public justice to be done and manifested will lead Him not
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:03.900]   to bring infants who die into everlasting judgment and condemnation, which raises the
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.700]   question, "Well, how then will they come to faith in Jesus, who alone is their Savior?"
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.540]   And so I'm leaving open the possibility that in some way that I do not know and don't want
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.340]   to speculate too far about, God might be pleased to make that possible for them to come to
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.220]   faith after death.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:37.660]   But the context for those who have mental frameworks whereby they can construe the evidences
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.180]   that are available to all human beings, it says in Romans 1, those people who resist
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.820]   God and suppress the truth that is available to all human beings who have the mental processes
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.140]   to grasp them, those people will pass into judgment for which there is no second chance.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.740]   And so the urgency, hence the urgency of the call to people all over the world to believe,
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.740]   hence my commitment to world missions, my love for this conference that's coming in
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.100]   December about the cross and its mobilizing of young people to reach the nations of the
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.540]   world, the implications of believing that there's no second chance beyond death are
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.060]   very, very serious and big.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.060]   Yes, it certainly is.
