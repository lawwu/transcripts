[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   What I've been working on is exactly what you described, which is how to train and play
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.000]   with the state-of-the-art image generative model in a notebook on a single GPU.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.240]   And as with all of these things, the trick is to start with an easier but equivalent
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700]   problem.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.140]   So I'm doing all my work just about on the fashion MNIST dataset.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.760]   So yeah, I think there's lots of opportunities for people like you and me to play in this
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760]   field.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.420]   I mean, I know there is, because I've started spending time talking to some of the folks
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.520]   who were the primary researchers responsible for the key components of stable diffusion,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.060]   and I'm already telling them things that they hadn't thought of before by virtue of weird
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.000]   little experiments I've done with fashion MNIST on my single GPU Jupyter notebook.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.840]   (upbeat music)
