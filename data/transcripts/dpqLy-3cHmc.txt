[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.640]   It's amazing how people can't differentiate
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.040]   between say the narrow AI that allows a car
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.480]   to figure out what a lane line is
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.480]   and navigate streets versus general intelligence.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.440]   Like these are just very different things.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.120]   Like your toaster and your computer are both machines,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.480]   but one's much more sophisticated than another.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   - You're confident with Tesla you can create
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000]   the world's best toaster?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.600]   - The world's best toaster, yes.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.120]   The world's best self-driving.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.400]   Yes.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.840]   To me right now this seems game set match.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160]   I don't want to be complacent or overconfident,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.600]   but that's what it, that is just literally
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000]   how it appears right now.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.720]   I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.200]   that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone.

[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.520]   (gentle music)
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.100]   (gentle music)
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.680]   (gentle music)
