[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.540]   Today we finish up our 2015 conference
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.940]   for pastors here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.640]   The conference festivities this morning
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.640]   will be streamed online and you can go to
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.800]   DesiringGod.org/live for the schedule of events
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.620]   and to find the video stream.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.920]   On the podcast today we're joined again by a man
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.660]   who once ventured into a Minneapolis winter
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.200]   for one of our pastors conference
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   and who vowed to never do it again, Matt Chandler,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.960]   the lead pastor at the Village Church.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.500]   He joins us by phone from the warmth of Dallas.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.200]   Matt is the author of the new book,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840]   "The Mingling of Souls,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.000]   God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360]   And we're working through 10 questions on relationships
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   and we're moving on to question number five, Matt.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   This is a very common question from single men that we get.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.920]   If I'm not physically attracted to a godly woman,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.640]   should I still try to romantically pursue her
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.120]   in order to cultivate those feelings?
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   If so, for how long until it becomes unwise or even hurtful?
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.600]   - Yeah, I don't encourage a young man
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.840]   to pursue a godly woman romantically
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.840]   that he doesn't feel he's physically attracted to at the time
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.780]   but what I do adamantly encourage young single men to do
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.380]   is to pursue godly women for friendships
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.500]   in the hopes that it does grow into more.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.740]   And so there are, in fact, I did a wedding this past year
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860]   of one of the guys that kind of spent time at my house
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.900]   and had been around Lauren and I a ton
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.620]   and just really saw this young woman at our church
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.020]   that they were so faithful to serve the Lord
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.540]   and such a godly woman,
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.940]   but just that physical piece wasn't there,
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.980]   but he loved hanging out with her, loved.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.460]   And so, man, I just encouraged him,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.660]   hey man, just stay in proximity, grow in your friendship,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.580]   and let's hope that something grows from there.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.420]   And so I wouldn't want him, for her sake, to just go,
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.600]   hey, I'm gonna romantically pursue you
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.580]   in the hopes that one day I am physically attracted to you
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.100]   because I just believe, I keep saying it,
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.900]   that godliness is sexy to godly people.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   And so if you get in proximity
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.340]   and you see the godliness and character of a woman,
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.340]   or you begin to take more serious compatibility
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.860]   and godliness and gospel partnership
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.180]   than just physical attraction,
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.620]   and in the first part of mingling,
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.740]   I really address attraction as a good thing,
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.380]   but not at the level to where our culture has put it,
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.940]   because gravity always wins.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.580]   I mean, you can be physically attracted to someone,
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.900]   but we're all wrinkling, we're all, you know,
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   the nose and the ears never quit growing.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.700]   I mean, it's only a matter of time
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.220]   till that little component that we're basing so much on
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.660]   starts to vanish and is replaced by an attraction
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.980]   founded on character and covenant.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.580]   And so a way that I've tried to help people understand this
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.140]   is when I got cancer,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.780]   everything that was sexy about me vanished.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.460]   My strength, my vibrancy, my sense of humor,
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.300]   my creative romantic pursuit of Lauren,
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.420]   all of that was gone for two years.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   And my hair's out, and I just become a shriveled up version
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.420]   of what I was before the cancer.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.900]   And thank God that Lauren's not going, "Man,
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.920]   "I'm just not physically attracted to him right now."
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.660]   But she entered into covenant with me,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.120]   loved the character that God had formed in my heart,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.340]   and now my character, my godliness,
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.860]   are what fuel her attraction to me physically.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.660]   And so I think we've got it backwards.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.160]   I think we've been discipled by the culture
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.220]   that physical sexual attraction is first,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.880]   then once that's there,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.540]   then let's see if character, godliness,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.020]   and compatibility is there.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.100]   And I think it's backwards.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.100]   I think character, compatibility, godliness,
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.600]   once those are there, I think those fuel attraction
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.160]   in the way that would please God
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.280]   and is much safer for our souls.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.440]   But at the same time, I wanna protect the heart,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.720]   particularly of young women,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160]   from godly men teasing them with pursuit.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.840]   And so I wanna be careful answering this question.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.680]   So I say pursue 'em as friends
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.080]   and hope that it grows into more
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.540]   and want it to grow into more.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.120]   And I'm confident that over time,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.260]   character and godliness win the day.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.080]   - Thank you for that wisdom.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.800]   That's Matt Chandler, the lead pastor
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.460]   at the Village Church in Dallas,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.880]   and tomorrow we'll return.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.120]   I'll ask whether or not a boyfriend
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.160]   should lead his girlfriend.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.920]   If so, how and when and where?
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.520]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.700]   (silence)
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.860]   (silence)
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.020]   (silence)
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
