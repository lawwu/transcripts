[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   We have a leadership question for you today.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.400]   Hello, Pastor John, in your time as a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church, over all those
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.260]   30 plus years, did you ever use strategies aimed at church growth?
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.980]   How would you counsel pastors and churches who seek to grow numerically and reach more
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.800]   people while doing so in the most biblically faithful way possible?
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.240]   How would you answer this leadership question, Pastor John?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.200]   I'm really happy for this question because I don't think we've tackled this in all the
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.040]   900 plus.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.640]   I tried to communicate to our people continually that in view of the glory of Christ, His purpose
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.640]   is to be magnified in the world through believing people, the vast lostness of millions and
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.600]   millions of people near and far, the horrors of hell, the beauties and the power of the
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.240]   gospel, the nature of love, the truth that it's more blessed to give than to receive.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.720]   I tried to communicate in view of all that, not rescuing perishing people is not an option
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.440]   for us.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.480]   It's also not possible for us since only God can raise the dead and open the eyes of the
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.200]   blind and take out stony hearts of unbelief.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.360]   So our first strategy of growth was prayer.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   I tried to create a culture of desperation for all the things that matter most, which
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   are the ones that only God can do.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.320]   Christians can't do it, evangelists can't do it, pastors can't do it, friends can't
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.760]   do it.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.200]   We scattered prayer meetings all through the week besides encouraging families and small
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.440]   groups to pray and individuals, of course, to pray for the impossible goal of getting
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.500]   sinners through the eye of a needle, which only God can do that miracle.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.840]   We also knew, however, that faith comes by hearing.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.880]   So not sharing the gospel with a view to seeing people believe and be saved and be part of
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.960]   God's family forever was not an option for us.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.640]   The term "church growth," however, had connotations for us that were not so good,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.980]   at least in the circles in which I function and my people.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.040]   So much depends on where the accent falls when you talk about church growth.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.240]   Abuses of pragmatism, minimization of theology, dilution of the gospel, dumbing down of serious
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.680]   joyful worship in a way that came to be known as "seeker-sensitive."
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.580]   All these things were associated in our language with the church growth movement, which is
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.480]   sad because there's nothing wrong with growing.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.760]   In fact, I wanted to say we must pursue growth.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:17.400]   But in that context, my suggestion to pastors is that you use biblical language constantly
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.840]   to permeate your people's minds with something other than catchphrases that are in seminars
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.680]   like "church growth."
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.160]   The great challenge is not to become a bigger and bigger church, but to see more and more
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   people escape the wrath of God.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.320]   Ask your people that.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.480]   If they say, "Oh, I don't know if that church growth stuff is biblical," say, "How about
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120]   escaping wrath?
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.120]   Is that good?"
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   So you put it in categories like that.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.760]   Ultimately, it didn't matter whether the people who escaped wrath through faith in
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.480]   Jesus went to our church or not.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.040]   That's quite secondary.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.800]   What ultimately mattered was in every community, are people hearing the gospel?
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   Are they believing?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   Are they escaping the wrath of God?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.640]   Are they getting full of the Holy Spirit?
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.340]   Are they participating in biblical churches?
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.400]   It's not about our particular church getting bigger and bigger.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.560]   And when the people understand church growth in those categories, then I think a pastor
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.520]   can say, which I did, "Not growing is not an option for us."
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.840]   And they knew what I meant when I said that.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.680]   At least if you live in a metropolitan area with several hundred thousand unbelievers,
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   that's true.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.720]   You might live in a small town where everybody's lined up somewhere, and growth is not a very
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.000]   big possibility.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.240]   But if you live in the Twin Cities or in any place where you have a few thousand unbelievers,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.820]   you can talk like that.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.720]   This can be, however, and here's a great obstacle, this can be very unsettling for
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   a church.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.320]   There are a lot of people, shame on them, for whom they're just happy with these 50
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   people.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   And they're happy with these 150.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.560]   And they're happy with these 350.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080]   Or they're happy with these 500.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.860]   And frankly, they don't like all these strange faces around here.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.700]   It's just not as comfortable as it used to be here when we all knew each other.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.600]   That is an anti-gospel attitude, and it is deadly in the church.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.620]   And a pastor must so preach and teach as to overcome it.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.400]   He needs to ask, "Do we believe people are perishing forever without the gospel?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.560]   And do we love them?"
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Those two questions.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.980]   The first one is theological, and the second one is moral and spiritual.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.920]   Are we thinking right about heaven and hell and faith and gospel?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.660]   And are we feeling compassion like Paul, who agonized over his lost kinsmen in Romans 9,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.060]   2 and 10, 1?
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.180]   So once that foundation of right thinking about the gospel and right loving was laid,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.260]   I went after dozens of growth strategies over the years.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.460]   I mean, so many, I can't even begin to remember them.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.240]   Remember them all.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.260]   But I want to, before I list some of them, let me just say that I tried to stress that
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.860]   the normal, never-changing, bread-and-butter, steady-state, New Testament pattern of outreach
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.780]   and evangelism is not programmatic.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.360]   It's not event-oriented.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.220]   It's not primarily through the Sunday morning services.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:35.140]   It is through the ordinary permeation of the city, through believers in their neighborhoods,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.660]   at work, at school, in families, opening their mouths and testifying to the value of Jesus.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.780]   That's normal, steady-state, New Testament strategies for growth.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:55.020]   And I think that that mindset about the everyday life of gospel spreading is the main mindset
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.420]   and needs to be cultivated because if you create the mindset that the people are going
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:08.580]   to move from just one pragmatic, programmatic basket to another, here comes one event, here
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.180]   comes another event, here comes another strategy, they get jaundiced to these things.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.220]   Instead, we need to thrill the people, interpreting week after week with the glories of being a
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.820]   Christian so that it oozes through their lives.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:33.980]   But having said that that's the steady-state, bread-and-butter, normative, always-never-changing
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.900]   strategy of growth, I just want to say, yes.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:47.140]   I came to this church and I created immediately a gospel pamphlet that described the gospel.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.740]   It described something about our church.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.220]   It had a map on the back.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.940]   I made hundreds of them.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.220]   I put them in the hands of the people.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:59.220]   I said, "Use these to share the gospel with people and invite them to church if you want
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   to."
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.580]   We put ads in the newspapers.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.660]   This is pre-internet stuff.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.780]   And we always had special efforts to invite people on Easter and Christmas.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.540]   I always worked hard to create enough parking because I knew if people can't find a place
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.700]   to tie up their horse, they're not going to come in.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.820]   We tried to make it friendly at the front end by creating guests, I mean, greeters who
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.540]   would greet guests and strategies to make them feel warm.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.940]   We went to two services and then three services and then a Saturday night service because
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.700]   we believed that making room was a way of growth.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.740]   In the early days for say 10, 15 years, all the way along really, I encouraged people
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.660]   to move into the poorer neighborhoods of the city where there's less gospel witness so
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.700]   that hundreds of people over the 30 years or so moved into the Phillips neighborhood
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.700]   and the North side and other parts of this area around the church.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.860]   The Metrodome was three blocks away.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.100]   We created pamphlets that were about baseball and Christianity, football and Christianity.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   We walked over there.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.500]   I remember walking over there and handing out these brochures as people walked into
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.220]   the Twins games when they were playing at the Metrodome and to the Vikings games.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.520]   We had personal evangelism training.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.780]   We sent out evangelistic teams to the malls on Tuesday night.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.900]   We invited campus outreach to come here because we so admired the strategy of a church-based
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:42.500]   campus ministry that sought to win people to Christ and then graft them into the local
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   church.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.260]   We did praise marches on big flat beds and pulled them through and had a thousand people
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.220]   marching through Phillips neighborhood singing, "Make way, make way."
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.660]   That was a song that was popular back in the 80s.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:03.380]   We did Wednesday night picnics in the park and public venues and we fed people and preached
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.540]   the gospel to them.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.000]   My answer, Tony, is yes, yes, yes.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.380]   There should be a never-ending stream of creativity in trying to help our people reach the lost.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.400]   But I'll end with just saying theological faithfulness and depth is essential.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.140]   Never diluting the gospel is essential.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:33.660]   Never eviscerating or dumbing down or making silly the corporate worship is essential.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.540]   And I want to stress that I don't think pastors should preach to unbelievers.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:45.460]   They should preach to the people of God Sunday after Sunday and always acknowledge the unbelievers,
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.140]   tell them you're glad they're there, tell them you're preaching to the people of God
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.420]   and rejoice that they can listen in on how great it is to be a Christian.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.860]   That's normal ways of doing Sunday morning.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.380]   So you don't have to structure the service for unbelievers.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:08.860]   They don't expect, when an unbeliever comes to church, they expect it to be weird.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.100]   And it should be weird.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.580]   I mean, if it's not weird, you know what I mean.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.780]   I mean, Paul doesn't want us to sound insane, so he doesn't like the idea of speaking in
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.500]   tongues in public.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:27.260]   But unbelievers expect things to be different as Christians go hard after God in worship
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.280]   to the living Christ.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.580]   So I think we should design our worship services for the people of God, not for unbelievers,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.260]   and I think we should encourage people to bring unbelieving friends in spite of all
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.620]   those other things we're doing.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:48.420]   This also, and the aim is to let them taste and see what it is for the people of God to
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:54.980]   meet God, to love God, to enjoy God, to revel in God, admire God, be satisfied in God.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.860]   That's what unbelievers need to see.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.100]   Incredible.
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.100]   That's helpful on all fronts, Pastor John, that emphasis on faithfulness to the message
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.660]   and trust in God's power and leading and flat-out pursuit of innovation.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.100]   It's not only evident in your ministry, but it's evident now in how Desiring God is led
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.900]   and envisioned by you.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.740]   So I'm very grateful for this perspective.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.020]   For more details about this podcast or to catch up on past episodes we have released
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.600]   or to subscribe to the audio feed, even send us a question of your own, go to our online
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.700]   home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.420]   Well we recently talked about why it's wise to have little ears in big church and encouragement
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.540]   for children to be part of the corporate gathering on Sundays.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.540]   So what about when the sermon content is not suitable for children?
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.620]   Should they stay in or should they go?
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.380]   We'll close out the week with that follow-up question on Friday.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.980]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   [END]
