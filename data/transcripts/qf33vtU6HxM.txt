[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900]   - This is a big week for us at Desiring God.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.720]   We will be hosting our national conference,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.380]   which begins Friday at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.300]   This will be our 12th national conference
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.900]   and it will be our final national conference.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380]   And I know a lot of listeners plan to be there
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.860]   in person this weekend.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.960]   It will also be a special conference for you, Pastor John,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.140]   because you'll be giving five of the sessions yourself.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.540]   You've never done that.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.940]   The whole point of this conference is to show
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.700]   how relevant the Bible is for daily life.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.580]   So Pastor John, what would you say to a listener,
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.980]   a man or a woman listening to this episode right now,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.900]   who says, if they're really honest about it,
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.420]   that the Bible doesn't seem very relevant
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540]   to their average day, to where they work,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.820]   to where they live?
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.660]   Why do I need to read the Bible every day?
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.280]   How would you answer that?
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.580]   - Well, one thing I know for sure
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.620]   in response to this question,
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220]   and another thing I don't know.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.260]   What I know is that the Bible is relevant
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260]   to this person's average day, where he lives and works.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.580]   Say why in just a minute.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.980]   And what I don't know is what his goals are
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.100]   in life and work.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.220]   And the reason that matters is that you can have goals
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.220]   at work or in life, which will put you so out of sync
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.980]   with the Bible that you find the Bible to be annoying
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.580]   or condemning or boring,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.180]   because all it's teaching is in a different direction
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.740]   from the direction you're going.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.860]   And I don't know where this question is coming from
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.620]   in terms of spiritual life or what the goals are.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.060]   So let me go back to my first question.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.220]   We'll circle around to the other one.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.140]   I know the Bible is relevant to this person's daily life.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.940]   He says he doesn't feel like it is.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.360]   I know it is.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.900]   And here's how I know.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.380]   The Bible says, "Whether you eat or drink
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100]   or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.420]   The Bible says, "Render service with a goodwill
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.260]   as to the Lord and not to man."
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.340]   So at work, is he rendering service to the Lord,
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.360]   not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.340]   he will receive back from the Lord.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.340]   So this person's life and job fits in the category
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.820]   of whatever he does and rendering service.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.260]   At least it ought to.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   "All of life is to be lived to the glory of God.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.340]   And only in the Bible can we not only learn how to do this,
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.060]   but find the spiritual power to do it."
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.060]   So I say again, I don't know if this person has that goal.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380]   If his passion is not to glorify God in his work
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.500]   and not to do it as to the Lord,
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.700]   then probably the Bible is gonna seem foreign, useless.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.740]   But here's some questions I would ask to test,
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.700]   have him test or her test the relevance of the Bible.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.780]   Are you ever tempted to grumble at work or complain?
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.220]   Well, Philippians 2:15 is relevant
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.140]   and shows a glorious way to live without grumbling.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.100]   Are you ever tempted to be greedy at work
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.340]   or to take something that's not yours?
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.660]   The Bible has lots to say about covetousness
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.180]   and greed and stealing and how to be so content in Christ,
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.460]   you're free at work to be generous.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.460]   Are you ever tempted to be worried or anxious at work?
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.060]   Everyone is.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.660]   And the Bible talks about this
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.380]   almost as much as it does anything.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.340]   The most common command in the Bible is fear not.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.180]   Anybody who has any fears at work, the Bible's relevant.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.300]   Are you ever tempted to brag at work or to boast
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.980]   or to draw attention to your self
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.780]   and your superiority in some area?
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.080]   The Bible's full of wisdom about pride and humility
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.360]   and the effect it has on relationships.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.540]   Are you ever tempted at work to be angry with anybody?
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540]   Do you deal with temper issues?
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.940]   Are there strained relationships
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.660]   because you're so frustrated with other people?
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.020]   The Bible deals over and over again with the issue of anger
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.460]   and goes a lot deeper in that issue
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.740]   than any psychology can today.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.340]   Are you ever tempted to cut corners at work,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.260]   not to do the whole work expected,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260]   like punch out early or come in late or work half-heartedly?
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.640]   The Bible is so relevant to the quality of our work.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.340]   Are you ever tempted sexually at work
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.660]   to lust or to be unfaithful?
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.380]   And the Bible's full of relevant materials,
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.600]   a robust view of sexuality that puts it all
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.960]   in a good perspective in a proper place.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.060]   Are you ever tempted to feel sorry for yourself at work,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.460]   to lick your own wounds because someone spoke evil of you
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.740]   or you got passed over for a promotion?
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.940]   And the Bible's shot through with dynamics of life
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.140]   that help us deal with self-pity.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.980]   Do you ever struggle with guilt at work,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.700]   feelings that just come over you that are a vague sense
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.380]   that you're not as good as you should be
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.860]   or maybe you really failed at something
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.700]   you should have succeeded at by your own standards?
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.300]   And there's no remedy except the ultimate remedy
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200]   given in the Bible for guilt.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.820]   Are there lost people at work that you care about?
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.300]   You don't want them to go to hell?
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.100]   Where are you gonna get help for dealing with them
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.620]   in the hope of giving them life except in the Bible?
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.960]   Where are you gonna get strength and courage and boldness
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.780]   and wisdom for how to deal with those people?
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.620]   So my answer is it is so obvious the Bible is relevant
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.420]   for this fellow's work and his life,
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.780]   but really it comes down to this.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.300]   Does he or she want to see
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.660]   the greatest treasure in the universe?
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.300]   Does he desire to know Jesus
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.600]   and enjoy Jesus more than anything?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.420]   Does he love people so much that he grieves over the fact
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.460]   that they don't know Jesus
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.760]   and will be lost forever without him?
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.260]   That's the question.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.180]   If Jesus is supreme in this person's life,
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.340]   if he's supreme, if the passion is to know him above all,
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.000]   if the passion is to desire him and enjoy him
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.460]   and treasure him more than anything,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.420]   if the passion is to bring as many people with you
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.620]   as you can into that experience,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.220]   then you can't live without the Bible.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's the most relevant book in the world.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.020]   - Yes, amen.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.460]   And we'll be back tomorrow to address another question
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.260]   that we get, and it's this.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.340]   If I go to church on Sundays and listen well
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.100]   to my pastor's faithful preaching,
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.980]   why do I need to labor to read and understand
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.900]   the Bible on my own?
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.780]   We'll hear Pastor John respond to that tomorrow.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.300]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.880]   (upbeat music)
