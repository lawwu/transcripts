[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Hello everybody it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.600]   talk about the Paycheck Protection Program again because I'm on record as
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.640]   saying it's the best economic rescue package I've ever seen. It's impactful,
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.080]   it's a lot of money and I think it's gonna make a big big difference as
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.000]   millions of small business owners get their PPP loans that will ultimately be
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400]   forgiven. Now I'm always trying to figure out and discuss what are some downside
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   risks because I do believe there's gonna be a recovery in the second half of this
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.320]   year and based on my previous podcast I did talk about buying the dip. I wasn't a
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   seller of the dip I was a buyer of the dip because I think things are gonna
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.160]   improve and they have so far but nothing is ever over and I'm always trying to
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.400]   make sure that okay what am I missing in terms of my investment thesis because
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.280]   the ultimate goal is to try to make money or outperform the markets. My
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.640]   ultimate goal is that continue to grow my net worth every single year in a
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.800]   risk-adjusted manner and I hope the same thing is for all of you. So regarding the
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   Paycheck Protection Program we know that it's now about six hundred sixty billion
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.440]   dollars. Initially it was three hundred forty nine billion and then they had the
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.080]   PPP package two so it's up to six hundred sixty billion dollars. We also
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.440]   know that successful loans are being distributed right now and if you get
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.040]   that money and you pay your people the same and you keep the same amount of
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.100]   employees the same for eight weeks after you get the money, theoretically the
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.520]   government has said they will forgive that entire loan. So it's like free money
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.160]   if you follow their rules. However I was talking to my wife the other day and we
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.120]   kind of got into a little bit of an argument because she was saying well I'm
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.440]   not so sure that those loans will be forgiven. So I had to go back and look at
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.920]   the post that I wrote on PPP and look at other articles and basically argue with
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000]   her and say well why wouldn't it be forgiven if they follow these rules
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.240]   unless the government is lying. What is the intention of the government to give
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.480]   this PPP money? The intention is to inject money into small businesses which
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920]   employ almost half the working population and to get people employed
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.520]   and stay employed or to get people hired back because small businesses can hire
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.560]   back employees within eight weeks or by June 30th and keep them at the same pay
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.240]   rate to get their PPP money forgiven after eight weeks. But what happened in
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.920]   this conversation with my wife is that she gave me doubt. She gave me doubt that
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   businesses might not spend their PPP money because they are unsure about
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.080]   whether the government would forgive these loans or not because really
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.280]   nothing is for certain until the money hits the bank and until the government
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000]   says okay you're good to go. There is never a hundred percent certainty in
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.600]   anything really in terms of investing, in terms of getting free money. There's
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.680]   always probabilities. You always want to think of probabilities. I think the
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360]   probability of getting the money, the PPP money forgiven if you follow all the
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.280]   rules which are clear but not crystal clear is about 95%. It's only a 5%
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.360]   probability that the government reneges on its promise. But that reneging of the
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.080]   promise is what makes me a little bit fearful. My initial thought was why
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.960]   wouldn't every single small business apply for the PPP loan? It's free money
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.240]   if you follow their rules. But as I got to thinking and talking to other small
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.840]   business owners it's just not the case. 55% of small businesses in the CNBC
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.280]   SurveyMonkey survey opted not to apply for PPP loans and 71% did not apply for
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.680]   an economic injury disaster loan. And what would the reason be for not
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.840]   applying for free money? Well I think it's many small business owners just
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.600]   didn't like the model and knew they could not abide by the rules to get the
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.280]   money forgiven. When I published my Paycheck Protection Program post I had a
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.120]   lot of back-and-forth discussions with very intelligent readers saying my
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.240]   calculations were wrong. You can't get more than $8,333
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   times 2.5 per employee for the PPP loan and so forth. I mean these were readers
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.640]   who are lawyers and bankers because there's so much confusion and even
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.920]   bankers that I talked to who were doing these PPP loans didn't know for sure. But
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.960]   the end result is you could get actually more than $8,333 per employee
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:50.680]   times 2.5 because 75% of the PPP loan goes to payroll and another 25% can go
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.320]   to something else. And the cap is $100,000 annual income per employee to do
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.680]   the PPP calculation. So yes I might have just lost you here but that's the point.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   It is a little bit confusing and even the smartest people that I know in the
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.800]   business don't even know exactly what's going on. So on the one hand, the bullish
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.960]   hand, more and more businesses are getting their PPP money. Now only
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.080]   supposedly 13% of the 45% of small businesses who applied for the PPP were
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.520]   approved as of early May. Among all respondents 7% already received
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.640]   financing and 18% are still waiting for a response from a lender. So this is not
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.680]   that encouraging of a number but if you look at the positive side that means a
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.960]   lot more businesses will get their money over the next 30 days and every single
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.040]   business that gets their money is gonna feel great. They're gonna feel like they
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.720]   won the lottery and they're gonna be able to retain or hire back employees
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.620]   that they lost during the lockdowns. This is incrementally positive and this is
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.200]   what the the stock market is assuming. Now on the negative side which is what
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.840]   I'm alluding to in this episode and the discussion I had with my wife is the
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.600]   confusion. The confusion already has eliminated about half the small
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.400]   business owners who did not even bother to apply for the PPP loan because they
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.480]   knew they wouldn't be able to follow the rules to get the loan forgiven. Now what
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.000]   about the half who did apply and they're gonna eventually get the money? I bet
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.540]   there is a good percentage of these small businesses who are gonna be too
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.400]   fearful. Too fearful of spending the PPP money because they're thinking about a
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.240]   scenario where they're thinking okay let's spend the PPP money on employees
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   and then 25% of the PPP money goes to rent and mortgage and whatever else to
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.000]   run the business. What if we spend that money let's say you get $100,000
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.120]   you spend the money and then eight weeks later the government's like okay let's
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   see how you spent the money. Did you follow instructions or not? And you think
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.000]   you followed instructions but the government said well you actually didn't
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.160]   follow the instructions so we're only gonna forgive 25% or 50% of your PPP loan.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.200]   Now the business might be thinking oh man we're kind of screwed we spent this
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.680]   money our revenues ticked up a little bit but not as much as we had hoped and
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.000]   now we have debt. We've got 75% of that PPP loan is that or 50% of the PPP loan
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.560]   is that or maybe we have a hundred percent of the PPP loan as debt because
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.640]   we didn't follow the instructions properly. So in that scenario you can see
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.480]   in a couple months right maybe in June or July probably July or August that
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.720]   some businesses might be in further trouble because not only did their
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.760]   revenue stay flattish or not rebound as much they actually have more debt. So I
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.000]   think a rational business would be very cautious in spending their PPP money.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.200]   They would set aside other money that equals or surpasses the PPP money to pay
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   back any kind of PPP money that's not forgiven. So you can see how at least a
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.840]   small percentage of businesses let's say 10% are gonna be continuously very
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   conservative after they get the PPP money and this is going to translate
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.920]   into disappointing earnings and under delivering on expectations and when you
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.400]   have disappointing earnings and under delivering on expectations which
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.280]   hopefully have been lowered over the past two months you're then gonna see a
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.320]   decline in the stock market because the stock market is basically a valuation on
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.960]   earnings and future earnings growth. So in conclusion I just want all listeners
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.000]   to be aware to watch out for things that are not going to happen as expected.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   We've experienced a fantastic rebound in the stock market and I think the
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.920]   expectations are very high now that things are gonna get much much better
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.040]   but like everything it's all about under promising and over delivering and it
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:12.160]   feels to me like the expectations are now too high for a strong recovery. So I
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.640]   personally am de-risking. I think the easy money in terms of the rebound money
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.560]   has been made in the stock market and I'm looking elsewhere for opportunity
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.600]   and I think that opportunity is in the real estate market because it lags on
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.880]   the way up and also lags on the way down. So I think there is opportunity if we go
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.240]   about and look aggressively and I'm going to talk about it in a future
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.160]   episode. Real estate is my favorite investment class to build long-term
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.360]   wealth and I want all of us to be vigilant in looking at scenarios in the
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.480]   next one or two months that could disappoint expectations. We know that
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.080]   PPP could disappoint expectations in terms of what the government and
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.400]   investors think on how small businesses will spend their money. We've just got to
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.240]   keep on looking at what else could disappoint expectations. I mean there's
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.320]   earnings growth for publicly listed companies that are coming out right now
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.200]   for the first quarter and there's guidance for second quarter and beyond.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.360]   Many companies are just not bothering to provide guidance and you know what maybe
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   I wouldn't too because it's so unpredictable what's going on. And there
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.520]   could be other disappointments in terms of unemployment benefits or maybe
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   there's expectations about a second or third ongoing stimulus check or
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.000]   universal basic income. You just have to be aware as an investor what the
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.760]   expectations are and what the reality is. So thanks so much everyone. Stay safe,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.020]   Stay vigilant, and if you like this podcast, I appreciate a positive review and share it around.
