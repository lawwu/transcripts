[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.860]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.180]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.340]   Today we're going to focus on the insight and the radical personal finance side of things,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.340]   the radical side of things, while we discuss Peter Thiel's $5 billion Roth IRA.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.600]   And I'm going to try to provide in today's show some insight into the recent article
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:40.720]   written about this Roth IRA so that you will see how Thiel allegedly has done this and
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.700]   how you can model what he has done in your own Roth IRA and in your own life.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.220]   In today's show, I will be referencing an article published at ProPublica.org.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.780]   The link is in today's show notes.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.940]   The article came out on Friday and it is called "Lord of the Roths, How Tech Mogul Peter Thiel
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.460]   Turned a Retirement Account for the Middle Class into a $5 Billion Tax-Free Piggy Bank."
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.060]   It's a phenomenal article and it is quite interesting as fodder for us to look at, analyze,
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.460]   and learn from.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500]   Now ProPublica is in the process of publishing a series of tax articles.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.180]   They have obtained a confidential data dump of IRS records from some of the wealthiest
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.400]   US American taxpayers and they are going through and analyzing that data and publishing articles
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700]   about what these people are spending their money on, how much they're making, what's
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.560]   happening to their assets, etc.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.340]   And while this particular article does not seem to lean heavily on that data, it's in
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.140]   the same line of things.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020]   And ProPublica is quite evidently advocating for changes in the system of taxation used
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.620]   in the United States of America.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.220]   They're quite obviously advocating for increased taxes on the people who are rich in the US.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.300]   And so that's obvious all through and through.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.420]   I'll spend a short time talking about that, but not a lot.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.500]   Because what's more interesting to me is to talk about what Teal has actually done and
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.420]   how you can do much the same thing.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.040]   Because when you get down to it, whenever you have access to information about how someone
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.740]   else has been phenomenally successful, you can basically choose one of two approaches.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.220]   Approach number one is to be mad at them for some reason about what they've done, why they've
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.880]   done it, and how unfair it is that they have done it.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.340]   Or you can say, "Let me learn from what they have done and see how I can apply the same
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.340]   principles to what I'm doing."
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.220]   And especially in things like this, where you have private information that you don't
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.460]   generally have access to.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.700]   If you'll just follow the clues, you can learn how to repeat, at least to some degree, what
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.460]   Teal has done with your own finances.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.060]   I'm going to be skipping around extensively in this article, skipping massive portions.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.660]   I would encourage you to read the whole article.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.660]   It's quite interesting.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.740]   I just need to respect, of course, their copyright and also respect your listening time.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.460]   Let's begin with the subheading.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.980]   Roth IRAs were intended to help average working Americans save, but IRS records show Teal
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.300]   and other ultra-wealthy investors have used them to amass vast, untaxed fortunes.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.980]   Let's pause for a moment.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.020]   One of the things that you'll see throughout this article is people simply recognizing
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.180]   that wealthy people are not second-class citizens to whom some special set of rules applies.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.100]   I find it so funny that in tax arguments, people always say, "Oh, there's a tax code
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.080]   for the rich and a tax code for the poor."
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.380]   My answer is, "Absolutely not.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.540]   There's one tax code and one set of tax rules."
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.460]   Now I do sometimes say there are two tax codes.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.960]   There's a personal tax code and a business tax code because that's true, and you want
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.560]   to use the business tax code as much as you can, but there is no different tax code that
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.460]   applies to somebody who makes $100,000 a year that doesn't apply to somebody who makes $100
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.060]   million a year.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.260]   There is no different tax code that applies to somebody with $10,000 of net wealth than
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.940]   to someone with $10 billion of net wealth.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.180]   They are exactly the same.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.500]   I point this out to you because you need to recognize that if you want to become wealthy,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.540]   you've got one tax code to use, but you will need to learn to use it in the way that a
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.540]   wealthy person uses it.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.140]   Again, what I find remarkable about this tax article and other tax articles that I have
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:13.960]   analyzed for you is there are virtually no allegations of impropriety.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.460]   This article, I say virtually none, because in this article intimates that perhaps Thiel's
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.340]   valuation of PayPal stock was too aggressive.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.200]   We'll get to that in a few minutes, but it doesn't say anything is illegal, and the idea
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.740]   that his valuation of PayPal stock was too aggressive, that's a matter to be settled
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.420]   between the IRS and Thiel, because again, as we'll discuss in a moment, this is a notoriously
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.900]   difficult area of finance to apply any kind of reasonable valuation to shares of a company
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.260]   that's not making much money, if money at all.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.180]   What you need to learn from this is that what Thiel did and what other ultra-wealthy investors
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:12.820]   do to allow them to amass vast untaxed fortunes is to read the rules of the tax code, and/or
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.060]   what's more accurate, pay people who read the rules of the tax code and then give them
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.300]   advice.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:32.440]   People who seek out good advice tend to make better decisions because they're fully informed.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.460]   An average person hears about something called a Roth IRA and does nothing about it.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.800]   An above average person hears about something called a Roth IRA, looks into it, and opens
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.840]   one but uses it in the traditional way.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.460]   They go buy a Vanguard stock market index fund, stick it in their Roth IRA.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:03.900]   A person who is genuinely committed to above average results hears about something called
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:11.080]   a Roth IRA, thinks about it, and considers how it could be useful for them and how they
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.140]   could arrange the circumstances of their life to use such an account.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.940]   And then they recognize that you would be crazy in most circumstances to put something
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.860]   like an index fund, which is exceedingly tax efficient, into a Roth IRA when you could
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:36.620]   put something in that has mega upside potential, like a private company, and is also highly
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:46.500]   taxed like shares in a large private company, and you put that asset into a Roth IRA.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.100]   Excellent people think about how they can manipulate their circumstances in order to
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:58.500]   take the best advantage of what they're doing, and thus they get above average results, or
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.060]   in Thiel's case, about a bazillion times above average results.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:12.540]   The fact that Congress decided to create an account to help average working Americans
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.140]   save is utterly meaningless.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:27.180]   The fact is they created a law, a set of rules, and any person who is bound by that law or
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:35.780]   those rules can choose to follow that law and those rules to their own benefit.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.960]   And smart people educate themselves about the laws and the rules and think about how
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.060]   they can use them for their own benefit.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:50.680]   Rich people are not second-class citizens who somehow don't have the same rights as
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   you and I.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.860]   This is what bothers me, because in the United States of America, where I sit right now,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:04.380]   in the United States of America, we're generating massive conflict in society.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:10.580]   We're pitting this group against that group, and one of the most popular groups to always
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.100]   pit people against is wealthy people.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.100]   Why is it popular?
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.420]   Well, because in any society, you will always have 20% of the people who own 80% of the
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.420]   wealth.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   So, by definition, if you can get people inflamed by political passions, and if you can remove
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:42.620]   from those people any sense of principledness, meaning what's yours is yours, rather, let's
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.740]   get them, go and get them, because they have more than me.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.980]   If you can eliminate that egalitarian sense of principle, that sense of ethic that treats
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.940]   each person as an individual being and says, "You can have what's yours if you've earned
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.620]   it fair and square, if you've followed the rules, et cetera," you can always get 80%
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.340]   of the people on your side against the 20%.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.660]   That's why populism is so effective.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.100]   And then you can narrow it down, right?
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:13.300]   Because the top 20% of the top 20%, meaning the top 4%, is always going to own 80% of
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.740]   the bottom 80% of the wealth.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.940]   So, you wind up with the top 4% owning, what is that, 64% of the wealth.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.660]   And then the top 20% of the top 20% of the top 20% will own the 80% of the 80% of the
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:33.940]   80% of the wealth, et cetera, until you get this disparity where you have 0.1% of the
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.740]   people who own 50% of the wealth.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.300]   That's how most societies work.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.700]   And so that's the normal distribution of wealth.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.500]   That's the normal distribution of income.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.900]   That's the normal distribution of peas in a garden.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.700]   And yet, if you will talk about that, you can get people on your side, and that's what's
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.940]   happening here.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.260]   ProPublica is fanning the flames of populism by going against Peter Thiel, even though
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.780]   Peter Thiel has done nothing wrong, at least that they've reported on.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.020]   Let's skip down to the core of the argument.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.860]   Over the last 20 years, Thiel has quietly turned his Roth IRA, a humdrum retirement
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.020]   vehicle intended to spur Americans to save for their golden years, into a gargantuan
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.220]   tax-exempt piggy bank, confidential internal revenue service data shows.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.940]   Using stock deals unavailable to most people, Thiel has taken a retirement account worth
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:34.300]   less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:43.780]   Now, does it matter what a politician intends in a law?
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.980]   Does it matter that politicians intended that a Roth IRA would be a humdrum retirement vehicle
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.540]   intended to spur Americans to save for their golden years?
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.180]   Doesn't matter what they intend.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.540]   What matters is what they write.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.300]   What matters is the text of the document that spells out the rules.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.980]   Now, either fortunately or unfortunately, I'm not sure, politicians are generally…
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:19.340]   I really want to say they're stupid, but they're not stupid.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.860]   Politicians are generally a bit myopic, in the sense that they don't understand what's
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:32.580]   likely to happen if they put in place a rule.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.980]   It's kind of like the best example is the classic cobra effect.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:45.460]   As the story goes, there was a town in India where there were a lot of cobras.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.060]   So somebody, a politician or a leader came in and said, "You know what?
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.900]   We've got way too many cobras here in this town.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.220]   We should pass a law to get rid of all of these dangerous cobras.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.860]   After all, there are too many cobras in the streets.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.740]   So what we'll do is we will incentivize people to kill the cobras and bring them to
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.020]   us so that we can get rid of the cobras in the streets."
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.860]   So the politician passes the law and the people start bringing in cobras.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.260]   But a few months later, there's just more and more cobras coming in all the time and
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.900]   they're trying to figure out, "How are these people getting…
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.900]   Where are they getting all these cobras?"
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.700]   And yet there's still tons of cobras out there.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:27.540]   Well, lo and behold, when the government incentivized the people to bring in cobras, people recognized,
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.300]   "I can make a little bit of money."
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.060]   And so they went ahead and they started breeding cobras.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.580]   And they started creating and manufacturing and breeding more cobras so that they could
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.180]   sell them and make more money.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.660]   Well, then of course, the politicians recognized, "Well, that didn't work.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.660]   We got to get rid of this.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.040]   So we're going to stop the program of paying for the cobras."
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.980]   So they stopped paying for the cobras, which meant that all the people with lots of cobras
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.300]   that they had bred were left with a house full of cobras.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   So what do they do?
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.820]   Well, they dumped the cobras outside and now you wind up on the other side with far more
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.500]   cobras than you ever had in the first place.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.540]   And this is often what happens with politicians.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.340]   They have the very best of intentions, but they have a God complex that says, "I can
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.740]   solve this."
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.620]   And so they create something, but then on the other side of it, the results are not
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.620]   quite what was anticipated, which is why any kind of positive action, especially that's
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.140]   not driven by the market, is often quite dangerous.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.860]   And then because you don't have a market system that can respond, rather you have a governmental
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:41.580]   system that's set in stone, you wind up with unanticipated results.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.100]   Using stock deals unavailable to most people, Thiel has taken a retirement account worth
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.100]   less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:59.780]   Now perhaps you, like me, look out for any way that you can figure out how to grow your
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.780]   money.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.460]   And when someone comes along and makes a statement, like someone has taken a retirement account
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.900]   worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall, your ears perk
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.860]   up and you say, "How on earth did they do that?
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.060]   And just how much of a rate of return is that?"
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.420]   So I did the math.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.780]   If you're interested, if you have a $5 billion future value and a $2,000 present value, you
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:28.260]   put in 22 years, 22 periods in between, with no additional payments and you solve for your
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:35.380]   rate of return, the answer is 95.35% annual rate of return.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:45.300]   If you can put $2,000 into an account, grow it at 95.35% every year for 22 years, you
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.340]   too can turn $2,000 into $5 billion, which is absolutely utterly remarkable.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:59.100]   To those who say you can't beat the market, you ought to identify what Peter Thiel did.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.100]   Now here's of course what he did.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.980]   Of course I used a little slight of word there, slight of mouth when I said you can't beat
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.980]   the market.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.740]   He invested in private company, which is why, forgive me, I suffer tremendous confirmation
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.500]   bias reading this article, but this is why I point out to you again and again and again
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.420]   that your best investments are generally going to be in things that you know and/or things
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.140]   that you're involved in.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.660]   How did Thiel get a 95% rate of return?
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:32.820]   Well, the answer is PayPal that he was involved in, Facebook that he was connected to, and
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:40.020]   his hedge fund that he built that was investing in things that he knew, and he made a tremendous
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.580]   growth rate in his portfolio.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:51.660]   Notice also, however, that he did this, this tremendous growth rate with a relatively small
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.660]   amount of money.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.300]   As we continue through the article, I'll go through the timeline with you.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.540]   What's most important about the timeline is simply that he could not repeat this today
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.220]   with a $5 billion portfolio because now he's got too much money that there aren't enough
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:11.460]   opportunities for him to continue this 95%, but he hit things just in this magically correct
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.460]   way.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.260]   They go on to talk about that the average Roth IRA is worth $39,108.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.980]   That's meaningless.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.700]   Whenever anyone uses the word average, by the way, you need to immediately ask yourself
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:32.460]   whether that's a mean calculation or a median calculation, and you never know, but you can
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.300]   have a, in that $39,000 number, it's probably a mean calculation.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.020]   You've got the guy with $2,000 that he stuck in years ago, and you got Peter Thiel with
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.660]   $5 billion, but we don't know if that's a mean number or a median number.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.980]   But it is spectacular, the opportunities that exist for him.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.980]   Here's what they say.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.820]   To put that into perspective, here's how much the average Roth was worth at the end of 2018,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.420]   $39,108.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.920]   And here's how much $5 billion is.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:09.940]   If every one of the 2.3 million people in Houston, Texas were to deposit $2,000 into
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.820]   a bank today, those accounts still wouldn't equal what Thiel has in his Roth IRA.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:21.080]   What's more, as long as Thiel waits to withdraw his money until April 2027, when he is six
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:31.500]   months shy of his 60th birthday, he will never have to pay a penny of tax on those billions.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.180]   ProPublica has obtained a trove of IRS tax return data on thousands of the country's
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.020]   wealthiest people covering more than 15 years.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.220]   This data provides, for the first time, an inside look at the financial lives of the
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.940]   richest Americans, those whose stratospheric fortunes put them among history's wealthiest
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.180]   individuals.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.260]   What this secret information reveals is that while most Americans are dutifully paying
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.180]   taxes, chipping in their part to fund the military, highways, and safety net programs,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.380]   the country's richest citizens are finding ways to sidestep the tax system.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.700]   Now here's what angers me, and forgive me, I'm going to let myself go for just a moment.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:15.440]   The average American is absolutely not dutifully paying taxes, chipping in his or her part
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:24.460]   to fund the military, highways, and safety net programs, if by that you mean not contributing
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.060]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.440]   Because the reality, as an experienced financial planner, is this.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.540]   The average American is dutifully putting as much money into his or her Roth IRA every
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:44.640]   year as he or she can, in addition to as much money into his or her 401k every year as he
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.740]   or she can.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:52.100]   Which is far worse, because every contribution dollar that goes into a 401k or a traditional
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:58.860]   IRA is a dollar that is completely free from any tax money that is being used to fund the
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.560]   military, highways, and safety net programs.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.620]   While every dollar that goes into a Roth IRA every single year is a dollar that has been
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.700]   taxed to contribute to the military, highways, and safety net programs.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:18.080]   So the statement is just flat out stupid on its face, because average Americans are the
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.200]   ones contributing to Roth IRAs.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.320]   Wealthy people cannot generally contribute to Roth IRAs because they make too much money.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.960]   They make more than the contribution limits, thus they cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.560]   The most they could hope to do is a so-called backdoor Roth IRA, and for the average wealthy
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.640]   person it's just not worth hassling with.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:48.000]   Unless you have the ability to make a massive rate of return by early stage startup investing,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.720]   something like that, it's just not worth hassling about, generally speaking.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.560]   Now to finish their sentence, the country's richest citizens are finding ways to sidestep
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.520]   the tax system.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.740]   Which is absolute baloney, because the country's richest citizens are finding ways to work
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:14.920]   within the tax system so that they can pay lower taxes.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.080]   Rich people generally do not evade their taxes.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.240]   It's poor people who make money in tips and side work and don't report the income who
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.520]   evade their taxes.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.440]   The country's richest citizens are simply trying to get good tax advice from professionals
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.920]   who will read the law and follow it.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.460]   One of the most surprising of these techniques involves the Roth IRA, which limits most people
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.620]   to contributing just $6,000 each year.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620]   Then they go on.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.620]   I'll just read it.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.620]   The late Senator William Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican, pushed through a law establishing
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:57.020]   the Roth IRA in 1997 to allow "hard-working middle-class Americans to stow money away
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.220]   tax-free for retirement."
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.140]   The Clinton administration didn't want to give a fat tax break to wealthy people who
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:10.300]   were likely to save anyway, so it blocked Americans making more than $110,000 per year
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.620]   from using them and capped annual contributions back then at $2,000.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:23.220]   Yet from the start, a small number of entrepreneurs, like Thiel, made an end run around the rules.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.220]   Listen to this.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.020]   Does this sound like an end run?
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.120]   Open a Roth with $2,000 or less.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   Get a sweetheart deal to buy a stake in a startup that has a good chance of one day
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.080]   exploding in value.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.360]   Pay just fractions of a penny per share, a price low enough to buy huge numbers of shares.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.000]   Watch as all the gains on that stock, no matter how giant, are shielded from taxes forever,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.180]   as long as the IRA remains untouched until age 59 ½.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:55.040]   Then use the proceeds still inside the Roth to make other investments.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.820]   Is there an end run around the rules?
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:07.200]   If there is one, it is exclusively this concept of their use of the word "sweetheart deal"
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.560]   to buy a stake in a startup.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.480]   The intimation with the term "sweetheart deal" is it's an inside deal.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's your ability to go in and say, "Hey, this is really worth millions of dollars,
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.280]   but we'll give it to you for mere thousands."
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.480]   Do sweetheart deals exist?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.760]   In my experience, probably not much.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.360]   What does exist is a community of people who talk about those deals, a community of people
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.480]   who are willing and ready to put money into those deals, who are actively investing in
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.360]   early stage businesses.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.680]   Many of us have been offered the true sweetheart deals.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.680]   I have.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.920]   You have a friend of yours that starts a company, is working day and night to try to do it,
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.200]   quits his job, trying to get this company going, says, "Man, I really need $40,000.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   What do you need it for?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.480]   I need it so I can pay my rent so I can keep building my company."
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.160]   That's the truth.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.880]   The guy who gives him a check for 40 grand in exchange for 300,000 shares of his company
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.400]   valued at half of a cent per share or a tenth of a ... whatever, I didn't do the math.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.040]   That's the guy who gets a sweetheart deal.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.800]   There's massive risk of failure with that.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.900]   This same organization, ProPublica, is the same kind of organization that will be quick
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.560]   to run articles about how businesses fail and how risky it is to start a business, etc.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.560]   It goes on.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560]   Let's continue.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   Next paragraph.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.040]   About a decade after the creation of the Roth, Congress made it even easier to turn the accounts
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.840]   into mammoth tax shelters.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.640]   It allowed everyone, including the very richest Americans, to take money they'd stowed in
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.420]   less favorable traditional retirement accounts and, after paying a one-time tax, shift them
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:01.100]   to a Roth where their money could grow unchecked by Uncle Sam, a Bermuda-style tax haven right
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.680]   here in the United States.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.760]   Why do you think Congress passed that law?
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.000]   Why do you think Congress made it easier for people with retirement accounts to pay the
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.800]   tax now and convert the accounts into Roths?
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.320]   The obvious answer is we don't know, unless you're in Congress and you were involved in
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.500]   talking to all the different Congress critters that you could.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.720]   We don't know.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.520]   I think Congress did that because they needed tax money.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.920]   They're looking down at these retirement accounts and they're saying, "These retirement accounts
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.120]   aren't going to be taxed for years down the road.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.200]   Our budgets are a mess.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   We need tax money.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.880]   If we allow people to go ahead and convert their accounts now and we take away the income
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.760]   limits, they'll pay us taxes now when we need it and we can always change the rules later
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.520]   and tax them down the road."
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.400]   That's why I think they've done it.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:01.760]   But wealthy people sit down and they try to figure out, "You know what?
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.080]   What could we apply for?
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.300]   What could we do?
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.400]   Should we pay the tax now or save it for later?"
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.480]   And they recognize, many of them, that the United States government is headed in a very
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.440]   bad direction fiscally and they say, "You know what?
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.120]   I think taxes are going to go up.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.880]   I'll go ahead and pay the tax now when I know the number because I think it'll probably
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.040]   be higher later and I don't know what that later number would be."
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.280]   So they pay the tax now.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.760]   Who's at fault?
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.920]   Congress changed the law.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:42.560]   Rich people just read it and followed it.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.800]   By the way, in the next paragraph we find a little bit of information about this series,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.440]   which is quite interesting.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:57.800]   I had not understood in the first article how much data ProPublica was given with the
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.080]   data dump from the IRS.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.520]   But early in the article you notice they said, "We had thousands of tax returns."
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.200]   Here, they say this, "To identify those who have amassed fortunes in retirement accounts,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.680]   ProPublica scoured the tax return data of the ultra-wealthy for IRA accounts valued
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.200]   at more than $20 million."
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   I don't know how many they have.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.000]   They go on to talk about Warren Buffett.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.880]   Sorry, Ted Weschler, a deputy of Buffett, has $264 million in his Roth.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.800]   Hedge fund manager Randall Smith has $252 million in his.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.720]   Buffett evidently has a Roth IRA with $20.2 million in it.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.400]   Robert Mercer, $31.5 million in it.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:42.000]   It's insane that they have this data, but they do and so we can have those numbers.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   I don't understand how it adds for them to put this data out of random people.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.400]   And now here I am repeating it on a podcast of how much money they have in their retirement
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.920]   accounts, but that's the path that they have chosen to take.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.520]   So let's talk about how he actually did this, which is the most interesting thing.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.200]   How did Thiel do it?
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.320]   Well, here's how.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:16.160]   Until in 1999, Thiel was running a small hedge fund and he was working at...
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.920]   Well, let me read it.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.720]   One day in early 1999, a deputy of Thiel's at the company that would become PayPal walked
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.600]   into the San Francisco office of Pensco Pension Services.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.560]   It could have been an uneventful appointment.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.120]   Instead, it changed Thiel's life.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.340]   Thiel, a Stanford Law graduate, ran a small hedge fund and hadn't yet joined the ranks
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.120]   of the ultra wealthy.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   But he had outsized ambitions for his months-old tech venture, where he served as both chairman
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.680]   and CEO.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.080]   He envisioned his company creating "a new world currency free from all government control."
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.560]   Influenced by libertarian Ayn Rand and Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, Thiel, then in his early
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.480]   30s, carried himself like a contrarian philosopher king.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.120]   A few years earlier, he had co-authored a Jeremy ad against multiculturalism that accused
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.560]   the administration of then-president Bill Clinton of waging class warfare.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.800]   Taxing the rich seems to have become an end in itself, he and his co-author wrote.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.880]   Pensco was a small firm that allowed its customers to put nearly any investment they wanted into
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.280]   a tax-advantaged retirement account.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.320]   Thiel was about to become Pensco's whale.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.120]   By the way, there's the intimation there that that's somehow illegal.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.480]   There's lots of companies that do it.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.000]   Illegally, you can put almost any investment that you want to into an IRA.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.240]   There are only a few prohibited investments, such as life insurance, personally owned property
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.200]   that you're actively using and benefiting from, and a couple others.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.800]   But outside of those, you can put almost any investment into an IRA.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.200]   In an interview with ProPublica, Pensco founder Tom Anderson recalled how Thiel and other
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.240]   PayPal executives had wanted to put startup shares of the company into traditional IRAs.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.880]   Anderson dangled something sweeter.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.520]   "I said, 'If you really think this is going to be big, you know, you might want
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.880]   to consider this new Roth,'" recalled Anderson, who is now retired.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.120]   "If the investment ballooned," he remembered saying, "you're not going to pay tax on
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.600]   it when you take it out.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.320]   It's a no-brainer."
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.640]   The math was compelling.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.360]   Thiel wouldn't get a tax break up front, but he'd avoid an immense tax bill later
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.320]   on if the investment surged in value.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.280]   They immediately grasped that, Anderson said, and they did it.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.160]   So once again, let's put this into context.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.680]   Here you have a group of smart business guys, hungry, aggressive smart business guys.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.760]   They want to change the world and they say, "We think we have an idea for how to do
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   it."
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.520]   So they're trying to figure out how do we profit from this?
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.720]   What do we do?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.880]   And the idea, of course, is, well, we want to save on taxes because the taxes are a major,
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.680]   major cost to us.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   So we have this IRA.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.600]   But look, Congress just passed a new tax incentive called a Roth IRA.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.920]   And the tax incentive that Congress has passed works like this.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.880]   If you put, if you earn money and you pay taxes now, and you can put some money, up
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.720]   to $2,000 in a year, into this account, and then by putting this amount of money into
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:27.000]   this account, you now have the ability to take the money out later, after age 59 and
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.920]   a half, tax free.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.080]   That's what they argued.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.920]   So you have somebody who reads what Congress says, goes and tells their clients, serving
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.480]   their clients, says, "Look, if you've got something that's going to blow up in value,
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.280]   this is what you should do."
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   And they grasped that.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.960]   Now listen, quote, "What happened next deprived the U.S. government of untold millions in
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:55.720]   tax revenue, perhaps billions."
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.680]   Thiel used his new Roth IRA to purchase shares of his startup.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.920]   In 1999, single taxpayers were only allowed to contribute to a Roth if they made less
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.520]   than $110,000.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.200]   Like many startups, PayPal offered its top executives low initial salaries and large
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.960]   stock grants.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:24.320]   Thiel's income that year was $73,263, the IRS records show.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:32.400]   Now is there anything wrong with a guy making $73,000?
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.000]   I don't know what he was making before that.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Of course, I don't have his tax records to know, but I'm not aware of him ever making
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   much money.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.640]   New Stanford Law graduate, making $73,000.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:48.280]   Is there anything wrong with a guy putting $2,000 into a Roth IRA?
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   Nothing at all, right?
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   Just following the rules.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.720]   Congress created this tax incentive.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.360]   After all, Congress creates this account because they want people to save for their golden
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   years.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.560]   Here's this guy who's a young, fresh college graduate, probably has a bunch of student
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.440]   loan debt or something, and he says, "I'm going to put some money aside for retirement."
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.400]   Nothing wrong.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.600]   Now what's the next paragraph?
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:15.880]   "Thiel also had an advantage over most Americans with IRAs, who typically used them to purchase
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:26.720]   publicly traded stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certificates of deposit."
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.320]   Since Thiel used his Roth to buy shares of a private company, the value wasn't set on
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.760]   a public stock exchange.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.720]   What this shows is that typical people are broke because typical people take the typical
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:48.140]   advice to invest in publicly traded stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certificates of deposit.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:55.720]   You would be crazy to put a lot of those things into a Roth IRA, unless you just didn't have
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:03.080]   anything better to put in a Roth IRA, because a lot of those things were already tax efficient.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.000]   Now you could put your bonds in a Roth IRA, you could put your mutual funds in a Roth
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.960]   IRA, but a lot of times stocks and whatnot are tax efficient already.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.560]   Their capital gains property.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.000]   What you look for whenever you have something is to say, "How can I maximize this?"
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.400]   That's what you should look for.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.880]   You should look for and say, "Okay, here's a set of rules.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.440]   How can I maximize these rules?
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.760]   How can I play these to my advantage?"
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:37.560]   The answer is you want to put in highly undervalued assets that could grow massively in value.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.040]   Some real estate investors will do this.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   There are a lot of real estate investors who have a lot of money in their IRAs, but you
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.300]   don't just go out and put a standard house in it.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.240]   You invest in something highly speculative because you can't get much money into the
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.960]   account because of the contribution limits, and you want something that's going to really
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.880]   win to maximize your tax-free deferral, your tax-free gains.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:06.480]   Now here's where we get into the idea of what ProPublica thinks Thiel may have done wrong.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.320]   Let me read what they say and then we'll talk about it.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.040]   Since Thiel used his Roth to buy shares of a private company, the value wasn't set on
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.080]   a public stock exchange.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.360]   Although the details of such purchases are not usually public, Thiel's financial assistant
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.520]   later disclosed them in a letter included in the Entrepreneur's Application for Residency
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   in New Zealand.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:32.000]   "Mr. Thiel purchased his founder's shares in PayPal through his Roth IRA during PayPal's
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   formation."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.520]   While SEC filings describing that time don't mention Thiel's Roth, they show that he bought
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.960]   his first slice of the company in January 1999.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:53.040]   Thiel paid $0.001 per share, yes, just a tenth of a penny, for 1.7 million shares.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.440]   At that price, he was able to buy a large stake for just $1,700.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.840]   In 1999, $2,000 was the maximum amount you could put into a Roth in a year.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:11.280]   Thiel's unusual stock purchase risked running afoul of rules designed to prevent IRAs from
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.680]   becoming illegal tax shelters.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.200]   Investors aren't allowed to buy assets for less than their true value through an IRA.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.680]   The practice is sometimes known as "stuffing" because it gets around the strict limits imposed
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.360]   by Congress on how much money can be put in a Roth.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.920]   PayPal later disclosed details about the early history of the company in an SEC filing before
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.640]   its initial public offering.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.760]   The filing reveals that Thiel's founder's shares were among those the company sold to
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.160]   employees at "below fair value."
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.840]   Victor Fleischer, a tax law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.640]   written about the valuation of founders' shares, read the PayPal filings at ProPublica's
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   request.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.280]   Buying startup shares at a discounted $0.001 price with a Roth, he asserts, would be indefensible.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.000]   "That's a huge scandal," Fleischer said, adding, "How greedy can you get?"
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.480]   Warren Baker, a Seattle tax attorney who specializes in IRAs, said he would advise clients who
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.000]   are top executives working at a startup not to purchase founders' shares with a Roth
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.320]   to avoid accusations by the IRS that they got a special deal and undervalued the shares.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.160]   Baker was speaking generally, not about Thiel.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.440]   "I would be concerned about the fact that you can't support the valuation number as
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.760]   being reasonable," he said.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.800]   And it goes on and it talks about how they had bought more shares and there was other
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.880]   people buying shares, etc.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.960]   Now the intimation, it's not an allegation, but the intimation here is that Thiel did
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:48.680]   something wrong by buying these shares in his Roth IRA at this discounted price.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.080]   And I don't know if he did or if he did not.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.560]   All I have here is the article with their two expert people that they interviewed.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:08.440]   What I do know is early stage companies, small companies, private companies are vanishingly
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.200]   difficult to value.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.520]   Pretty much you make it up, but you try to make it up in some way that makes sense.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.400]   I have a company, one of my companies.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:29.160]   This company is worthless, but I have one million shares in this company.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.320]   The company has no assets.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.020]   The business is not yet going.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.520]   It's worthless.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.720]   It's worth less than one-tenth of a dollar of a share.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.360]   And so the argument goes back and you have to say PayPal was actually worth a lot more
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   and everybody knew it.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:57.960]   Now without question, you could argue that successfully now because in hindsight, you
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   could argue that successfully if you say, well, Thiel thought the company was worth
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   a lot more than $0.001 per share.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.760]   Thiel thought the company was worth a lot more.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.320]   Without question, he did.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.880]   That was why he was excited about it.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.240]   That was why he was working in it.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   But here's what's so wacky.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.840]   The market may or may not have thought it was worth more.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.440]   Other investors had the opportunity to invest and they passed.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   We don't actually know what Thiel thought about it.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.480]   We don't actually know what it was worth.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.320]   It was worth as much as what someone was willing to pay and Thiel was willing to pay that price
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.520]   and the company thought it was worth it for them to sell that amount of shares to Thiel
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.800]   at that price because these people are committed to it.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.000]   Could there be a legal opinion here?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.920]   I'm sure there could be and they could fight it out in court.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.600]   So if Thiel is alleged to have done something wrong, the government could sue him.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   I can't remember what the rules would be at this point in terms of the statutes of limitations
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.560]   on the tax returns and everything like that.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.400]   I don't know how that would work out.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.800]   But the proper place for that is in a court.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.920]   In the court of public opinion, we don't have enough information to pass a judgment.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.320]   I'm very open to the idea that Thiel engaged in some kind of stuffing strategy, that he
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.800]   got a sweetheart deal.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.100]   That's very possible.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.600]   You and I would do exactly the same thing if we could.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.100]   I'm also very possible that Thiel saw something that he thought was good.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:41.200]   No court, no jury would ever find that he did anything wrong and it turns out that it
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   just worked out.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.360]   Probably with a lot of work for him and at the right time in the market.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:51.600]   There were probably a lot of other people who put shares of their small private companies
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.320]   into their Roth IRAs.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.760]   Their companies went bust in 1999, 2000, 2001 and they're worth nothing.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.340]   So it only works out if you're successful.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.680]   So it's possible that he did something.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   But having done this stuff for a long time, there is a wide range of defensible numbers
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.960]   that you put on things like valuations.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:21.720]   There is no law that says you can't use the thing that is the most advantageous for you.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:26.240]   You can't use, if the IRS gives you four different ways of valuation, you can work them through
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.200]   and then you can choose the one that's most advantageous for you.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.800]   So it would be my guess that a court case would actually find that nothing wrong was
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   done.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.920]   I don't know that, just guessing.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.960]   Because there's no reason to do something that's actually wrong in this situation.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.640]   There's no reason to do something that's actually illegal.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.920]   You're just simply choosing the thing that you think is going to be best for you.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.080]   Now I would defer to Mr. Fleischer, the tax law professor, and Mr. Baker, the Seattle
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   tax attorney.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.440]   They certainly have good points to say.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.720]   But I doubt that either of those men has Thiel's brain, in the sense that Thiel is somebody
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.320]   who is willing to take the risk.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.240]   You have one guy who's a legal professor at a university.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.760]   That means, I don't know anything about his career, I'm judging, I'm stereotyping, but
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.680]   generally he's not someone who would even understand the concept of risk, of entrepreneurial
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   risk.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.920]   He's looking for a safe government job.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.200]   And you get the other guy who's a tax lawyer.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.520]   Again, we don't know anything about him, but an entrepreneur would look at it differently.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.080]   If I were in Thiel's shoes, sitting at the table talking to a tax advisor, I would say
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.120]   to him, "Listen, I need to know what the law says."
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.180]   The advisor would say, "Well, here's what the law says.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.880]   You have to put them in at a fair market value."
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.720]   And then I would respond, and I would say, "Well, how do we know what a fair market value
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   is?"
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.160]   "Well, here's what we understand, here's what we know, here's what we don't know."
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   Okay.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.720]   Now, once that's done, I'm going to look at it and say, "What are the risks?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.680]   What are the risks of my not doing it?"
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.600]   Meaning, what are the risks if I choose this valuation versus the other valuation?
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.680]   And in these scenarios, the risk is basically that the transaction is disallowed and that
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   tax is imposed.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:22.600]   Well, if I'm following the law, right, there's no risk of my committing tax fraud, for which
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   there would be jail time.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.280]   I'm following the law.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.600]   I'm choosing a valuation estimate that is favorable to me, that's most favorable to
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.200]   me.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.280]   If I get sued about this, I have to defend it in tax court, and if I lose, what'll happen
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.240]   is I'll have to pay the tax.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.440]   But if I don't choose this, and I don't put the money in the shares of Maratha, I have
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   to pay the tax.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.400]   So there's just no reason for me not to take the risk as long as I would not be anywhere
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.720]   near the realm of fraud.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   That's the key.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.440]   You can't be anywhere near the realm of fraud.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.200]   You need to have records and data that says, "Here's what I think the company is worth.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.640]   Here's my argumentation for that.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.000]   So here are the number of shares that I want to have."
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.360]   That's my understanding of it as a non-attorney.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.080]   That's how we as human beings deal with risk.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.440]   You're dealing with risk at all times, and you're looking at it and you're saying, "I
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.720]   see something more in it."
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:31.880]   In every single financial transaction, every voluntary transaction, both people will walk
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:37.560]   away feeling like they got the better end of the deal, or they'll return the product
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   or be unhappy.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.640]   But in every happy transaction, which is the vast majority of them, both people feel like
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.840]   they walk away winning.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.600]   If you go to work today and you get a paycheck on Friday, at the end of the week on Friday,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:56.080]   you're going to walk away feeling like you got the better end of the deal versus your
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:03.000]   boss because you got a paycheck and your boss got 40 hours of your time.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.600]   On the other hand, your boss is going to go away feeling like he got the better end of
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:15.760]   the deal because he got 40 hours of your time and he only had to give you a paycheck.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.680]   Every transaction works that way.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:27.520]   In a scenario like Teal here and the company, Teal walked away from this transaction feeling
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.640]   like he got the better end of the deal.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.860]   And PayPal, the company, walked away feeling like they got the better end of the deal by
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.960]   selling him the shares that the valuation put there.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:44.600]   There's really no other way to figure out a valuation other than what two independent
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.200]   people arrive at in the marketplace without coercion.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.440]   We arrive at a deal and that deal is going to result in both of us walking away.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.200]   There's no more exact science than that.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.800]   You'll have one person walk up to a $50 steak and say, "This steak is a deal.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   I'm taking it."
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   You'll have another person that walks up and says, "I don't want it."
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.960]   The guy who's selling the $50 steak, the only way he figures out his price is based upon
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.840]   him going away feeling like he won.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.040]   I hope the point's clear.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.280]   I feel like I'm not communicating it well enough.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:19.700]   But in a free market scenario, the only way you can figure out a number on this is based
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.960]   upon the parties involved.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:27.720]   And the only tool that a tax authority can impose to say the number is fair or not fair
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:34.080]   is here's our approved methods of valuation and then what does the market say?
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.720]   So while I'm open to the idea that Thiel committed something wrong, I would say he certainly
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.040]   didn't commit fraud.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:49.860]   And if he did take a liberal valuation, he did what everyone else does when they value
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.080]   a company.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.440]   He did what everyone else does when they value a house for sale.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   He did what everyone else.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:59.120]   You look at the marketplace, you choose the number, and you say, "Here's how I got there.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.800]   I can argue this in front of a judge.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.640]   I'm ready to go."
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.360]   Now let's continue with the story and move faster.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.180]   After 1999, Thiel would never again contribute money to his Roth tax record show.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.180]   He didn't need to.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.560]   In just a year's time, the value of his Roth jumped from 1,660...
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   Excuse me.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.480]   Let me come back for a moment.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.640]   I want you to follow the numbers.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.200]   Thiel contributed $1,700 to buy the shares of PayPal.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:34.720]   Then the company goes through a round of valuation and they start selling funds to other investors,
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   etc.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.080]   That, in just a month's time, the company sold a slice of itself to investors for $500,000.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.640]   That June and August, another $4.5 million poured in from the venture fund arm of telecom
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.000]   giant Nokia and other investors, those records show.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.200]   The dot-com boom was in full swing.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   Going on.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   When it came time to...
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.480]   I should read it for fairness.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.600]   "We're definitely on to something big," Thiel told employees in late 1999, predicting that
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:04.280]   PayPal would become "the Microsoft of payments," according to The PayPal Wars, a book by a
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.760]   former employee recounting those heady early years.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.320]   But when it came time for Pensco, the custodian of Thiel's Roth, to report the value of the
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.680]   account at the close of 1999, none of the investor enthusiasm was apparent.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:25.160]   Pensco told the IRS that Thiel's Roth was worth just $1,664 at the end of 1999, tax
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.000]   records show.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.080]   In an interview, Anderson said Pensco relied on the companies whose shares were in a Roth
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.560]   to say what they were worth.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.960]   He didn't know how PayPal came up with its market value, but he said Thiel's purchase
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.040]   of those shares was "very legitimate."
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.160]   From then on, nothing would stop Thiel's Roth.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   In a Silicon Valley equivalent of Tolkien alchemy, his Roth would transform those PayPal
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.920]   shares into a tax-free fortune, one that would be safer than all the gems, gold, and
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.040]   silver in the Dragon Smogs Mountain.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.280]   Once again, we come to a situation, "All right, well how did the custodian do something
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   wrong?"
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.640]   In this case, I would say, "No, the custodian didn't do anything wrong."
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.960]   This is, as I understand, standard practice.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.360]   When you have a private company like this, even a private company that is engaging in
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:19.960]   early-stage financing, the valuation is completely made up out of thin air.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.280]   Every single one of those early investors thought the company was a multi-billion dollar
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   company.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.480]   That was why they were investing.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.200]   But on paper, their valuations are not multi-billions.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.520]   That's why they're investing early.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.360]   They're trying to get in early.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.320]   There's no public market for the shares.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:42.600]   There's no ability for you to see what the market is trading those things for.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.080]   There's just no way to know.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:51.000]   For every argument in favor of a certain valuation, there's an argument against.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Imagine it like this.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.120]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:50:04.080]   What do you believe is the proper value of Dogecoin today?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:12.520]   What do you personally believe is the proper value that should be placed on Dogecoin?
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.720]   The vast majority of people would say nothing.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.640]   It's worthless.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.120]   That's why the vast majority of people don't own the coin.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.720]   It's worthless.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.080]   But there are a whole lot of people that say it's worth a lot.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:32.400]   And then there are many, many more people that say, "I'm not sure.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   It's worth something."
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:42.120]   Now, Dogecoin is much easier for us to value than PayPal shares would have been in those
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   days because with Dogecoin, we have a public market.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.020]   With PayPal, and again, maybe I'm wrong on something because I didn't go through and
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:55.920]   read 18 books on PayPal like I would love to do before expressing my opinion publicly,
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.480]   but 80% chance I'm right.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.540]   Dogecoin is easier to value honestly than PayPal would have been in those days because
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:09.920]   you have an entirely made up artificial thing, just like a cryptocurrency, totally made up
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:15.320]   thing and you have an early stage of the world where the world is changing and nobody knows
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.680]   what's going to happen.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:23.400]   Plus, unlike Dogecoin, with PayPal, you have to input all kinds of risk of user error and
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   management error and people just messing everything up.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.400]   Dogecoin, you don't have that.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.680]   You just have a straight up commodity crypto that people can play around with and take
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.400]   bets on.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.960]   With PayPal, you don't have that.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.500]   You have a company that people can mess up and drive into bankruptcy.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.240]   So it's far riskier.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:48.280]   Now with 20 years of hindsight, it will look like the answer was guaranteed.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.560]   But if you think that, just tell me where you think Dogecoin is going to be 20 years
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   from now.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.280]   Then we'll go back in 20 years and listen to whether you were right or wrong, what the
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:01.680]   utility and the value of a Dogecoin is and measured in US dollars.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.760]   All of this is unknown.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.320]   By the way, we would also have to go back and do inflation calculations and all those
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:15.160]   numbers in the early PayPal calculations.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.280]   Now here's what's remarkable.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:26.440]   This is my favorite part of the story, of how Thiel used his Roth IRA to go from a fairly
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:33.400]   ordinary Roth IRA to an extraordinary Roth IRA.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:39.000]   First, after 1999, Thiel would never again contribute money to his Roth tax record show.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Why not by the way?
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.120]   Well, because he would have made too much money and he wouldn't have been able to.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.240]   If Thiel could have contributed money to his Roth, he would have.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.880]   But unfortunately, after that point in time, his company started to be successful and thus
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.400]   his income would have gone over the contribution limits and he would not be allowed to legally
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.480]   contribute money.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.520]   Until later, they changed the rules allowing for the backdoor Roth, but by then he would
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.200]   have had so much money in his Roth that it really didn't matter and an extra $5,000
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.040]   was immaterial.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.920]   After 1999, Thiel would never again contribute money to his Roth tax record show.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.080]   He didn't need to.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:18.600]   In just a year's time, the value of his Roth jumped from $1,664 to $3.8 million, a
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.440]   227,490% increase.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.960]   Joshua's commentary, amazing, absolutely staggering.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.480]   I want to point your attention to the fact that being involved in your own business,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:37.440]   especially a business that is scalable and has massive potential, is probably your highest
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.480]   opportunity for wealth, period.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:47.080]   The vast majority of people won't be able to do it, but for the few who can, that's
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:52.280]   where your biggest wealth is going to come from because the people who become wealthy
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.520]   are those who earn high incomes or who start businesses.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.000]   And if you're thoughtful and intelligent about the kind of business that you start and you
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.040]   choose something that at least has the potential for scalability, you can sometimes have dramatic
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.880]   results.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.880]   He didn't need to.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.960]   In just a year's time, the value of his Roth jumped from $1,664 to $3.8 million.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.520]   I don't know how that's valued, a 227,000% increase.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.260]   Then in 2002, eBay purchased PayPal.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.960]   That same year, Thiel sold the shares still inside his Roth, his financial assistant later
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.800]   told New Zealand officials.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.280]   The tax-free proceeds poured into his account.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:39.160]   By the end of 2002, Thiel's Roth was worth $28.5 million.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.960]   Tax records show.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.760]   If he had held his shares outside of the Roth in a normal investment account, Thiel would
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:51.240]   have owed the IRS 20% of his gains and owed another 9% to California tax authorities.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.040]   Because the shares were in a Roth, he had no tax bill when he sold them, saving him
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.600]   millions.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:04.080]   Suddenly, Thiel had an advantage few investors could claim, his own personal investment bank
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.640]   that wasn't subject to taxation.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:12.040]   He could now use the cash inside the Roth to buy and sell nearly any investment he wanted.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.920]   Thiel used the millions in proceeds from his PayPal windfall to invest in other Silicon
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.560]   Valley startups, as well as his own hedge fund, according to his financial assistant's
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   memo.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.880]   Once again, Thiel's Roth scooped up startup shares at bargain basement prices.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.760]   They go on, they talk about Palantir, his investment in Palantir.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.720]   In 2004, Thiel met Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard undergraduate.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:41.420]   Thiel invested $500,000, Facebook's first large outside infusion of cash.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:48.440]   Those Facebook shares ended up, where else, in Thiel's Roth IRA.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.520]   And he goes on and continues to grow.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.640]   Okay, so they talk more about the details.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:01.200]   So at this point in time, we see that it's just growing and from there, he's got so much
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.320]   value in there.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.920]   Now they do cover a section, which I'm going to skip for now.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.320]   They cover a section on the mega backdoor Roth, etc.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.880]   Talk about the Romney IRA and go on.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.240]   You should read it.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.120]   But we'll close this out with the last couple of paragraphs.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:25.680]   Having a modest 6% annual return and no withdrawals, his tax-free golden egg could be worth about
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:33.880]   $263 billion in 2087, when Thiel plans to celebrate his 120th birthday.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:39.280]   That's larger than the current gross domestic product of New Zealand, his adopted homeland.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.740]   There is good news and bad news, Thiel told the Washington Post when asked about living
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.080]   more than a century.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:48.060]   The bad news is, if you don't believe in the good news, you're not saving enough for retirement
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.000]   and likely to spend much of your old age in poverty.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.440]   The financial planning, Thiel said, takes on a very different character.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.700]   Now I love this because it talks about Thiel's stuff of life extension, which I think is
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:03.280]   really fun and interesting as well.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:10.080]   First of all, I hope that Thiel doesn't stop and start taking garbage 6% annual returns.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.280]   I hope that he continues to use his business acumen, his investment prowess, and I hope
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.400]   that his account is worth a lot bigger than $263 billion.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.400]   I hope he does.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:30.640]   However, it's going to create problems for us, you and me, who may or may not yet have
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.680]   $263 billion.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   Because it's hard to imagine a government like the United States sticking with its rules
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.360]   when somebody has been this successful.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.360]   And they will change the rules.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.120]   You always think about the Rinaldo rule in Italy, where they changed the entire tax code
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.600]   so that Rinaldo would come and play soccer there and they could have a maximum tax of
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   100,000 euros.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   It's hard.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.840]   I mean, a country will change everything if there's someone that's high profile enough.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.880]   And so there's no question this article is going to be influential around the world and
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:12.080]   influential in the US-American political and financial conversations.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.000]   So here are the points that I would like you to make sure that you notice.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:22.760]   Number one, notice that there's nothing that Thiel did that you and I couldn't choose to
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.820]   do.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:29.160]   You and I could choose to work in high-risk areas for our career.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.440]   You and I could choose to work in the market where the change is exciting.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:38.320]   If you go back to 1999, what you see at that time was that tech people in those days, they
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.320]   knew there was something new and fresh happening.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.800]   And there was opportunity all around because there was a fundamental transformation.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.240]   I see the same thing happening right now in the financial space with cryptocurrencies,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.320]   with DeFi, etc.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.520]   There's innovation happening.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.620]   There's change.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:59.300]   People smell the fact that we could change everything.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:04.760]   This entire system that has been around for centuries, we could change everything.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.920]   And if I were looking for opportunity, I'd look for where are things changing because
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.600]   where things are changing, there's opportunity.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.200]   There's opportunity to go and sell shovels to gold miners.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.880]   When you see a bunch of people going somewhere, pay clue into that and pay attention.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.560]   Thiel did that, right?
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.560]   In California at the right time, looking for opportunities.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.000]   There are opportunities for people who solve big problems.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.440]   Thiel solved a big problem.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.240]   He tackled a big problem, the transfer of money.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.000]   He had big dreams.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.680]   The fact that he was approaching those dreams with libertarian ideals doesn't mean that
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.200]   his dreams were any different.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.240]   It just means that he wanted to solve a big problem.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.560]   And he solved a big problem.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.880]   To this day, you and I use PayPal, right?
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   We use PayPal.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.600]   Even though there's lots of competition, we still use PayPal.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.960]   And PayPal transformed the marketplace in a powerful way.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.040]   So he was where the action was and he was willing to take the risk.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.200]   Now what is it that equipped him to take the risk?
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   I don't know.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.620]   I haven't read Thiel's book actually.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.280]   But I would say one of the things that equipped Thiel to take the risk was that he was able
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.280]   to do it.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.600]   And so maybe he came from a very wealthy family.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.040]   Maybe his parents paid for all of his college bills.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.920]   Maybe he had everything that he needed.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   I don't know.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   I actually don't know.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   Maybe he came from nothing.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.040]   Maybe he just kept his expenses low.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.120]   All that doesn't matter.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.360]   My answer is you've got to be prepared to take the risk.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.360]   So how do you do it?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.240]   Well, you become skilled and say, "I'm going for opportunity.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.360]   So can I be good at keeping my expenses low?
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.400]   Can I be good at going for where I can really build something big?
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:54.920]   Can I make sure that I set myself up in such a way that I can survive to go after something?"
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.880]   If you need $1,700 to pay a car payment so you don't get your car repossessed, that may
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.360]   be the $1,700 that you could have put into your Roth IRA to buy shares of the company
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.280]   that you're excited about.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.840]   So keep your expenses low.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.400]   Keep your flexibility high so you can go where the opportunity is.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.600]   Now along the way, take good advice.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.240]   Take good counsel.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.000]   Think and talk to people and take the advice of experts because if you talk to the experts,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.260]   the experts can help you to figure out how to do things smartly, to talk about how to
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.720]   structure things.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.900]   There are a lot of people in this listening audience who have started a company or been
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.140]   involved in a company and never went and sat down with a tax expert, never went and sat
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:39.740]   down with an IRA person and said, "Could I put this in my IRA?"
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.720]   Your first question should be, "Could I put my company in my IRA?
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.000]   After all, I don't want to leave the United States and move to Bermuda or to Dubai just
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.780]   so I can have zero tax.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.260]   Could I put my company in my IRA?"
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.760]   The answer is maybe yes, maybe no.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.740]   But you should ask the questions and be looking for those things as Thiel did.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.660]   So those are things that you can do.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.040]   Be involved in the inside.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.900]   Always try to find the community people who are involved in it.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.740]   In a couple of weeks, I'll be in Malta, ideally.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.740]   I'll be in Portugal.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.220]   I'll be in Malta in a couple of weeks.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.940]   I'm going there and looking into what's happening on the ground.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.860]   I want to know what's happening with the cryptocurrency space.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:25.280]   Now, it's less promised, seems less promising now than it did a few years ago, but the island
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.580]   of Malta in the Mediterranean was trying to position itself as the cryptocurrency island.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.740]   You should pay attention to things like that and say, "Where am I going?"
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.460]   Silicon Valley might work well for a lot of people, but I don't know that Silicon Valley
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.700]   is the place right now.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:43.100]   But I hopefully will be in Dubai later this year.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.580]   I think Dubai has a lot going for it.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.820]   If I were in the finance space, I'm much more interested in spending time in Dubai than
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:54.540]   I am in New York City at this point, although there's still plenty of opportunity in New
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.700]   York City.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.060]   So look for where you think opportunity is and put yourself in the way of it and then
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:04.380]   just be smart about what you're doing because you can model what Teal did.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.140]   You may not wind up with $5 billion in your Roth IRA.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.140]   You may not.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:17.980]   Which by the way, this 263 thing bothers me because like let me tell you why it bothers
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:18.980]   me.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.980]   I forget.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.980]   I interrupt myself just to do this.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   This bothers me so much.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:27.820]   It's the same thing like these worthless – they have these worthless – these completely
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:34.100]   and utterly worthless things about, "Well, if every person in Houston, Texas, all 2.3
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.140]   million people put $2,000 in a bank, it still wouldn't be worth $5 billion."
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   Okay.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.140]   What does that matter?
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.220]   Our human brain doesn't capture big numbers.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:47.000]   So here it says, "Assuming a modest 6% annual return and no withdrawals, his tax-free golden
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.700]   egg could be worth about $263 billion in 2087 when Teal plans to celebrate his 120th birthday."
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.700]   All right.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700]   So I have a new baby.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.300]   So let's say that I put in – I pay my baby to model for my business and I put in
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.100]   $2,000 into his Roth IRA.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.700]   By the way, I'm not saying new baby.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.540]   My baby is two years old now.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.940]   But I put $2,000 into his Roth IRA and let's assume that because of life extension, Teal
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.820]   thinks he's going to live to 120, but I think that by then we're going to live to
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.900]   180.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.180]   So if we start with 180 years and we just earned – I think 6% is a little bit too
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.780]   high but maybe he can only earn 5% on his investments.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:37.980]   Then in 180 years, then my son could have $13 million in 180 years.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.300]   By the way, it actually kind of disproves my point because it shows how spectacular
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   it is.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.300]   But you know what?
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.540]   I'm going to start my business and so he's going to start with – this year he's going
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.540]   to have a million dollars.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.540]   Give me better math.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.980]   He's going to put a million dollars in his account today and then in 180 years he'll
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.060]   have 6.5 – what is this, trillions?
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.740]   I can't read my numbers.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   So the point is that – what is $263 billion?
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.180]   It just doesn't know.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.380]   I'm not mad at them.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:07.220]   But the point is that these numbers – let's extrapolate out the national debt.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.780]   Let's extrapolate out the value of the dollar.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.780]   We don't know.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.860]   We're all guessing on the future.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   We don't have any idea on any of these things.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.460]   That wasn't quite the spectacular show ending that I anticipated.
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:26.240]   I just wanted to say to you that it's a remarkable article but you can do it too.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.320]   You can do this too.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.180]   You can use the exact same valuation rules that Thiel used.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.380]   You can go ahead and if you're wealthy, you can take a discount on a family – you
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.820]   can create a family business to move the shares of your business into.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:47.900]   You can discount them for being privately controlled and for having a non-liquid market.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:52.620]   You can then put those shares into an irrevocable trust held in a tax-free jurisdiction and
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.880]   those shares can grow over time completely tax-free.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.880]   You can do the same thing.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.440]   You can take the same discounts, etc.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.540]   You can use the world's financial systems to you.
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.100]   So use it.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.220]   I don't imagine there's anybody here who's going to get mad at Thiel for doing it.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   My point is you need to do the same things that Thiel did.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.620]   Why did Thiel become a New Zealand resident and later citizen?
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:17.100]   Because he saw the writing on the wall and he said, "I need to have some options."
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:22.960]   A guy like Thiel could always show up in New Zealand on an airplane but by having a citizenship
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.780]   in New Zealand, he puts himself in the position where he could renounce his US citizenship
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.700]   if he needed to or if he wanted to.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.940]   Now there's a good chance that he won't ever have to because he's been smart about
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.020]   putting his money in his Roth IRA.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:42.700]   By the way, if he renounced his US citizenship, his Roth IRA would still be his legally.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.940]   But think about how this works.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.860]   Why did he do citizenship planning?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:52.020]   Well, because if he ever needed to renounce his US citizenship, he controls the money
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.020]   in the accounts.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.020]   It's all self-directed.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.220]   So he controls the account.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.620]   If the US government changed the tax rules on him and all of a sudden tried to take $2
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:05.380]   billion of his $5 billion, he would renounce his citizenship and he would say, "I'm
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.980]   not giving you a dime."
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.500]   And what could the US government do?
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.820]   Well, they could come after him but he would put in place, especially now with this, he
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.020]   would put in place publicity.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.580]   He's followed every single rule that they put in place and they're the ones that change
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.580]   things.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:25.620]   Now could they hunt him down like they hunted down John McAfee who died this last week?
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.260]   Another story that I haven't covered yet.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.260]   They could hunt him down.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.260]   Right?
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.460]   But the point is that with a New Zealand citizenship, he has protection.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.860]   And in this case, Thiel has not broken any laws whereas McAfee clearly broke the law.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.700]   According to his own testimony, he broke the law.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.060]   Now the law, should it be changed?
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.060]   Doesn't matter.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.060]   Thiel hasn't broken the law.
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.580]   Thiel followed every single rule that the US government put in place.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:53.460]   And so he has citizenship insurance by being a New Zealand citizen.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.660]   If he needed to leave, he controls the full $5 billion in assets.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.700]   It's not situated in the United States or at least not most of it's not.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:07.100]   It's situated, his firm is controlling, so he has 92 sub-accounts now with his Roth IRA.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.100]   They control the assets all around the world.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.220]   He can retitle them if he needs to.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.860]   New Zealand doesn't have capital gains taxes in and of itself, so he won't have a tax problem
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.860]   in New Zealand.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   He solved his problem.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860]   Right?
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.060]   And you can do the same thing.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.140]   That's my point.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.460]   He solved his problems.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.540]   You can do the same thing too.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.740]   He followed the rules.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:29.060]   You can follow the rules and yet you can have above average results.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.900]   That's it for today's show.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.140]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.440]   I am still traveling this week.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.620]   Still picking some things.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.900]   Been family vacation, family reunion and whatnot with my family in the United States.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:44.180]   And so I haven't had some new stuff to launch to you yet.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.780]   Hopefully within the next few weeks I will be situated.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.460]   We'll be in Europe this summer and I'll be able to share some more things with you.
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.260]   I also apologize I haven't been able to schedule as many meetups as I want to do.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.420]   I just haven't been able to make it work.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.900]   But as soon as I can schedule more meetups and more events with you, I will do it.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.420]   Just reach the end of my capacity.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   Talk with you very soon.
