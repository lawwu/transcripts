[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,

[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's

[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.280]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.440]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.080]   Today, I'm talking to Jaspreet Singh, who I just met last month at a conference
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.400]   called FinCon, where he was one of the keynote speakers.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.840]   He's a first-generation American, a licensed attorney, and he's been an
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   entrepreneur his whole life.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   But in 2015, he decided he wanted to help others avoid the business and financial
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   mistakes he made.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.040]   So with zero subscribers, he posted his first video on YouTube about what he
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.600]   called the minority mindset.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   Well, it resonated deeply, and he's since turned the minority mindset into a full-on
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.480]   financial media company and YouTube channel with over a million subscribers.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.360]   In our conversation, we'll talk about what a minority mindset is and how you
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.440]   can have one yourself.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.800]   We'll hear some of the mistakes and learnings Jaspreet's had and his advice
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.000]   for getting through the tough early days of any entrepreneurial project.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.640]   And finally, some of his favorite financial tips and hacks.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.720]   So I hope you enjoy this interview with Jaspreet Singh.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.880]   investment decisions.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.480]   Jaspreet, thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.800]   Chris, that was an amazing introduction, man.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.360]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   So I'm just going to jump in and ask, how do you define the minority mindset?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.360]   The minority mindset is, is literally just a mindset.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.040]   It is the mindset of thinking differently than the majority of people.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.320]   It has nothing to do with the way you look, your ethnicity or your skin color.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.040]   And so for us now talking about that, we focus in on the financial side of the
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.000]   minority mindset.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   I mean, it's thinking differently than the majority of people when it comes to
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.400]   your money.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   Can you talk a little bit about what led you to start thinking this way and build
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.960]   an entire brand about it?
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.520]   Was it your background or how did you come to this?
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.080]   Yeah, I mean, I grew up in a very traditional Indian house where
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.600]   entrepreneurship, financial education, investing were all topics that I never
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080]   grew up learning about.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.760]   Not only did I not grow up learning about them, but they were actively
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.720]   discouraged in my house because, you know, like you said, my parents are
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.600]   immigrants and my dad came to this country with less than a hundred bucks.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.440]   He bust his butt worked every single day.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.920]   And for him, when he wanted me and my brother to become successful, the way
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.560]   that they did that in their mind was by having us become doctors.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.480]   So since I was a kid, I was always told that I needed to study hard in school so
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   I can become a doctor and anything that wasn't going to help me on my path of
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   becoming a doctor was a waste of time.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.080]   So even sports weren't that much encouraged when I was a kid, because why
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.800]   would you go out and play football when you could be studying to become a doctor
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.240]   and doing anything that wasn't really directly correlated with becoming a
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   doctor was a waste of time.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.320]   And so I always had this entrepreneurial bug.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.280]   I always thought differently.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   I always wanted to create value.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.760]   When I was a kid, I was mowing my neighbor's lawns.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.920]   I was delivering newspapers for my neighbors.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.480]   And then when I got into middle school, early high school, I started playing a
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.240]   drum called the dhol, an Indian drum at weddings.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   And I was also working on Auntie Anne's pretzels.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.920]   I was making like $5.85 an hour when I worked at Auntie Anne's pretzels,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.800]   because I was under 18, so they could play me below minimum wage.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.440]   And then when I started playing this drum at weddings, at first I was
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.480]   charging like $50, $60 an hour, but then I got a little bit better because I
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.000]   sucked when I first started, and then I would charge somewhere between $200 to
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.200]   $300 an hour, and now I'm like, wait, I got to work for two weeks at the pretzel
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.040]   shop to make $200 to $300, but I can make the same money in an hour at a wedding.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.600]   So things started to click.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   And so that's when I really started to think differently than the majority of
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.320]   people and my junior and senior year in high school, I started hosting teen
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.720]   parties for kids in my school because I knew a lot of the DJs, then the real
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.960]   shift happened when I went to college, because, you know, I didn't really have
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   any guidance on what college was like in America and what to expect in college.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.680]   I thought that everybody went to college to study and become super successful,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.000]   because if you study hard in college, you are guaranteed to become successful.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.560]   Well, I go to college and everybody around me is partying.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.760]   I thought you spent your Friday nights in the chemistry lab doing reactions.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.560]   And I got there and I could not believe that people were partying.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.760]   First off, none of you have any money because all y'all are here, the student
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.960]   loans, so you're blowing your student loans at these parties.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.120]   And I couldn't believe it.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.720]   So I was like, you know what, I never drank.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.240]   I never got into the party scene, like myself partying, but I was like, instead
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.400]   of me being like the majority of people and going to all these parties, how
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.120]   about I start hosting the parties?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.720]   I was knocking on every club and bar and restaurant at my college, asking
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.880]   them if I can host parties there.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.080]   And I don't have, you know, money to go and buy a venue or rent out a venue.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   So I would ask them to see if we could work something creative out where
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.920]   they wouldn't charge me anything.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.560]   They would get to keep all the revenue from the bar and then they would take
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.120]   like 50% of the cover that I charged.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.600]   And then I started learning about investing.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.680]   I started reading books.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.240]   I started diving into more of real estate investing.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.360]   When I was 19, I bought my first rental property.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   It was funny because it was the day after I took my MCAT, which is the
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.000]   test you take to get into medical school.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.240]   And the whole time that I was studying, anytime I took a break, I would go
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.200]   onto Yahoo finance and every article talked about how the real estate market
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.880]   is crashing, it's at rock bottom.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.640]   Cause this was after the 2008 crash.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.320]   And I knew nothing about real estate investing.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.600]   The books that I read said that every wealthy person invests in real estate.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.560]   And I knew I wanted to invest in real estate, but I had no one to ask how it
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.080]   worked or, or what the process was.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.440]   So like in my breaks of studying for the medical college admission test, I would
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.160]   look at properties online and go see some.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.360]   And I took my MCAT on August 22nd and August 23rd, I closed on my first property.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.800]   It was a 1000 square foot condo that the owners had originally bought for like
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.320]   $120,000 to $150,000, somewhere in that range, the crash happened.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.240]   The bank took it over.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.160]   Now the bank was selling this property for eight grand.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.400]   So I purchased it for $8,000, rented it out.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.960]   And that's where the whole shift really started.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   Wow.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   And at this point you said you were still taking your MCAT.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.720]   Did you still think at this time you were going to be a doctor?
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.960]   Yes.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.560]   And then no, it was through the MCAT.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.800]   I thought I was going to be a doctor.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   I was, I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.440]   I learned the word entrepreneurship when I was in college.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   And I, and I really related with that, but I'd never thought that I could not be a
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.200]   doctor because I felt like I was too deep into it.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.560]   And it's funny saying that now, because I was only 18, 19 years old, but I was like,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.000]   you know, I did all these volunteering hours in high school.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.560]   I did all this job shadowing where I shadowed a whole bunch of doctors.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.640]   I did these pre-med clubs.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.920]   I went to these conferences.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   I took all the pre-med classes, did the prereqs all the way into pre-med.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.040]   I don't know anything else.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.480]   So I have to become a doctor.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.800]   So I didn't know that I had other opportunities or options.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.520]   And it wasn't until after I got this property really taken care of and started
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   to rent out that I was like, you know, I like this.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.880]   I like the whole idea of financial education and entrepreneurship.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   This is what I want to do.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.480]   And then I also had this dilemma in my mind, because if you become a doctor, the
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.360]   way you make money is by treating patients.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.280]   And if I'm trying to just maximize the dollars that I can earn, I'm trying to see
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.680]   as many patients as possible.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.920]   So something just didn't make sense to me.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.600]   Like if you want to be a doctor, you should be a doctor because you love medicine.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.720]   But I felt like I was going down it for the wrong reasons because I felt like I was
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.160]   becoming a doctor because I wanted to make money and I could not be okay with that.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.760]   So that was when I made the decision that I don't want to be a doctor because I was
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   doing it for all the wrong reasons.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.920]   Wow.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.080]   So, so even though you might've had that minority mindset on your personal kind of
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.800]   college experience, starting parties and that kind of stuff, it was still there on
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.280]   the doctor until you crossed that threshold, which I think is something I thought about
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.800]   when I was preparing for this was it's easy to say, I want to think differently.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   I want to not be what everyone else is.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.880]   How do you hold yourself accountable to that?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.800]   Well, it really just goes down to what is your reason for doing whatever it is that
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.040]   you do?
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   What is your purpose?
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.600]   And for me, my purpose was really giving myself, my parents, my family, the things
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   that we never had.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.200]   My grandparents were refugees in India, the state of Punjab where we're from was
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.560]   severed in 1947.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.360]   When that happened, my grandparents were kicked out of their homes, lost their
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.120]   homes, their family members, their friends, they lost everything.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.000]   All they had was the clothes on their back and a sword in their hands.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.240]   And they had to literally now migrate to the new East side of India.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.160]   And if you did not, you were going to be killed.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.880]   And my grandfather saw his uncle get killed in front of them because they got
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.000]   attacked by a mob, came to a new country and had to hustle to make it work.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.920]   Then my parents came to this country with next to nothing.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.760]   And my grandparents came here and they helped raise me.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   So I was instilled with these cultural values of understanding the struggle that
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   my grandparents went through, seeing the struggle that my parents went through.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.640]   So I wanted to make sure that I could take care of them.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.320]   I always had that instilled in me, which was why I felt like I worked really hard
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.440]   in school. I wasn't always the best student, but I always wanted to do the
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.840]   right thing because I wanted to give back to my parents and my family.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:41.080]   And then the next thing was when I decided to be an entrepreneur, I lost all
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.440]   support. Everyone thought I was like lost my mind.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   My parents told me that I was stupid.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.560]   I was throwing everything away.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.920]   I had family members, uncles and aunts calling me saying, oh, are you sure you
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.200]   want to do this? You're throwing away the opportunity to become successful.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.600]   We have these community centers called Gurdwaras, our version of a temple.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.280]   I would go there and the people would be making fun of me like, oh, so you were
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.960]   going to be a doctor, but now you're doing these little businesses and stuff.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.280]   And it's like, you know, they were like just like poke jabs at you.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.520]   So that was like the next thing where I was like, you know what, screw you.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.040]   I'm going to prove everybody wrong because I want to be successful, not only
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.120]   to take care of my family, but now to show the world that, hey, that you can do
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.680]   what you love and be successful doing it if you understand how money works and if
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.080]   you are passionate about it.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.760]   So for me, it was knowing my purpose or, you know, they say don't do something out
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.000]   of spite, but this all started out of spite.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.400]   I wanted to prove everybody wrong because I was just so angry at how I got no
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.200]   support and how I never learned about money.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.960]   I mean, it just it angered me so much that when I started learning about
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   financial education and money that I had gone through so much schooling, but I
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.640]   didn't learn a thing about building wealth.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.480]   Wow.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   And how were you feeling during this kind of family is, you know, on top of you?
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.800]   How did you get through that?
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.160]   I mean, in terms of feelings, I've had a lot of anxiety at that time, and I'm not
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.120]   going to lie, because there was that feeling where I was not putting that much
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.960]   time as I could have been in school.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.400]   I went to law school when my parents found out that I wasn't going to be a
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.760]   doctor.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.480]   They're like, you have to at least become an attorney.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   And I settled with that.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.200]   I was like, that's okay, because at least with law school, I can go part time and I
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.920]   can build my businesses, the other part.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   So I was doing that.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:33.520]   And when I knew that I wasn't putting in my time into school to get a traditional
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.040]   job, I knew that I have to be able to support myself and that risk of me
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.520]   potentially failing used to keep me up at night, because I'm like, you know, what
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.440]   am I going to do if things don't work out?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.040]   What am I going to do if I can't make money?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   What if I do if my businesses fail?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.840]   What if I do if everything goes wrong?
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.120]   And I used to have a lot of anxiety, but to kind of counterbalance that I worked as
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.840]   much as I could.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   I mean, I worked my butt off when I was like in college, I was sleeping very, very
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.080]   little.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.880]   I used to joke that if I got four hours of sleep, that was a good night.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.640]   I'm not saying that you need to do that.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.320]   But it was just the only option that I had because I did my business in secret.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.720]   I was going to school all day.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.320]   I was studying.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.080]   Then I would run my business in the evenings and early mornings.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.120]   And then I have to host parties Thursday nights, Friday nights and be at the club or
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.280]   venue until 2 a.m.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   And then I got to sit there and make sure everything is good.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.320]   So I'd be there after 2 a.m.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.040]   until three, three thirty, get home by four, then start everything back up the next
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.440]   morning.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800]   So it's rough.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.920]   There's a lot of risk.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.960]   How do you kind of balance that you work your butt off?
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.800]   Wow, yeah, we've all been there, starting companies, doing projects.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.680]   It's a lot of work.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.400]   What advice do you have for someone who feels like they're stuck in that kind of
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.960]   traditional rat race where they're like, gosh, I've always assumed that I have to
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.080]   take this job and get this house and have this family and have these kids?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.000]   And is there any tactics for just jump starting or kicking off the thinking, as
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.480]   you say, as a minority mindset?
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.520]   Yeah, I mean, there's two aspects to that.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.360]   First is the mindset aspect.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.080]   And then you have the financial aspect on the mindset side of things.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.360]   Once you decide that, hey, I don't want to live like this anymore.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   You've got to figure out whatever it is that you want.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.680]   Do you want to start a business?
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.800]   Do you want to start investing?
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.520]   Or what is it that you want to do that is going to change your life?
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.360]   And you have to understand that, you know, you have to make that decision for
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.120]   yourself, that you want to change your life financially and you have to believe
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.880]   that it's possible for you and you have to be willing to do whatever it takes.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.960]   And you have to start learning.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.800]   I used to read books to learn.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.760]   Now you have so much education on YouTube or podcasts or wherever.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.600]   You can just start learning from people that have done what it is that you want
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   to do and really start shifting your mindset to understand that this is possible.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.840]   The next thing is the financial side, because the reason why so many people are
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   scared to make a change is because it's fear.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:59.880]   What happens if I start this business and it fails and now I lose my job and I can't
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.560]   get another job?
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   Now, how am I going to support my family?
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   And it's that fear.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.920]   But you're worried about the risk of you starting something new or doing
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.680]   something new.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.400]   But what about the risk if you don't start something new, then you're going to
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.200]   be stuck in that same position for the rest of your life.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   So there's a risk both ways.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.120]   One of them has more immediate risk.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.920]   One of them is more long-term risk.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   And so you got to understand that everything you do has risk.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.680]   But now, if you want to mitigate that risk of doing something different, whether
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.920]   it's investing or starting something of your own, the way you mitigate that risk
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.480]   is just building yourself a financial cushion.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.640]   And so that means cut out the crap when it comes to spending, build a savings
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.960]   cushion, build some extra reserves so that way now if things go wrong, you have
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.560]   some money to fall back on, buy some assets, build investments.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.840]   And now you can pick and choose.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.440]   Like I had a conversation with a buddy of mine.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.200]   He was like, OK, you know, if I have $50,000 right now, what do I do with it?
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.280]   And it's not such an easy question to answer because you have to
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.560]   understand where are you in life?
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.080]   Do you have a spouse?
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.680]   Do you have kids you got to take care of?
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.440]   Or are you young and you can take as much risk as possible?
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.920]   Because if you're young, you're 22 years old, you don't have any
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.080]   responsibilities, do the riskiest things possible that, you know, you believe
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.920]   in, that you think could have future returns, but you know, you can take a
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.600]   whole lot more risk when you're 22 than you can when you're 45.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.480]   Yep.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.200]   And so it's understanding where you are in life and then taking action to
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.160]   get out of that.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.400]   Two things that come to mind when I think about this.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.160]   One, when you start a company or start a project or like you did start a site on
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.080]   YouTube, you don't have to quit your job to do that, right?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.680]   There's a lot of ways to get started on the side.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.720]   I know you've talked a lot about how people should start stacking income
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   and building multiple streams.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.080]   So that's one.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.280]   And the other was, I was talking to someone who worked at one of these cushy
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.360]   six figure tech jobs and had an entrepreneurial bug and felt like they
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   really needed to quit to do it.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.240]   But I pointed out that if they weren't giving up their six figure job for their
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.920]   whole life, it doesn't take 10 years to find out if a business is going to be on
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.520]   a good track.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.480]   You can usually get a good sense in six months, nine months, sometimes even two
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.120]   or three months.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.280]   So I always tell people don't think about the cost of starting a business as not
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.800]   having your salary forever.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.920]   It's the cost of not having your salary for maybe six months, maybe nine months,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.360]   which for many people is really hard, which is why I really suggest starting
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.400]   things on the side.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.240]   But don't think about it as a forever thing, because it's an experiment that
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.000]   that you can usually get data on soon.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.400]   Yeah, started on the side and started with as little expenses as possible.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.600]   I mean, you talk about YouTube, it kills me when I hear people telling me that
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.720]   they're going to start a YouTube channel, and they just invested $5,000 in
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.960]   equipment, cameras, lighting, microphones, and you haven't even made a single
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.480]   video.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.760]   What the heck are you spending money on?
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.200]   Before you do that, start, hustle, be creative.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.680]   I mean, this, this is the trait that every successful entrepreneur has.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.200]   Because if you have too much money, then what do you do?
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.600]   You're going to spend it on dumb things before you realize where that money
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   needs to go.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.640]   And there's so many ways to be creative.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.120]   And it doesn't matter what the business is.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.280]   It doesn't have to be a YouTube channel or a content creation business.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.080]   You know, I've created products, I built a water resistant sock company.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.600]   And I spent very little money starting it because I don't have that much money.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   But I was creative.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.160]   I had to work with textile engineers and manufacturers.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.600]   And how do you do that when you don't have a lot of money to create products
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   and create technology?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.920]   Well, you get on the phone and you call a lot of people and you see how many of
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.000]   them are willing to work out creative deals, where they're willing to get paid
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.320]   after you start selling your product, or they're willing to do it in exchange for
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.640]   some sort of revenue share of your product, or they're willing to do
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.560]   something creative, where you don't have to front all the cash.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.800]   And it's that creativity, which really separates the successful entrepreneur
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.520]   from a wantrepreneur who's like, I need $100,000 to start a business because
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.320]   otherwise I can't.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.680]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.280]   You got to be able to find a way to make things happen.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.840]   And it's all about being creative, asking different questions and putting in the
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.000]   extra work to find somebody who's willing to work with you.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.080]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.880]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.000]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.960]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.000]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.200]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.600]   37,000.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.120]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.480]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.040]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.360]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   25.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.720]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.560]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.280]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.880]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.440]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.320]   system with one source of truth.

[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.520]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.400]   the companies I've run makes everything so much better.

[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.600]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.320]   is actually so good for you.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.080]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.960]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.040]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.480]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.360]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.600]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.080]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.320]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.080]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.960]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.240]   green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.040]   helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.000]   good and probably one of my favorite things to drink, and if you need another
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.680]   reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of polyphenols
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.640]   for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.560]   that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   world, but you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.120]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee, and for
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.160]   a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12 tea

[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.800]   them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.920]   And I'll go back to your YouTube example, because there's something I
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.840]   heard you say at FinCon was when you posted your first video, there weren't
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.720]   a lot of views, and I think that continued for your second, third, fourth
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.200]   video.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:38.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.320]   I even heard you say that a lot of the views in your early days were just you
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.760]   refreshing the page, but...
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.480]   I used to hit the refresh button a hundred times on all of my early videos
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.120]   because I used to post a video and nobody would watch it, so I was like,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.800]   well, I don't want to have a video with six views on it, so I used to go there,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.720]   watch the video, and hit refresh a hundred times on each video, that way it
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.760]   at least looks like I got three digits worth of views, a hundred views.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.040]   And so I know there's a lot of people listening who have some topic that
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.000]   they're passionate about.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.040]   It's the thing that, you know, people light up at the dinner table when
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.000]   they're talking about, and whether the medium is YouTube or Instagram or
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.200]   TikTok or anything, there's so many options, starting a blog.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.640]   When you get started, and I remember this myself, nobody's really listening
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.280]   at the beginning.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.880]   What did you say to yourself, or how did you commit to yourself to keep going,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.080]   knowing that that early part is so hard and feels like there's no traction, but
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.200]   clearly, you know, the message you had when you started and were getting no
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.760]   views, that message was about the minority mindset, and that's your brand
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:40.960]   now.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.360]   So that message resonated.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.880]   It just took a long time.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.800]   How did you push through that hard part where nobody was watching, but you
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.560]   thought what you were saying was interesting?
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.080]   I mean, this is where you have to be a little bit crazy.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   This is why they say all entrepreneurs are a little bit crazy, because you have
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.400]   to do it for more than just financial reward.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.120]   I did not start a YouTube channel to make money.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.880]   I started it because I wanted to spread this education on first how to launch a
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.440]   business without getting screwed over, which eventually transitioned into the
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.800]   financial education I wish I would have learned when I was getting started.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.440]   And so for me, it was more about the message of getting this information out
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.160]   there than it was about how much money can I make?
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.360]   Because we'll focus on YouTube, but this goes across any business idea.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.480]   If you start a YouTube channel for the purposes of making money and getting
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.400]   rich, you are going to fail.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.680]   Like it is so hard to build any sort of business, brand, channel for the
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.280]   sole purpose of making money.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   But if you're doing it with the passion and with purpose, because you love what
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.720]   you do, people are going to see that and they're going to believe you more.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   And they're going to listen to you because they're going to feel it.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.840]   The thing that makes YouTube so cool is it is controlled and watched by people
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.640]   because people can watch you and they'll say, this guy's not talking about good
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:57.960]   stuff.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.480]   I don't like this or, you know, I don't, whatever.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.560]   And they can leave because they feel like you just, you're just trying to make
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.280]   money off of them.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.680]   But if they feel you're passionate, they love what you're saying, that they will
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.240]   watch you.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.560]   And so it has to go down to what is it that you're doing it for?
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.400]   And for me, I mean, everything that I say, I can tell you this, I speak from my
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.360]   heart, everything I say I'm passionate about, the reason why I'm so passionate
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.160]   is because, you know, I'm confident about what I say, because I've lived through
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.800]   this, and I love what I do and what I talk about.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.240]   I mean, everything is coming straight from my heart, because this is important
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:30.640]   to me.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.480]   Yeah, well, that is a perfect segue.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.800]   So money, financial, everything that's important to you.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.560]   And and it's something I really want to dive into, because it's a topic I'm also
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.400]   really passionate about.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.080]   So as long as we're two money nerds, as I've seen you call yourself, and I know I
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.560]   call myself, how do you manage your own finances?
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.440]   What do you do that that is in the minority in terms of how you manage
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.680]   that's different from other people?
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:02.200]   Well, I, I don't work in minority mindset to make money, I work to buy
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.000]   assets.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.640]   And so the way that our income works, my income, if you want to look more on the
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:13.680]   business side is I follow what I call an 8020 rule, where if I make $10,000, me
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.440]   personally, for minority mindset, whether it's through ads or sponsors or
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.800]   whatever, 80% of that goes right back into the company.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:26.760]   And that will be used to now build software or, or expand on our website or
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.160]   hire more team members, we have an amazing team here of people that are way
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   smarter than I am, people who run our newsletter, our blog, our academy.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.840]   So you know, we have an amazing team of people that I'm now investing in there.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.320]   And then the other 20% that comes to me, most of that is now being invested into
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.680]   other assets, things like real estate, things like stocks, things like
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.560]   startups, and cryptocurrency and gold.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.200]   So, you know, I'm investing in a lot of different places.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.040]   And so that's the way I look at it is, you know, I'm not working for money, I'm
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.120]   working for assets.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.320]   And so for me, I save cash, because you know, you have to have cash for
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.880]   emergencies, I understand that.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.040]   But I also I want to own assets, I want to I want to own real estate, because
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.600]   real estate pays me with cash flow.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.000]   I love real estate, because I can revitalize properties.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   I'm an entrepreneur, I love buying distressed properties.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.120]   Because I want to be able to fix it up, I can make neighborhoods more lively, make
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.920]   it look better.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.600]   I love that aspect of it.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.720]   Plus, you can create that predictable cash flow, and you get tax breaks, real
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.200]   estate has some of the best legal tax breaks that our tax code has to offer.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   Second, I invest in the stock market, because I believe in the American
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.960]   economy.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.360]   Like I said, we know we have the strongest economy in the world.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.160]   So the stock market is a way for you to get exposure to the American economy.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.240]   Third, I invest in startups, because I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   I love entrepreneurship.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.920]   And I want to support entrepreneurs in as many ways that I can.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.360]   So I invest in startups.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.840]   Then I invest in cryptocurrency, because people are trying to take control over
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.480]   their own money.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.360]   This this this is a new movement literally being created by people from the bottom
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.640]   up.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.360]   And then I own gold.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.480]   Because in case I'm wrong about the economy, I invest in stocks because I
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.440]   believe in the economy.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.040]   If I'm wrong, I own gold.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.280]   It's not like a 20, 20, 20, 20, 20% spread.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.760]   Gold is my smallest.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.960]   That's my insurance.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.880]   Is this physical gold?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   Physical gold.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.360]   And so you know, you it's that diversification for me, because I can't
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.720]   predict the future.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.520]   I can't predict what's going to win.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.960]   But I can I can allocate my resources accordingly.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.680]   Yeah, I'm a fan of a similar diversification strategy.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   But one interesting thing I've heard you say, which is a little bit more minority
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.480]   mindset is that you don't think one job will be enough for most people.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.960]   And that you know, I read that as you don't just need to diversify where you put
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   your money, but you need to diversify where you get your money.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.800]   So I'm curious to hear why you think people will need, you know, multiple
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.040]   streams of income beyond just their job and what you think some of the best ways
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.920]   for people to get started to stack their income beyond their job.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:16.960]   So if we look a few decades ago, we used to live in an economy where households
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.240]   were supported by one income.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.960]   It was a man going to work.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.680]   And in most cases, the woman of the house did not go to work.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.800]   Not saying that's what's right.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.600]   This is just how it was.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.640]   And in that one income household case, that one income was able to support
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.760]   buying a home, buying a car and putting kids through school and vacations and
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.440]   retirement.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.640]   And it was enough to live.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.440]   Now we're in a generation where we have two income households.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.080]   I mean, it's dumb that we didn't have equality before, but you know, it's
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.640]   great that we're moving towards equality.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   But now you would assume that if we have two people working in a house,
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.600]   households should be twice as wealthy, right?
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.200]   Because people are making more money.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.760]   But that's not the case.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:10.720]   We have two income households, yet people are broker than ever.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.800]   Why?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.480]   Because one goes back to everything that we just talked about.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.680]   The cost of living has been skyrocketing relative to wages.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.640]   Part of that has to do with the fact that our dollar values have been
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.040]   diluted over the last hundred or so years.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.080]   And wages have gone up, but not relative to our cost of living.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.920]   In addition to that, we also have a higher standard of living.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.480]   You know, back in the day, you didn't have an iPhone and a MacBook and smart
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   watches and all these other fancy things that we have now that everybody wants
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.040]   to have.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.880]   Couple that with the growth of technology, which allows you to buy now, pay later.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:57.440]   And so this is the change in our spending culture, where prices of things are
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.680]   higher, we want more things, and we're financing our things.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.280]   And now you have two incomes that are struggling to support this.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.200]   Plus you have student loans, which are, interestingly, the biggest liability for
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.800]   young people, millennials, but it's also the biggest asset for the United States
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.440]   government.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.480]   So now if you want to be able to afford this life and build wealth, you're going
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.160]   to need more money.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.440]   And the way I look at it is, you know, saving is important.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.000]   When I say saving, I mean living below your means.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.480]   Living below your means is important where you have extra cash.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.800]   But there's only so much that you can cut.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.520]   There's only so many expenses that you can cut down.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.640]   And yeah, some people are going to be more aggressive than others.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.600]   But at the end of the day, if you're making $100,000 a year, there's only so
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.240]   much that you can cut.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.080]   Even if it's $30,000, there's only so much that you can cut, but there's no
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.400]   limit to how much you can earn.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.200]   And so this is the growth mindset of understanding, okay, yes, I need to live
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.920]   below my means.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:06.040]   I need to put some extra money aside for my pay down my credit card debt to start
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.800]   investing, to build wealth, to invest in my business, whatever it is.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.240]   But now I need to earn more money that way I can actually accelerate my path to
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:13.640]   wealth.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   And thanks to technology, it is more accessible than ever to be able to earn
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.480]   more income.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   I mean, you can drive for Uber, you can drive for Lyft, you can deliver
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   groceries for Amazon Fresh, you can deliver food for Grubhub, you can deliver
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.640]   food for Uber Eats.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.520]   Or if you want to be more involved with physical labor type of stuff, there are
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   apps out there that allow you to help people move.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.400]   You can lift heavy things, you can, if you have a truck, you can transport stuff
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.720]   in your truck, or you can come on to things like Upwork and Fiverr.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.280]   And now you can offer your services, your thinking, your skills, you can be a
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.080]   writer, you can be a graphic designer, you can be a video editor, you can be a
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.040]   voiceover artist.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   There's so many things that you can do, where if you have a skill, now you can
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.840]   market it.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.240]   And it has become so much more accessible because now you can go to one of these
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.080]   platforms, market your skill, and have somebody else who's looking for your
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   skill pay you in order to do that.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.320]   And these are things that you can do on your own time on your own schedule.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.680]   Like here at the Minority Mindset, we have our core team in the office.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.160]   And then we have like a couple dozen or so freelancers that work with us.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.000]   A dozen of them are writers, and they write on their own time on their own
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.680]   schedule.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.120]   And we send them topics, we give them deadlines, and then they can work their
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.000]   own job and write in the evenings or in the mornings or the lunch break or we
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.960]   know it doesn't matter to us when you write it as long as you get it to us by
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   the deadline.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.600]   And it's a win win.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.160]   Now they're providing you're providing value for the business or whoever you're
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.280]   you're working with.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.120]   And you get extra payment, you could do something that you love something that
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:52.760]   you enjoy.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.600]   And you can do this whenever you want.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:02.920]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.240]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.800]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.320]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.560]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.960]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.640]   for coffee.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.560]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade, sign up for a
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.640]   subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.080]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.560]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade, but
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.360]   this last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe, it's called bark the
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.240]   moon and it's so delicious.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.840]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription right now, trade is
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   offering a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.880]   When you visit all the hacks.com/trade, that's all the hacks.com/trade for a free
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.440]   bag with select subscription plans, all the hacks.com/trade.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.320]   Do you all remember episode 122, when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.480]   up your cooking at home?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.960]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.360]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.200]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.240]   cookware from any day, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.160]   them for this episode.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.520]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.960]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.520]   And honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.760]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.520]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.920]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.280]   too.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.520]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure, I highly
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.520]   recommend David Chang salmon rice.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.960]   It is so good.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.720]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection, they launched last
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.040]   year.

[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.920]   I want to switch gears a little bit.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.200]   So we talked a lot about earning money.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.600]   We talked about investing, but when I searched your YouTube channel, there were
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.720]   a ton of videos about hacks and a lot of them were money hacks and side hustle hacks
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.400]   and that kind of thing.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   One of the categories that we haven't spent much time on is spending less money.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.560]   What are some of your favorite tips or maybe contrarian minority mindset pieces of
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.320]   advice for people to look to save a little bit more money?
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.000]   So the interesting thing about this is there has to be a reason for why you are
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.320]   saving your money, because I grew up in a traditional Indian house and the Indian
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.880]   culture is a save first culture.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:24.040]   And I joke around about this, but Indian people make a dollar to spend 20 cents.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.680]   American people earn a dollar to spend two dollars.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.920]   And so Indian people are bred with this save first mentality where they want to
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.360]   save as much money as possible.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.920]   So the question first is, why are you living below your means?
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.800]   Because if it's just to save money, to save it, well, you know, there's better
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.560]   things that you can do.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.160]   So for me, it's really understanding why, because you have this debate in the
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   financial industry of people arguing over Starbucks.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.520]   Oh, my God, you spend four dollars on a latte.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.640]   Are you serious?
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.360]   If you compounded that four dollars at seven percent a year, do you know how much
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.040]   that would be worth?
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.480]   Now, people are arguing, is Starbucks a good or bad purchase?
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.120]   But but that's the wrong question.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.320]   The question is, why are you spending or not spending money at Starbucks?
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.760]   Because if you're not spending money at Starbucks just so you can save an extra
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.600]   four dollars, what is that going to do for you?
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.960]   But if you have a reason for not spending your money, because right now you're
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.480]   trying to build your business and you don't have any extra money because you're
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.080]   trying to invest every extra penny possible, you're trying to buy your first
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.640]   rental property. This is where you can start to ask the question of why am I
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:36.840]   cutting back? For me, I was always big on investing into me and my real estate and
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.280]   my business. And the first time I made one hundred thousand dollars a year, I
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.920]   was in school and I was a student and I was making good money.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.400]   You know, one hundred grand a year when you're a student is really good.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.720]   And you can show off a lot of nice things when you're in college with that type of
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.920]   money. But I lived in an apartment.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.560]   Where I was paying less than four hundred dollars a month, and that included my
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:05.320]   parking, my cable, my Internet, my heat and my electric, because I slept on the
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.200]   living room floor, I kept a mattress in the hallway and every night I would come
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.280]   there, drag the mattress into the living room, lay it down, put down my sheets, go
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.040]   to sleep, wake up, fold my sheets, put them away, lift up the mattress and put it
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.280]   back in the hallway. Now, I was making good money.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.360]   I could have afforded a much nicer apartment.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.000]   But the reason why I didn't do that was because I wanted to spend every penny
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.600]   possible and invest that right back into my business and to buy real estate.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.400]   And so you got to ask the question of why.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.080]   Now, when it comes to hacks, it's really just that discipline, man.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.800]   Like I used to guest teach in Detroit public schools and Detroit public schools.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:47.760]   For those of you who don't know, it is a rougher school district where these kids,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.280]   they grow up around a lot of rough things that the teachers have had a rough time
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.440]   teaching there. And it's just a rougher area.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.400]   So I wanted to volunteer and kind of help out.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.560]   I was guest speaking here and I would just talk about life, motivation, money
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.320]   management, a whole bunch of different things.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.480]   And I was talking to the kids at one of the classes.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.520]   I asked him how many of you all are working a job and a lot of them raised their
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.760]   hands. Then I asked him how many guys have a bank account and almost nobody raised
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.000]   their hands. So, you know, I got to talk to them.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.360]   I was like, you know, what do you all do with your money?
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.280]   So what would happen is these kids, high school kids would work at a job.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.680]   They would get a physical check.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.560]   Then they would walk into a liquor store or a convenience store, cash the check
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.960]   where they would pay one to 10 percent in fees to cash that check.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.800]   Then they will go out and buy chips, pop, soda, candy.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.480]   And on the way out, they'd only be left with half of their check.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.320]   And so this is where we need to change the way that we're using our money.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.080]   So I created what I call the rule of five.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.000]   And what that says is if you cannot buy five of them, you cannot afford one of
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.080]   them. So now we're talking about liabilities, things that you don't need to
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.920]   survive, where there's a big difference between being able to buy something and
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.280]   being able to afford something.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.400]   Because when I was talking to these kids, everyone said, you know, if I had a
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   hundred dollars in my bank account, I can afford a hundred dollar pair of shoes.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.000]   But that's not the case.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.200]   Just because you can buy a hundred dollar pair of shoes does not mean that you can
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.960]   afford it. Nowadays, if you want to buy a hundred dollar pair of shoes, you don't
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.040]   even need a hundred dollars.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.800]   All you need is a credit card or or access to these buy and I'll pay later
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.080]   platforms. But what you have to understand is there's a huge difference between
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.800]   being able to buy something and being able to afford something.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.400]   And now when we talk about using your money the right way, you have to know the
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.880]   difference. So I like to follow the rule of five.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.360]   You can't buy five of them.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.280]   You can't afford one of them. You want a hundred dollar pair of shoes.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.160]   You better be able to buy at least five of them before you can afford one of
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   them.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.560]   I love it. That's a great rule of thumb that I think I could probably find some
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.640]   purchases in my past history that that wouldn't have applied and and now
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   hopefully less.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.880]   You know, we've all been there. We've all been there, though.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.040]   When I was younger, I used to make a lot of dumb purchases.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.400]   It's that shift, right?
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.480]   You start to their mindset.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   When I was younger, I used to spend my money on a whole bunch of dumb things
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.120]   because that's what's normal.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   When I was in high school and I was making money, I wanted to look rich.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.880]   So the first time I had a gig that I did and I made a thousand dollars, I was
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.200]   like, oh, my God, I made a thousand dollars, a lot of money when you're in
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   high school. So I went out and I bought a thousand dollar watch, like literally
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.560]   spent all thousand dollars on one watch.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.440]   And it was like lined up with crystals all around.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.240]   It looks supposed to look like diamonds.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.400]   And it was just like super flashy and blingy just because I wanted to look
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.920]   rich. I mean, back then, it's like any time I made some extra cash, I upgraded
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.000]   my car. I was driving this Toyota and I put tints on my windows.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.480]   I upgraded the rims, put on some custom rims.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.680]   I put in two 12 inch subwoofers in the trunk.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.200]   I upgraded my sound system.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.880]   I put in HID lights.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.240]   I mean, I used to watch a lot of pit my ride in case you couldn't tell.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.080]   So I wanted to have the coolest car.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.960]   And I would, you know, quote unquote, invest money into my car to look rich.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.960]   But then when I started learning about money and I started understanding, OK, I
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.040]   want to become wealthy.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.880]   I like I want to be able to take care of my family.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   I want something better.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.960]   So, you know, you mix that that the mindset with the right financial education.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.440]   And all of a sudden my spending changed.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.160]   I stopped spending money on things because I wanted to buy assets.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.280]   And now it's like you want to buy as many assets as you can because you want to
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.720]   take care of yourself. You want to be able to live off your assets and then you
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.840]   want to take care of your family.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.880]   That way you never have to worry about money.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.200]   That way you can live your life and do whatever you want, because wealth
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.760]   ultimately is freedom.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.320]   And everything that we do is, you know, you want to have freedom to live your
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.400]   life and do whatever it is that you want, because when you have the freedom, it's
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.120]   much easier to to do things that you love and do the things that you want.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.640]   Yeah. Are there any things now that you think you spend money on that people
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.760]   would love to hear about?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   It doesn't have to be anything big.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.720]   When you have more money, it's nice to be able to afford luxury things.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.920]   And everybody likes that.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.120]   But it really starts with the small stuff, because I love working out.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.240]   I'm a gym guy and I have a gym bag that I keep with me.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.920]   And before, what I used to do is I used to have, you know, my deodorant, my
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.120]   toothbrush, my body wash, all my stuff.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.160]   I had one of each of these things and I kept it in my home.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.680]   Then I'd go to the gym every day.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.080]   I take these things from my bathroom, put it in my gym bag, walk over to the gym,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.440]   work out, shower, do all my stuff in the gym, use my toiletries, come home,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   take all this stuff out, put it back in my bathroom.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.840]   And it was a pain.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.960]   Then you start to make some money.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.160]   And then I was like, you know what?
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.640]   I'm going to make my life a little bit easier.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.400]   So then I bought a second deodorant, a second body wash, you know, a second
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.640]   beard comb.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.360]   And you start buying, you know, it's like it's convenience.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.120]   And now all of a sudden, when I go to the gym, I don't got to take it out of my
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.440]   bathroom. I just pick up my gym bag and I go.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.480]   And it's like, wow, I made it in life.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.440]   It's like it starts with the little things and you're able to buy more
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.720]   convenience. And this is where, you know,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.560]   money has the ability to buy convenience for you,
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.320]   but you got to pick and choose what it is that you want, you know?
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.120]   And for some people, it's going to be some things.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.200]   And for others, it's going to be other things.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.160]   I go to India pretty often because my family's in India.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:28.400]   And when we used to go to India, I sit in an economy class and, oh my God,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.520]   you're going to India in 18 hour flight, sitting in an economy class.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.560]   You're sitting like a sardine. You sit there. You can't move.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.360]   You got someone on your left. You got someone on your right.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.560]   You can't extend your legs. You got someone in front of you.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.960]   You can recline like three inches and you sit there and you wait for the,
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.960]   the flight attendant to serve you some food.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.440]   And then you can eat with your elbows to your shoulders and you're stuck.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.760]   And it is so uncomfortable. I mean, it's such a long flight.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.160]   And then when you walk in, it's funny that they do this,
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.120]   because when you walk in,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.240]   you're going to walk past the business class seats and these business class
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.280]   seats that are huge. And I used to always walk past. I'm like,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.320]   I wonder what these people do. How do you afford these seats?
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.440]   Cause it's like three to five times more to sit in business than it does in
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.640]   economy. I was like, how do these people afford this?
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.320]   Because their seats are like, you get your own cabin,
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.520]   you get your own like little compartment and your seat turns into a bed.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.600]   And you have this,
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.120]   this flight attendant that comes and serves you and talks to you and they call
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.600]   you sir and ma'am. And I was like, oh my God, that's so cool. And still,
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.320]   you know, in terms of luxuries, the first time I flew business to India,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.440]   oh my God, my life changed. I could not believe it.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.480]   I could not believe what it was like to sit in a seat like that for 18 hours.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.480]   I'm like, man, time flies. Life becomes more convenient.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.320]   That's amazing. Awesome. Well, this has been so fantastic.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.480]   I appreciate you sharing all these things. What are you working on right now?
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.560]   Where can people find it, man? You know,

[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.360]   I really appreciate you being here.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.560]   I'm a little sad we didn't end up talking about guacamole since I know that's a
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:38.720]   big thing for you. And I also share the passion, but oh man, I dig it.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   I dig it. Yeah, me too. Thanks for being here. Thank you, Chris.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.560]   This was a lot of fun.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:48.240]   That was great. If you watch any of Jaspreet's videos,
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.200]   you'll see how passionate he is about everything he does.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.840]   And speaking of videos,
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.160]   I've actually been recording most of the videos of these interviews,
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.520]   and I'm going to be putting them all up on YouTube.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.600]   So I'll share more when they're up there.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.440]   Also, thank you to everyone who's emailed questions, feedback, hacks,
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.520]   and so much more.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.880]   Please keep them coming for the next Q and A episode and especially keep sharing
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.760]   your favorite hacks,
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.560]   because I'm going to start including them in this soon to be relaunched weekly
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.560]   newsletter. Finally, thank you so much for listening.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.720]   You can find me at chris@allthehacks.com and I'll see you next week.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:39.440]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.960]   money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   retirement. It's called the personal finance podcast,
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.120]   and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money on
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.680]   the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.560]   It's hosted by my good friend,
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.520]   Andrew who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.000]   passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.920]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.640]   but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.440]   will blow your mind. And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.240]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.880]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.840]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.600]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.240]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:37.440]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify,
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.080]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
