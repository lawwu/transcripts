[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally

[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.240]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.960]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.080]   Today, I'm talking to Jaspreet Singh, who I just met last month at a conference
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.360]   called FinCon, where he was one of the keynote speakers.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.840]   He's a first-generation American, a licensed attorney, and he's been an
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   entrepreneur his whole life.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   But in 2015, he decided he wanted to help others avoid the business and financial
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.400]   mistakes he made.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.040]   So with zero subscribers, he posted his first video on YouTube about what he
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640]   called the minority mindset.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.600]   Well, it resonated deeply.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   And he since turned the minority mindset into a full-on financial media company
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.480]   and YouTube channel with over a million subscribers.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.280]   In our conversation, we'll talk about what a minority mindset is and how
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.440]   you can have one yourself.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   We'll hear some of the mistakes and learnings Jaspreet's had and his advice
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.000]   for getting through the tough early days of any entrepreneurial project.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.680]   And finally, some of his favorite financial tips and hacks.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.760]   So I hope you enjoy this interview with Jaspreet Singh.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.880]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.480]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.560]   Jaspreet, thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.880]   Chris, that was an amazing introduction, man.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.480]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.080]   So I'm just going to jump in and ask, how do you define the minority mindset?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.440]   The minority mindset is, is literally just a mindset.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.080]   It is the mindset of thinking differently than the majority of people.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   It has nothing to do with the way you look, your ethnicity or your skin color.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.120]   And so for us now talking about that, we focus in on the financial side of the
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.080]   minority mindset.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.840]   I mean, it's thinking differently than the majority of people when it comes to
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.440]   your money.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.800]   Can you talk a little bit about what led you to start thinking this way and build
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.040]   an entire brand about it?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.600]   Was it your background or how did you come to this?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.160]   Yeah, I mean, I grew up in a very traditional Indian house where
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.680]   entrepreneurship, financial education, investing were all topics that I never
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.120]   grew up learning about.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.880]   Not only did I not grow up learning about them, but they were actively
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.800]   discouraged in my house because, you know, like you said, my parents are
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.680]   immigrants and my dad came to this country with less than a hundred bucks.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   He bust his butt worked every single day.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.000]   And for him, when he wanted me and my brother to become successful, the way
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.640]   that they did that in their mind was by having us become doctors.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   So since I was a kid, I was always told that I needed to study hard in school so
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.480]   I can become a doctor and anything that wasn't going to help me on my path of
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   becoming a doctor was a waste of time.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.080]   So even sports weren't that much encouraged when I was a kid, because why
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.800]   would you go out and play football when you could be studying to become a doctor
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.240]   and doing anything that wasn't really directly correlated with becoming a
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.120]   doctor was a waste of time.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.360]   And so I always had this entrepreneurial bug.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.280]   I always thought differently.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.880]   I always wanted to create value.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.800]   When I was a kid, I was mowing my neighbor's lawns.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.920]   I was delivering newspapers for my neighbors.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.440]   And then when I got into middle school, early high school, I started playing a
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.240]   drum called the dhol, an Indian drum at weddings.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   And I was also working at Auntie Anne's Pretzels.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   I was making like $5.85 an hour when I worked at Auntie Anne's Pretzels because
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.840]   I was under 18 so they could pay me below minimum wage.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.040]   And then when I started playing this drum at weddings, at first I was charging like
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.120]   $50, $60 an hour, but then I got a little bit better because I sucked when I first
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.280]   started and then I would charge somewhere between $200 to $300 an hour.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.000]   And now I'm like, wait, I got to work for two weeks at the pretzel shop to make
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.960]   $200 to $300, but I can make the same money in an hour at a wedding.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.560]   So things started to click.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   And so that's when I really started to think differently than the majority of
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.280]   people and my junior and senior year in high school, I started hosting teen
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.560]   parties for kids in my school because I knew a lot of the DJs.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.440]   Then the real shift happened when I went to college because, you know, I didn't
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.400]   really have any guidance on what college was like in America and what to expect in
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.840]   college. I thought that everybody went to college to study and become super
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.280]   successful because if you study hard in college, you are guaranteed to become
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.080]   successful.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.280]   Well, I go to college and everybody around me is partying.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.160]   I thought you spent your Friday nights in the chemistry lab doing reactions.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.960]   And I got there and I could not believe that people were partying.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.160]   First off, none of you have any money because all y'all are here with student
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.400]   loans. So you're blowing your student loans at these parties.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.520]   And I couldn't believe it.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   So I was like, you know what, I never drank.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.840]   I never got into the party scene like myself partying.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.960]   But I was like, instead of me being like the majority of people and going to all
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.600]   these parties, how about I start hosting the parties?
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   I was knocking on every club and bar and restaurant at my college, asking if I can
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.120]   host parties there. And I don't have money to go and buy a venue or rent out a
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.320]   venue. So I would ask them to see if we could work something creative out where
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.400]   they wouldn't charge me anything.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   They would get to keep all the revenue from the bar.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.600]   And then they would take like 50 percent of the cover that I charged.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.040]   And then I started learning about investing.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.160]   I started reading books.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.760]   I started diving into more of real estate investing.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.120]   When I was 19, I bought my first rental property.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   It was funny because it was the day after I took my MCAT, which is the test you
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.160]   take to get into medical school.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.280]   And the whole time that I was studying, any time I took a break, I would go on to
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yahoo Finance and every article talked about how the real estate market is
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   crashing. It's at rock bottom because this was after the 2008 crash.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.000]   And I knew nothing about real estate investing.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.520]   The books that I read said that every wealthy person invests in real estate.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.040]   And I knew I wanted to invest in real estate, but I had no one to ask how it
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.920]   worked or what the process was.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.240]   So like in my breaks of studying for the medical college admission test, I would
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.040]   look at properties online and go see some.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.120]   And I took my MCAT on August 22nd.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.880]   On August 23rd, I closed on my first property.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.280]   It was a 1,000 square foot condo that the owners had originally bought for like
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.480]   $120,000 to $150,000, somewhere in that range.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.320]   The crash happened.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.240]   The bank took it over.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.920]   Now the bank was selling this property for $8,000.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.320]   So I purchased it for $8,000, rented it out, and that's where the whole shift
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.000]   really started.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.720]   Wow.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.120]   And at this point, you said you were still taking your MCAT.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.200]   Did you still think at this time you were going to be a doctor?
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.960]   Yes.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.080]   And then no.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.800]   It was-- through the MCAT, I thought I was going to be a doctor.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   I was-- I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.640]   I learned the word "entrepreneurship" when I was in college, and I really
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.200]   related with that.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.120]   But I never thought that I could not be a doctor because I felt like I was too
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.440]   deep into it.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   And it's funny saying that now because I was only 18, 19 years old.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.320]   But I was like, you know, I did all these volunteering hours in high school.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.880]   I did all this job shadowing where I shadowed a whole bunch of doctors.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   I did these pre-med clubs.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.920]   I went to these conferences.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.320]   I took all the pre-med classes.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.960]   I did the prereqs all the way in into pre-med.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.440]   I don't know anything else, so I have to become a doctor.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.520]   So I didn't know that I had other opportunities or options.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   And it wasn't until after I got this property really taken care of and
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.000]   started to rent out that I was like, you know, I like this.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   I like the whole idea of financial education and entrepreneurship.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.280]   This is what I want to do.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.400]   And then I also had this dilemma in my mind because if you become a doctor,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.760]   the way you make money is by treating patients.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.880]   And if I'm trying to just maximize the dollars that I can earn,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.760]   I'm trying to see as many patients as possible.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.360]   So something just didn't make sense to me.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.680]   If you want to be a doctor, you should be a doctor because you love medicine.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.560]   But I felt like I was going down it for the wrong reasons because I felt like I
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.480]   was becoming a doctor because I wanted to make money.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.840]   And I could not be okay with that.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.640]   So that was when I made the decision that I didn't want to be a doctor because I
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.680]   was doing it for all the wrong reasons.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.080]   - Wow, so even though you might have had that minority mindset on your
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.520]   personal kind of college experience, starting parties and that kind of stuff,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.280]   it was still there on the doctor until you crossed that threshold,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.800]   which I think is something I thought about when I was preparing for this was
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   it's easy to say I want to think differently.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.120]   I want to not be what everyone else is.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.000]   How do you hold yourself accountable to that?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.680]   - Well, it really just goes down to what is your reason for doing whatever it is
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.040]   that you do?
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.640]   What is your purpose?
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.120]   And for me, my purpose was really giving myself, my parents, my family,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   the things that we never had.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.160]   My grandparents were refugees in India.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.600]   The state of Punjab, where we're from, was severed in 1947.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.080]   When that happened, my grandparents were kicked out of their homes,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.600]   lost their homes, their family members, their friends.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.520]   They lost everything.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.320]   All they had was the clothes on their back and a sword in their hands.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.480]   And they had to literally now migrate to the new east side of India.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.200]   And if you did not, you were going to be killed.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.920]   And my grandfather saw his uncle get killed in front of him because they got
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.040]   attacked by a mob, came to a new country and had to hustle to make it work.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.440]   Then my parents came to this country with next to nothing.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.800]   And my grandparents came here and they helped raise me.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.040]   So I was instilled with these cultural values of understanding the struggle that
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.600]   my grandparents went through, seeing the struggle that my parents went through.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.680]   So I wanted to make sure that I could take care of them.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.320]   I always had that instilled in me, which was why I felt like I worked really hard
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   in school.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.800]   I wasn't always the best student, but I always wanted to do the right thing
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.720]   because I wanted to give back to my parents and my family.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.160]   And then the next thing was when I decided to be an entrepreneur,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.000]   I lost all support.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.480]   Everyone thought I was like, lost my mind.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.680]   My parents told me that I was stupid, I was throwing everything away.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.920]   I had family members, uncles and aunts calling me saying,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.840]   "Oh, are you sure you want to do this?
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.000]   You're throwing away the opportunity to become successful."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.200]   We have these community centers called Gurdwaras, our version of a temple.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.520]   I would go there and the people would be making fun of me like, "Oh, so you were going to
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   be a doctor, but now you're doing these little businesses and stuff."
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.720]   And it's like, you know, they were like, just like poke jabs at you.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.880]   So that was like the next thing where I was like, "You know what?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880]   Screw you.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.320]   I'm not going to prove everybody wrong because I want to be successful, not only to take
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.960]   care of my family, but now to show the world that, hey, that you can do what you love and
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.880]   be successful doing it if you understand how money works and if you are passionate about
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   it."
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.800]   So for me, it was knowing my purpose or, you know, they say don't do something out of spite,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.120]   but this all started out of spite.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.160]   I wanted to prove everybody wrong because I was just so angry at how I got no support
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.240]   and how I never learned about money.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   I mean, it just, it angered me so much that when I started learning about financial education
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.960]   and money that I had gone through so much schooling, but I didn't learn a thing about
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.520]   building wealth.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.040]   Wow.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.320]   And how were you feeling during this kind of family is, you know, on top of you?
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.880]   Like, how did you get through that?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.640]   I mean, in terms of feelings, I've had a lot of anxiety at that time, and I'm not going
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.840]   to lie, because there was that feeling where I was not putting that much time as I could
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.120]   have been in school.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.680]   I went to law school when my parents found out that I wasn't going to be a doctor.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.200]   They're like, "You have to at least become an attorney," and I settled with that.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.320]   I was like, "That's okay because at least with law school, I can go part-time and I
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.040]   can build my businesses," the other part.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   So I was doing that, and when I knew that I wasn't putting in my time into school to
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.840]   get a traditional job, I knew that I have to be able to support myself, and that risk
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.800]   of me potentially failing used to keep me up at night because I'm like, "What am I going
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.520]   to do if things don't work out?
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.120]   What am I going to do if I can't make money?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.520]   What if I do if my businesses fail?
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.720]   What if I do if everything goes wrong?"
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.280]   And I used to have a lot of anxiety, but to kind of counterbalance that, I worked as much
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   as I could.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.880]   I mean, I worked my butt off.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.560]   When I was in college, I was sleeping very, very little.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.340]   I used to joke that if I got four hours of sleep, that was a good night.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.660]   I'm not saying that you need to do that, but it was just the only option that I had because
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.560]   I did my business in secret.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.180]   I was going to school all day, I was studying, then I would run my business in the evenings
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.500]   and early mornings, and then I have to host parties Thursday nights, Friday nights, I'd
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.980]   be at the club or venue until 2 a.m., and then I got to sit there and make sure everything
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.980]   is good.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.540]   So I'd be there after 2 a.m. until 3, 3.30, get home by 4, then start everything back
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.500]   up the next morning.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.820]   So it's rough, there's a lot of risk.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.820]   How do you counterbalance that?
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.460]   You work your butt off.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.460]   Wow.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.420]   Yeah, we've all been there, starting companies, doing projects, it's a lot of work.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.700]   What advice do you have for someone who feels like they're stuck in that kind of traditional
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.020]   rat race where they're like, "Gosh, I've always assumed that I have to take this job and get
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.940]   this house and have this family and have these kids."
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.420]   Is there any tactics for just jumpstarting or kicking off the thinking, as you say, as
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.420]   a minority mindset?
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.620]   Yeah, I mean, there's two aspects to that.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.900]   First is the mindset aspect, and then you have the financial aspect.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.980]   On the mindset side of things, once you decide that, "Hey, I don't want to live like this
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   anymore," you've got to figure out whatever it is that you want.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.780]   Do you want to start a business?
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.140]   Do you want to start investing?
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.060]   What is it that you want to do that is going to change your life?
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.260]   You have to understand that you have to make that decision for yourself, that you want
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.580]   to change your life financially.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.300]   And you have to believe that it's possible for you, and you have to be willing to do
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.100]   whatever it takes, and you have to start learning.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.980]   I used to read books to learn.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.820]   Now, you have so much education on YouTube or podcasts or wherever.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.860]   You can just start learning from people that have done what it is that you want to do,
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.380]   and really start shifting your mindset to understand that this is possible.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.500]   The next thing is the financial side, because the reason why so many people are scared to
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.380]   make a change is because it's fear.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:59.860]   What happens if I start this business and it fails, and now I lose my job, and I can't
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.860]   get another job?
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.780]   Now, how am I going to support my family?
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.460]   And it's that fear, but you're worried about the risk of you starting something new or
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.460]   doing something new, but what about the risk if you don't start something new?
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.540]   Then you're going to be stuck in that same position for the rest of your life.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.700]   So there's a risk both ways.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.860]   One of them has more immediate risk.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.980]   One of them is more long-term risk, and so you got to understand that everything you
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.580]   do has risk.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.740]   But now, if you want to mitigate that risk of doing something different, whether it's
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.180]   investing or starting something of your own, the way you mitigate that risk is just building
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:43.040]   yourself a financial cushion, and so that means cut out the crap when it comes to spending.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.500]   Build a savings cushion.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.340]   Build some extra reserves so that way now if things go wrong, you have some money to
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.180]   fall back on.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.900]   Buy some assets, build investments, and now you can pick and choose.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.420]   I had a conversation with a buddy of mine.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.960]   He was like, "Okay, if I have $50,000 right now, what do I do with it?"
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.020]   It's not such an easy question to answer because you have to understand where are you in life?
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.020]   Do you have a spouse?
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.220]   Do you have kids you got to take care of?
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.660]   Or are you young and you can take as much risk as possible?
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.340]   Because if you're young, you're 22 years old, you don't have any responsibilities, do the
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.180]   riskiest things possible that you believe in, that you think could have future returns,
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.220]   but you can take a whole lot more risk when you're 22 than you can when you're 45.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.980]   And so it's understanding where you are in life and then taking action to get out of
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.980]   that.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.820]   Yeah, two things that come to mind when I think about this.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.020]   One, when you start a company or start a project or like you did, start a site on YouTube,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.260]   you don't have to quit your job to do that.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.020]   There's a lot of ways to get started on the side.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.380]   I know you've talked a lot about how people should start stacking income and building
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.380]   multiple streams.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.660]   So that's one.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.100]   And the other was I was talking to someone who worked at one of these cushy six-figure
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.620]   tech jobs and had an entrepreneurial bug and felt like they really needed to quit to do
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.620]   it.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.300]   But I pointed out that they weren't giving up their six-figure job for their whole life.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.960]   It doesn't take 10 years to find out if a business is going to be on a good track.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.640]   You can usually get a good sense in six months, nine months, sometimes even two or three months.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.560]   So I always tell people, don't think about the cost of starting a business as not having
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.040]   your salary forever.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.260]   It's the cost of not having your salary for maybe six months, maybe nine months, which
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.880]   for many people is really hard, which is why I really suggest starting things on the side.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.000]   But don't think about it as a forever thing because it's an experiment that you can usually
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.400]   get data on soon.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.560]   Yeah, start it on the side and start it with as little expenses as possible.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.360]   I mean, you talk about YouTube.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.160]   It kills me when I hear people telling me that they're going to start a YouTube channel
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   and they just invested $5,000 in equipment, cameras, lighting, microphones, and you haven't
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.120]   even made a single video.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.400]   What the heck are you spending money on?
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.440]   Before you do that, start, hustle, be creative.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.420]   I mean, this is the trait that every successful entrepreneur has because if you have too much
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   money, then what do you do?
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.420]   You're going to spend it on dumb things before you realize really that money needs to go.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.200]   And there's so many ways to be creative and it doesn't matter what the business is.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.920]   It doesn't have to be a YouTube channel or a content creation business.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.560]   You know, I've created products.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.600]   I built a water-resistant sock company and I spent very little money starting it because
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.240]   I don't have that much money, but I was creative.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.280]   I had to work with textile engineers and manufacturers.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.080]   And how do you do that when you don't have a lot of money to create products and create
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   technology?
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   Well, you get on the phone and you call a lot of people and you see how many of them
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.720]   are willing to work on creative deals where they're willing to get paid after you start
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.080]   selling your product, or they're willing to do it in exchange for some sort of revenue
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.160]   share of your product, or they're willing to do something creative where you don't have
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.480]   to front all the cash.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.600]   And it's that creativity which really separates a successful entrepreneur from a wantrepreneur
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.680]   who is like, "I need $100,000 to start a business because otherwise I can't."
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.120]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.240]   You got to be able to find a way to make things happen.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.160]   And it's all about being creative, asking different questions, and putting in the extra
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.400]   work to find somebody who's willing to work with you.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.840]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   I get it.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.400]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.440]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.520]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.320]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.080]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.860]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.700]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.860]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.680]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.280]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.160]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.200]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.360]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.280]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.600]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.420]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.440]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.400]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.440]   And I'll go back to your YouTube example, because there's something I heard you say
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.240]   at FinCon was when you posted your first video, there weren't a lot of views.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.200]   And I think that continued for your second, third, fourth video.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.520]   I even heard you say that a lot of the views in your early days were just you refreshing
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.160]   the page, but I used to hit the refresh button a hundred times on all of my early videos
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.560]   because I used to post a video and nobody would watch it.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.440]   So I was like, well, I don't want to have a video with six views on it.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.280]   So I used to go there, watch the video and hit refresh a hundred times on each video.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.060]   That way at least it looks like I got three digits worth of views, a hundred views.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.360]   And so I know there's a lot of people listening who have some topic that they're passionate
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   about.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.200]   It's the thing that, you know, people light up at the dinner table when they're talking
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.480]   about and whether the medium is YouTube or Instagram or TikTok or anything, there's so
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.680]   many options starting a blog.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.340]   When you get started, and I remember this myself, nobody's really listening at the beginning.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:36.360]   What did you say to yourself or how did you commit to yourself to keep going knowing that
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.320]   that early part is so hard and feels like there's no traction, but clearly, you know,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.960]   the message you had when you started and we're getting no views, that message was about the
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.860]   minority mindset and that's your brand now.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.300]   So that message resonated.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.320]   It just took a long time.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.240]   How did you push through that hard part where nobody was watching, but you thought what
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   you were saying was interesting?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.040]   I mean, this is where you have to be a little bit crazy.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.080]   This is why they say all entrepreneurs are a little bit crazy because you have to do
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.720]   it for more than just financial reward.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.120]   I did not start a YouTube channel to make money.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.920]   I started it because I wanted to spread this education on first how to launch a business
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.080]   without getting screwed over, which eventually transitioned into the financial education
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.040]   I wish I would have learned when I was getting started.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.960]   And so for me, it was more about the message of getting this information out there than
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.560]   it was about how much money can I make?
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.280]   Because we'll focus on YouTube, but this goes across any business idea.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.240]   If you start a YouTube channel for the purposes of making money and getting rich, you are
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.480]   going to fail.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.640]   It is so hard to build any sort of business, brand, channel for the sole purpose of making
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.080]   money.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.940]   But if you're doing it with the passion and with purpose because you love what you do,
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.120]   people are going to see that and they're going to believe you more and they're going to listen
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.880]   to you because they're going to feel it.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.160]   The thing that makes YouTube so cool is it is controlled and watched by people because
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   people can watch you and they'll say, "This guy's not talking about good stuff.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   I don't like this."
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.960]   Or I don't know, whatever, and they can leave because they feel like you're just trying
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.360]   to make money off of them.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.440]   But if they feel you're passionate, they love what you're saying, that they will watch you.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.080]   And so it has to go down to what is it that you're doing it for?
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.780]   And for me, I mean, everything that I say, I can tell you this, I speak from my heart.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.440]   Everything I say I'm passionate about, the reason why I'm so passionate is because I'm
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:32.960]   confident about what I say because I've lived through this and I love what I do and what
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   I talk about.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.800]   Everything is coming straight from my heart because this is important to me.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.280]   Well, this is a perfect segue.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.240]   So money, financial, everything, that's important to you and it's something I really want to
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.200]   dive into because it's a topic I'm also really passionate about.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.880]   So as long as we're two money nerds, as I've seen you call yourself and I know I call myself,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.360]   how do you manage your own finances?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.720]   What do you do that is in the minority in terms of how you manage that's different from
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.360]   other people?
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:08.200]   Well, I don't work in minority mindset to make money.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.280]   I work to buy assets.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.960]   And so the way that our income works, my income, if you want to look more on the business side
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   is I follow what I call an 80/20 rule, where if I make $10,000, me personally from minority
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.840]   mindset, whether it's through ads or sponsors or whatever, 80% of that goes right back into
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   the company.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   And that will be used to now build software or expand on our website or hire more team
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   members.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.480]   We have an amazing team here of people that are way smarter than I am, people who run
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.400]   our newsletter, our blog, our academy.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.960]   So we have an amazing team of people that I'm now investing in there.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:54.120]   And then the other 20% that comes to me, most of that is now being invested into other assets,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.680]   things like real estate, things like stocks, things like startups, and cryptocurrency and
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.800]   gold.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.080]   So I'm investing in a lot of different places.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.000]   And so that's the way I look at it is, I'm not working for money, I'm working for assets.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.640]   And so for me, I save cash because you have to have cash for emergencies.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.400]   I understand that.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.640]   But I also I want to own assets, I want to own real estate because real estate pays me
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   with cash flow.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.720]   I love real estate because I can revitalize properties.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.560]   I love buying distressed properties, because I want to be able to fix it up.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.680]   I can make neighborhoods more lively, make it look better.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.440]   I love that aspect of it.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.400]   Plus, you can create that predictable cash flow, and you get tax breaks.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.080]   Real estate has some of the best legal tax breaks that our tax code has to offer.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.840]   Second, I invest in the stock market because I believe in the American economy.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.160]   Like I said, we know we have the strongest economy in the world.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   So the stock market is a way for you to get exposure to the American economy.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.280]   Third, I invest in startups because I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.720]   I love entrepreneurship and I want to support entrepreneurs in as many ways that I can.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.000]   So I invest in startups.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Then I invest in cryptocurrency because people are trying to take control over their own
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   money.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.960]   This is a new movement literally being created by people from the bottom up.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:22.120]   And then I own gold because in case I'm wrong about the economy, I invest in stocks because
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   I believe in the economy.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.160]   If I'm wrong, I own gold.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.520]   It's not like a 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 percent spread.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.740]   Gold is my smallest.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.440]   That's my insurance.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.260]   Is this physical gold?
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.260]   Physical gold.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.560]   And so, you know, it's that diversification for me because I can't predict the future.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.440]   I can't predict what's going to win, but I can, I can allocate my resources accordingly.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.720]   I'm a fan of a similar diversification strategy.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.920]   But one interesting thing I've heard you say, which is a little bit more minority mindset
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.440]   is that you don't think one job will be enough for most people.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.800]   And that, you know, I read that as you don't just need to diversify where you put your
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   money, but you need to diversify where you get your money.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   So I'm curious to hear why you think people will need, you know, multiple streams of income
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.680]   beyond just their job and what you think some of the best ways for people to get started
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.560]   to stack their income beyond their job.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:25.240]   So if we look a few decades ago, we used to live in an economy where households were supported
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.120]   by one income.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.800]   It was a man going to work and in most cases, the woman of the house did not go to work.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   Not saying that's what's right.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.520]   This is just how it was.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:43.880]   And in that one income household case, that one income was able to support buying a home,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.320]   buying a car and putting kids through school and vacations and retirement.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.200]   And it was, it was enough to live.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.080]   Now we're in a generation where we have two income households.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.200]   I mean, it's dumb that we didn't have a quality before, but you know, it's great that we're
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.440]   moving towards equality.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.360]   But now you would assume that if we have two people working in a house, households should
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.620]   be twice as wealthy, right?
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.040]   Because people are making more money, but that's not the case.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.960]   We have two income households, yet people are broker than ever.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.040]   Why?
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.320]   Because one goes back to everything that we just talked about.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.840]   The cost of living has been skyrocketing relative to wages.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.000]   Part of that has to do with the fact that our dollar values have been diluted over the
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.360]   last hundred or so years.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.600]   And wages have gone up, but not relative to our cost of living.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.280]   In addition to that, we also have a higher standard of living.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.840]   You know, back in the day, you didn't have an iPhone and a MacBook and smartwatches and
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   all these other fancy things that we have now that everybody wants to have.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.280]   Couple that with the growth of technology, which allows you to buy now, pay later.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   And so this is the change in our spending culture, where prices of things are higher.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.760]   We want more things, and we're financing our things.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.440]   And now you have two incomes that are struggling to support this.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.920]   Plus you have student loans, which are, interestingly, the biggest liability for young people, millennials,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.960]   but it's also the biggest asset for the United States government.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.420]   So now if you want to be able to afford this life and build wealth, you're going to need
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.440]   more money.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.760]   And the way I look at it is, you know, saving is important.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.960]   When I say saving, I mean living below your means.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.120]   Living below your means is important, where you have extra cash.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   But there's only so much that you can cut.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.000]   There's only so many expenses that you can cut down.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.920]   And yes, some people are going to be more aggressive than others, but at the end of
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:59.160]   the day, if you're making $100,000 a year, there's only so much that you can cut.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.320]   Even if it's $30,000, there's only so much that you can cut, but there's no limit to
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   how much you can earn.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.680]   And so this is the growth mindset of understanding, okay, yes, I need to live below my means,
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.240]   I need to put some extra money aside for my, pay down my credit card debt to start investing,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.080]   to build wealth, to invest in my business, whatever it is, but now I need to earn more
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.820]   money that way I can actually accelerate my path to wealth.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:27.200]   And thanks to technology, it is more accessible than ever to be able to earn more income.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.280]   I mean, you can drive for Uber, you can drive for Lyft, you can deliver groceries for Amazon
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.040]   Fresh, you can deliver food for Grubhub, you can deliver food for Uber Eats.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.280]   Or if you want to be more involved with physical labor type of stuff, there are apps out there
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.200]   that allow you to help people move.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.280]   You can lift heavy things, you can, if you have a truck, you can transport stuff in your
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   truck or you can come onto things like Upwork and Fiverr.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.640]   And now you can offer your services, your thinking, your skills, you can be a writer,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.880]   you can be a graphic designer, you can be a video editor, you can be a voiceover artist.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.440]   There's so many things that you can do where if you have a skill, now you can market it
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.200]   and it has become so much more accessible because now you can go to one of these platforms,
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.560]   market your skill, and have somebody else who's looking for your skill pay you in order
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.880]   to do that.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.800]   And these are things that you can do on your own time, on your own schedule.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.480]   Like here at The Minority Mindset, we have our core team in the office, and then we have
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.920]   like a couple dozen or so freelancers that work with us, a dozen of them are writers,
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:39.240]   and they write on their own time, on their own schedule, and we send them topics, we
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.800]   give them deadlines, and then they can work their own job and write in the evenings or
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.080]   in the mornings or at the lunch break, or, you know, it doesn't matter to us when you
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.520]   write it, as long as you get it to us by the deadline, and it's a win-win.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:57.420]   Now you're providing value for the business or whoever you're working with, and you get
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.120]   extra payment, you get to do something that you love, something that you enjoy, and you
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:23.600]   can do this whenever you want.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.080]   I want to switch gears a little bit.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.720]   So we talked a lot about earning money, we talked about investing, but when I searched
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.240]   your YouTube channel, there were a ton of videos about hacks, and a lot of them were
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.300]   money hacks and side hustle hacks and that kind of thing.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.040]   One of the categories that we haven't spent much time on is spending less money.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   What are some of your favorite tips or maybe contrarian Minority Mindset pieces of advice
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.560]   for people to look to save a little bit more money?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.480]   So the interesting thing about this is there has to be a reason for why you are saving
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.920]   your money, because I grew up in a traditional Indian house, and the Indian culture is a
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.520]   save first culture.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.960]   And I joke around about this, but Indian people make a dollar to spend 20 cents, American
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.920]   people earn a dollar to spend $2, and so Indian people are bred with this save first mentality
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.800]   where they want to save as much money as possible.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.120]   So the question first is, why are you living below your means?
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.960]   Because if it's just to save money to save it, well, you know, there's better things
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.480]   that you can do.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.600]   So for me, it's really understanding why, because you have this debate in the financial
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.920]   industry of people arguing over Starbucks, oh, my God, you spend $4 on a latte?
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   Are you serious?
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.120]   If you compounded that $4 at 7% a year, do you know how much that would be worth?
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.960]   And people are arguing, is Starbucks a good or bad purchase?
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.760]   But that's the wrong question.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.480]   The question is, why are you spending or not spending money at Starbucks?
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.640]   Because if you're not spending money at Starbucks, just so you can save an extra $4, what is
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.200]   that going to do for you?
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.120]   But if you have a reason for not spending your money, because right now you're trying
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.040]   to build your business and you don't have any extra money because you're trying to invest
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.360]   every extra penny possible, you're trying to buy your first rental property.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.760]   This is where you can start to ask the question of, why am I cutting back?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:21.320]   For me, I was always big on investing into me and my real estate and my business.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.040]   And the first time I made $100,000 a year, I was in school, and I was a student, and
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   I was making good money.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.360]   You know, 100 grand a year when you're a student is really good, and you can show off a lot
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.800]   of nice things when you're in college with that type of money.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.120]   But I lived in an apartment where I was paying less than $400 a month, and that included
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:48.520]   my parking, my cable, my internet, my heat, and my electric, because I slept on the living
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.520]   room floor.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.760]   I kept a mattress in the hallway, and every night I would come there, drag the mattress
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:00.320]   into the living room, lay it down, put down my sheets, go to sleep, wake up, fold my sheets,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.880]   put them away, lift up the mattress, and put it back in the hallway.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.320]   Now, I was making good money.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.280]   I could have afforded a much nicer apartment, but the reason why I didn't do that was because
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.800]   I wanted to spend every penny possible and invest that right back into my business and
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.500]   to buy real estate.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.480]   And so, you've got to ask the question of why.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.160]   Now, when it comes to hacks, it's really just that discipline, man.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.080]   Like, I used to guest teach in Detroit Public Schools, and Detroit Public Schools, for those
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:32.220]   of you who don't know, it is a rougher school district where these kids, they grow up around
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.640]   a lot of rough things that the teachers have had a rough time teaching there, and it's
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   just a rougher area.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.800]   So, I wanted to volunteer and kind of help out.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.200]   I was guest speaking here, and I would just talk about life, motivation, money management,
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.520]   a whole bunch of different things.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   And I was talking to the kids at one of the classes, I asked them, "How many of y'all
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.720]   are working a job?"
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.120]   And a lot of them raised their hands.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.200]   Then I asked them, "How many guys have a bank account?"
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.320]   And almost nobody raised their hands.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.960]   So, you know, I got to talk to them, and I was like, "What do y'all do with your money?"
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.680]   So, what would happen is these kids, high school kids, would work at a job, they would
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.960]   get a physical check, then they would walk into a liquor store or a convenience store,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.720]   cash the check, where they would pay 1-10% in fees to cash that check, then they would
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:21.680]   go out and buy chips, pop, soda, candy, and on the way out, they'd only be left with half
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.640]   of their check.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.760]   And so, this is where I was like, "All right, we need to change the way that we're using
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   our money."
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.840]   So, I created what I call the Rule of Five, and what that says is if you cannot buy five
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.400]   of them, you cannot afford one of them.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   So, now we're talking about liabilities, things that you don't need to survive, where there's
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.520]   a big difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford something.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.680]   Because when I was talking to these kids, everyone said, "If I had $100 in my bank account,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.040]   I can afford a $100 pair of shoes."
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.520]   But that's not the case.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.480]   Just because you can buy a $100 pair of shoes does not mean that you can afford it.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.360]   Nowadays, if you want to buy a $100 pair of shoes, you don't even need $100.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.000]   All you need is a credit card or access to these buy-and-I'll-pay-later platforms.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.720]   But what you have to understand is there's a huge difference between being able to buy
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.120]   something and being able to afford something.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.000]   And now, when we talk about using your money the right way, you have to know the difference.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.960]   And so, I like to follow the Rule of Five.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   If you can't buy five of them, you can't afford one of them.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.280]   If you want a $100 pair of shoes, you better be able to buy at least five of them before
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.380]   you can afford one of them.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.380]   I love it.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.980]   I love that rule of thumb that I think I could probably find some purchases in my past history
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.260]   that wouldn't have applied and now, hopefully, less.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.260]   You know, we've all been there.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   We've all been there, though.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.540]   When I was younger, I used to make a lot of dumb purchases.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.540]   It's that shift, right?
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.220]   You start to see their mindset.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.020]   When I was younger, I used to spend my money on a whole bunch of dumb things because that's
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.480]   what's normal.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.060]   When I was in high school and I was making money, I wanted to look rich.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.460]   So, the first time I had a gig that I did and I made $1,000, I was like, "Oh, my God.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.460]   I made $1,000."
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.860]   It's a lot of money when you're in high school.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:09.780]   So, I went out and I bought a $1,000 watch, like literally spent all $1,000 on one watch
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:14.140]   and it was like lined up with crystals all around it, supposed to look like diamonds.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.820]   And it was just like super flashy and blingy just because I wanted to look rich.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.660]   I mean, back then, it was like anytime I made some extra cash, I upgraded my car.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:29.740]   I was driving this Toyota and I put tints on my windows, I upgraded the rims, put on
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.380]   some custom rims, I put in two 12-inch subwoofers in the trunk, I upgraded my sound system,
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.380]   I put in HID lights.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.340]   I mean, I used to watch a lot of Pimp My Ride in case you couldn't tell.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:45.620]   So, I wanted to have the coolest car and I would "invest" my money into my car to look
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.620]   rich.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.220]   But then when I started learning about money and I started understanding, "Okay, I want
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.220]   to become wealthy.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.980]   I want to be able to take care of my family.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   I want something better."
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.420]   So, now you mix that mindset with the right financial education and all of a sudden, my
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.180]   spending changed.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.980]   I stopped spending money on things because I wanted to buy assets.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.500]   And now it's like you want to buy as many assets as you can because you want to take
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   care of yourself.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.260]   You want to be able to live off your assets and then you want to take care of your family.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.080]   That way, you never have to worry about money.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.140]   That way, you can live your life and do whatever you want because wealth ultimately is freedom.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.200]   And everything that we do, you want to have freedom to live your life and do whatever
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:29.380]   it is that you want because when you have the freedom, it's much easier to do things
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.780]   that you love and do the things that you want.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.540]   Are there any things now that you think you spend money on that people would love to hear
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.820]   about?
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.860]   It doesn't have to be anything big.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.580]   When you have more money, it's nice to be able to afford luxury things and everybody
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.580]   likes that.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.740]   But it really starts with the small stuff because I love working out.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.840]   I'm a gym guy and I have a gym bag that I keep with me.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.340]   And before, what I used to do is I used to have my deodorant, my toothbrush, my body
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.940]   wash, all my stuff.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.500]   I had one of each of these things and I kept it in my home.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.980]   Then I'd go to the gym every day.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:11.140]   I'd take these things from my bathroom, put it in my gym bag, walk over to the gym, workout,
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.380]   shower, do all my stuff in the gym, use my toiletries, come home, take all this stuff
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.380]   out, put it back in my bathroom.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.380]   And it was a pain.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.020]   Then you start making some money.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.660]   And then I was like, "You know what?
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.100]   I'm going to make my life a little bit easier."
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.980]   So then I bought a second deodorant, a second body wash, a second beard comb, and you start
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.580]   buying.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   It's convenience.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.620]   And now all of a sudden when I go to the gym, I don't got to take it out of my bathroom.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.820]   I just pick up my gym bag and I go.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.620]   And it's like, "Wow, I made it in life."
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.560]   It's like it starts with the little things and you're able to buy more convenience.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:54.740]   And this is where money has the ability to buy convenience for you, but you got to pick
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.980]   and choose what it is that you want.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.460]   And for some people, it's going to be some things, and for others, it's going to be other
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.940]   things.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.020]   I go to India pretty often because my family is in India.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.540]   And when we used to go to India, I used to sit in an economy class.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:17.040]   But oh my God, going to India, an 18-hour flight, sitting in an economy class, you're
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.000]   sitting like a sardine.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.600]   You sit there, you can't move, you got someone on your left, you got someone on your right.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   You can't extend your legs, you got someone in front of you.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.040]   You can recline like three inches and you sit there and you wait for the flight attendant
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.040]   to serve you some food.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.240]   And then you can't eat with your elbows to your shoulders and you're stuck.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.720]   And it is so uncomfortable.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.900]   I mean, it's such a long flight.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.360]   And then when you walk in, it's funny that they do this because when you walk in, you're
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.120]   going to walk past the business class seats.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.440]   And these business class seats, they're huge.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.240]   And I used to always walk past them like, "I wonder what these people do.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   How do you afford these seats?"
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.760]   Because it's like three to five times more to sit in business than it does in economy.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.840]   I was like, "How do these people afford this?"
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.720]   Because their seats are like, you get your own cabin, you get your own little compartment
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.320]   and your seat turns into a bed and you have this flight attendant that comes and serves
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.800]   you and talks to you and they call you, "Sir" and "Ma'am" and I was like, "Oh my God, that's
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   so cool."
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.760]   And still, in terms of luxuries, the first time I flew business to India, oh my God,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   my life changed.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760]   I could not believe it.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   I could not believe what it was like to sit in a seat like that for 18 hours.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.400]   I'm like, "Man, time flies."
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.360]   Life becomes more convenient.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   That's amazing.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   Awesome.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   Well, this has been so fantastic.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.760]   I appreciate you sharing all these things.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.680]   What are you working on right now?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.320]   Where can people find it?
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.480]   We're really just working on helping to spread that financial education and this is across
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   different platforms.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.640]   Obviously, we have our YouTube channel, Minority Mindset.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.040]   We recently launched a new YouTube channel called Minority Mindset News where we publish
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.480]   daily news updates in the top finance and business world.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.240]   We have all of our socials @MinorityMindset.

[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Go check it out.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Well, thanks for sharing.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I've checked it out.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Hopefully, people will too.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.640]   I really appreciate you being here.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.840]   I'm a little sad we didn't end up talking about guacamole since I know that's a big
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.880]   thing for you and I also share the passion but, oh man, I dig it.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880]   I dig it.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   Me too.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   Thanks for being here.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.520]   This was a lot of fun.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   That was great.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.720]   If you watch any of Jaspreet's videos, you'll see how passionate he is about everything
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.940]   he does.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:39.520]   And speaking of videos, I've actually been recording most of the videos of these interviews
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.360]   and I'm going to be putting them all up on YouTube, so I'll share more when they're up
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   there.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:50.200]   Also, thank you to everyone who's emailed questions, feedback, hacks, and so much more.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.520]   Please keep them coming for the next Q&A episode and especially keep sharing your favorite
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.800]   hacks because I'm going to start including them in this soon-to-be-relaunched weekly
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   newsletter.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.080]   Finally, thank you so much for listening.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:09.160]   You can find me at chris@allthehacks.com and I'll see you next week.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   Bye.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   Bye.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   Bye.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.660]   Bye.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660]   Bye.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.660]   Bye.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:14.660]   Bye.
