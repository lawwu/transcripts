[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.460]   do we need a what?
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.080]   yeah we're going to need a flashlight
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.900]   be quiet

[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.160]   I don't know how late of a sleeper she is
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.080]   he's done though
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.820]   do I need this?
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.180]   put your hand over it a little bit
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:50.640]   woke up this morning feeling alive and well
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.040]   I got my 8 hours of sleep in last night
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.320]   this was a necessity
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.800]   so I got some good sleep
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.140]   and I woke up feeling good today
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.000]   woke up with this amazing view outside the room
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.740]   this morning's been going well all around man
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.100]   I woke up in time for breakfast today
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.880]   after a rough morning yesterday
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.640]   got some eggs

[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.160]   pulled up to the fitness center
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   even though I'm out here on a little vacation
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.540]   still got to get that work in
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:39.080]   some good coconut water
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.320]   one of the best things you can do
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.200]   to hydrate
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:11:06.220]   man the camera hit cut off while I was doing the stairmaster
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.940]   but we just finished off a little conditioning
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.460]   50 floors
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.380]   in about 7.5-8 minutes
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.580]   I was at level 11 or level 12
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.540]   so about 105 steps per minute
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.600]   and we went

[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.020]   and got 50 floors
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.140]   they got a little outdoor court out here

[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.480]   get some shots up for a little bit
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.180]   before I hit the pool

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   Man, it's too lit in there for me, man.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   Had to take me a little break.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   Thank you, sir.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   All right, sir.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   You want to say something real quick?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   Hold up.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   I mean, I'm still right.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   What do you have to say about tonight?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   Well, listen, life is full of ups and downs.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   This don't got to go on the vlog.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   I just wanted to know what you're going to say.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   No, I don't got to go on the vlog.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   But I want it to go on the vlog.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   All right, so tell me some good shit.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   I got some good shit I need to say, man.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   So far that I am, I am just a man.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   But it's been a up and down weekend.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   But that's like life.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   It's like too many people are focused on the light
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   at the end of the tunnel instead of realizing
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   that the tunnel itself is life.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   There's a wise man right here.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   You're a fool on YouTube.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   I normally don't drink or get too lit, man.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   But we had a fun time this weekend,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   celebrating my boy Austin's birthday.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   Obviously, the concert last night.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   So I'm here at the spa getting a little recovery working.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   But this spa is dope, man.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   It's like you're in the middle of the rain forest.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   I'm at the St. Regis out here in Puerto Rico.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   Checking out their spa.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Got the hot tub right here.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   Relaxation room.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   Then you walk over here and you got the cold plunge, steam room.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400]   So I'm going to do all of it.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Sitting here in the hot tub right now.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   I got a good little protocol whenever I do go out or I drink a little bit.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   I like to get in the hot tub, sweat it all out.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   So if you got a steam room or a hot tub, that's what I recommend.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   And then from there you just got to hydrate.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   So I like coconut water.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   It's my go-to thing to rehydrate.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   Some vitamin water.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   I like vitamin water too.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   But yeah, after a night of going out or something, I like to get in the hot tub, sweat it all out.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   And then the cold plunge is a bonus too because once you're done in the hot tub and you sweat for a little bit,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   hop it in that cold plunge, it'll get you back right quick.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   I'm nervous, man.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   I'm about to hop in this cold plunge.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   I ain't been in the cold plunge since the end of the basketball season.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   So I know it's about to be brick in there.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   Woo-hoo-hoo!
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   Feel good though.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   Yeah, I ain't gonna lie y'all.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   It's pretty brick in here.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   Just got done with a smooth little spa day.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   Feel super relaxed, man.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   A great way to cap off the weekend.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   And yeah, now I'm about to hit the airport.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   So appreciate y'all watching these vlogs, man.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   This one was a dope.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   I highly recommend Puerto Rico.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Y'all gotta stop by the St. Regis out here and check out the scenery.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   So appreciate y'all tuning in, man.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   It carries Mike out.
