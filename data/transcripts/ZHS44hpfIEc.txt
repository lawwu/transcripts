[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   This week we welcome to the podcast parenting guru Ted Tripp as our guest on the podcast.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   Dr. Tripp is the author of two bestselling books, Shepherding a Child's Heart and Instructing
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   a Child's Heart.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.180]   Dr. Tripp, I want to ask you, when you look around the church today and the condition
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.320]   of families, what do you think is right now the single greatest threat to the Christian
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   home?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.160]   Well, I think a huge issue really has to be confronted and the elephant in the room that
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.800]   we're not talking about nearly enough and that is we have an awful lot of men who are
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.520]   Christian men with wives and children who are addicted to porn.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.800]   And they're going on the websites, they're going places they shouldn't go, work, they
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.920]   sit at the computer all day, they have these periodic dalliances with porn or maybe even
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   just dive wholesale into it.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.760]   But the fact is that that stuff is deadening to their souls.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.880]   And so you have a guy that shows up at church, he's, you know, the hymns are being projected,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.800]   you know, on the screen, the family is singing, he's singing, he's trying to sing, he wants
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.160]   to be drawn into this worship, but his soul is so dead inside him because he has titillated
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.760]   himself all week and the things about God seem fairy-tale-ish and unreal to him and
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.640]   they're not compelling.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.200]   And I think that that's a huge issue that is confronting a lot of Christian families.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.480]   I think a lot of times, now sometimes wives know about it, sometimes they don't, a lot
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.880]   of times wives don't know and they're confused, they can't understand why is this guy so disconnected,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.640]   so disjointed because, you know, pornography just feeds a whole private world of my personal,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   you know, it's all about me and it's like any addiction, it's all about me.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.080]   You know, I think there's an interesting, you know, biblical take on addiction.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   I don't like the language of alcoholism and so forth, and, you know, sometimes people
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   think of addictions as though they're medical conditions and then you remove the ethical
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.760]   and moral aspect of it.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.880]   But I think Proverbs, at the end of Proverbs chapter 5, I think it's verse 21, it says,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.320]   "The wicked deeds of an evil man ensnare him and the cords of his sin hold him fast."
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.200]   That's really a biblical take on addiction.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.600]   People make choices that are choices that lock them in and ensnare them and they become
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.520]   bound in the cords of that sin.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.240]   And you know, I think there's some wonderful resources for helping yourself, you know,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.120]   and wonderful online resources for getting help and counseling and so forth, but I think,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.720]   you know, men need to face that problem head on and churches need to be speaking to that
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.600]   issue far more clearly than we are, I think.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   So very true.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.920]   And I mean, this sin disrupts a man from engaging God at church.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.520]   So explain how this problem then manifests itself inside the home.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.500]   Well, I think it's on various levels, because on one level, he feels hypocritical when he
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.260]   steps up as a spiritual leader in the home, obviously, because his loyalties are divided.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760]   And because of that, he is reluctant to step up and be a spiritual leader in the home.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.260]   He feels, you know, like he doesn't have the right to speak.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.640]   And even if his wife has no idea, because this goes on at work and she never knows about
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   it, or he does it secretively and she doesn't know, he still is a reluctant and non-participating
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.520]   spiritual leader because he is compromised by his porn addiction.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.160]   Now if the wife knows about it, that even in some ways makes it worse, not worse that
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.840]   she knows, but it increases that sense of impotence to speak the truth into any situation
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.720]   of life, because not only is he a hypocrite, she knows he's a hypocrite and his hypocrisy
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.520]   has been exposed.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.840]   So I think the implications, and the implications for kids, you know, I cannot tell you the
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.480]   number of times, Tony, when I've been involved in counseling with families where a young
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.400]   teenager discovered what dad's been doing on the internet, or walked in on dad and he
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.320]   quickly slammed the computer shut, but the kid knew what was going on.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   And then, you know, that just undermines any spiritual leadership, obviously.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.160]   You know, it is just a terribly, terribly destructive thing.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.560]   Unfortunately, I think it's just far more common than we're willing to acknowledge.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.120]   I saw a survey recently, I think just in the past week or so, that porn addiction is actually
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.360]   a greater problem amongst Christian men than it is amongst secular men.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   I didn't drill into that to see why they had drawn that conclusion, but I thought it was
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   an interesting observation.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   Tragic.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   It is.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.040]   Thank you, Dr. Tripp.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120]   And in fact, that survey was released by Proven Men Ministries in the Barna Group in August.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.420]   You can find it with a Google search.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.640]   The title is "Pornography, Use, and Addiction."
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.320]   And of course, this episode was merely analytical, not intended to get into the strategies for
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   combating lust.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   If you need help to address a porn addiction in your life, please see several episodes
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:23.760]   that we recorded in this podcast series, specifically episodes number 304, 291, 165, 60, and 18.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   the Android.
