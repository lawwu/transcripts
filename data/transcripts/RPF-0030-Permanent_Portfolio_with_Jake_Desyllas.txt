[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.920]   On today's show, what if it were possible to build a portfolio that could succeed no
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.280]   matter what the economic climate happened to be?
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.020]   And what if that portfolio were incredibly simple, incredibly low cost, and incredibly
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020]   low maintenance?
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.200]   Could it exist?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.000]   Today's show is a discussion with Jake DeSilis of The Voluntary Life of Harry Brown's concept
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:16.440]   of the permanent portfolio.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.400]   So welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Tuesday, July 29, 2014.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.600]   Today's show is going to be an interview with Jake DeSilis of The Voluntary Life, and today
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.840]   we're going to be talking about the permanent portfolio, which is an investment concept
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080]   pioneered by a man named Harry Brown.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.120]   And we're going to talk all about that in detail and have a conversation.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   I hope you'll find it interesting.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   The name Jake DeSilis may be familiar to you.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   If you remember, he was already on the show.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.280]   He was on the show with Episode, I think it was 22, was it?
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   Hold on just a moment.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   Let me check.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.880]   Jake DeSilis, Jake DeSilis, Episode 20, Entrepreneurship.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.280]   Show entitled Entrepreneurship is the only opportunity to seek financial freedom that
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   is open to anyone.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   So that's Episode 20.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.080]   If you enjoyed that interview, or even if you enjoyed this one, go back and listen to
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   that one.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   You'll find it at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/20.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.480]   But at today's show, we're going to talk about something a little different.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.140]   So I've enjoyed Jake's podcasts over the years, and I've thought that he did an excellent
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220]   job in the past discussing the concept of the permanent portfolio.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.360]   And so I thought it'd be more fun to bring a guest on and talk about the concept together
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.260]   rather than me just talking on and on about it.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160]   Because I think it's a really valuable concept.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.740]   So today's show, we're going to talk about the permanent portfolio.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.560]   Before we do that, and I'm not going to do much in the intro here as far as talking about
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.860]   details.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.240]   Before we do that, I do have to give just a quick disclaimer.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.860]   Anytime we talk about investment philosophies and investment topics, and unfortunately this
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.860]   is important.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.640]   I know you get tired of these stupid disclaimers, but they are important.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   I'm going to bring a lot of people on this show.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   My goal.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720]   I want to bring a lot of people on this show from a lot of different philosophies and grill
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   them.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   I view having a podcast as kind of my little opportunity to ask people all the questions
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.480]   I've wanted to ask them but never had time to ask them in the past.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.240]   So I'll try to bring people on from all different walks of the investing world.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.320]   I'll try to bring people on that I agree with, that I disagree with.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.880]   I will talk about agreeing with people and disagreeing with people.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.680]   I'm just interested in learning, and I love to bring people on that I disagree with more
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.020]   than - probably more than I would do people that I agree with.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.600]   And so this is just the start about that.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.200]   I want to provide some really great content as far as providing some real meat for you
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.380]   when it comes to thinking through investments.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.360]   But none of this is going to be investment recommendations.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   None of it is investment suggestions.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   That's very important.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.280]   That's not just a disclaimer that people put on radio shows.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   Your situation is incredibly unique, and there is - my opinion - there is no one investment
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.160]   strategy that's going to serve everybody because depending on where you're at in your financial
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.400]   plan, depending on where you're at in your life cycle, depending on where you're at as
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.160]   a person, on what your personal inclinations and proclivities are, that's what's going
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.480]   to ultimately design - determine your investment choices.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.760]   So I'm going to try to bring you lots of even conflicting guests on here, and I'm doing
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.440]   that by design to try to help you to think.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.600]   And my hope is that as time goes on, you'll start to see and understand the things that
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.000]   are similar among different investing approaches and the things that are different.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.280]   And then with greater education, you'll be able to figure out what's right for you.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920]   So that's going to be today's show.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.140]   I'm excited about doing it.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.140]   The interview is pre-recorded, so I'm going to play it now.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.840]   But I really enjoyed doing the interview, and I hope that you enjoy listening.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.760]   So here's the interview, and then I'll be back with some additional thoughts for you.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.440]   So Jake, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.920]   I'm glad you're here with us again.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   So last time we talked about entrepreneurship, and I enjoyed that conversation, and I'm sure
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.280]   we could talk for a few more hours about that.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.600]   But I know that we've got a couple of other things that we would enjoy talking about.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   And one of the things that I wanted to talk about today is a concept called the permanent
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.140]   portfolio.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.720]   So we'll let you kind of explain a little bit of what that is.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.980]   But I thought where we'd start is, how did you first come in contact with the concept
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.200]   of the permanent portfolio?
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.680]   How did you discover it?
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.880]   Yeah, well, I discovered it through Harry Brown.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   So I read Harry Brown's book, How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World, which is a book
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.960]   about achieving freedom in your own life.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.360]   It's a great book, and it was really influential on me.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.640]   And it's actually been really influential on my podcast, Voluntary Life.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.720]   And so I knew that book, and I knew about Harry Brown, and I knew that he had made his
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.480]   money as an investment advisor.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   And I was just getting really serious about getting into investing at the same time.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.960]   This is sort of in the early 2000s.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.120]   And so I found his radio show, which he was doing at the time, an investment radio show.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.480]   And I downloaded all the MP3s of his episodes on investment.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.040]   And I also read a book of his, which he describes the permanent portfolio, which is called Failsafe
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   Investing.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.360]   And that's, by the way, a very good introduction to the permanent portfolio.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.600]   But that's how I found out about it.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.280]   It was originally through Harry Brown, who was the guy who basically came up with this
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.160]   strategy.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   And I read loads of other investment books and other investment sort of approaches.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.880]   And I found lots of useful stuff in them.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.680]   But nothing convinced me.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.440]   Nothing really worked for me or seemed to be as useful and to fit my needs as much as
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.680]   the approach of the permanent portfolio.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.600]   And by the way, I just wanted to say also, I should say at the beginning that I'm an
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.280]   individual investor, and I use the permanent portfolio.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.520]   And in our discussion, I can talk about my reasons for choosing this approach and why
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   it works for me.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.720]   Anyone listening, obviously, you'll have to do your own research.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.000]   You'll have to decide for yourself which investment approach works and make your own decisions
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.220]   about your money.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.600]   So I'm not going to give advice.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.240]   But I will explain why I think it's the best approach for me.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.880]   And hopefully, that can be useful for others who are interested.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   I think that's super valuable because there are a lot of excellent investment approaches.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.340]   And one of the things that I'm kind of developing when the show is where I talk about investments
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:52.300]   is that the key to any investment philosophy is understanding your philosophy and understanding
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.360]   what your goals are and understanding what you're trying to accomplish so that you can
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.240]   stick with that philosophy in the good times and the bad times.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.520]   And what I've observed is a lot of times, people don't understand their philosophy and
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.600]   they don't understand what they're actually doing.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.360]   For example, I'm very attracted to the permanent portfolio, but I don't practice it because
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.560]   it's not appropriate, as I perceive, for my needs.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.480]   So I love the way that you said that.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   It's important.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.560]   It's not just a stick-in disclaimer here.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   It's important.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.480]   You need to understand what you're trying to accomplish and then the strengths and weaknesses
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.840]   of whatever investment philosophy and strategy you're following.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.800]   So go ahead and follow that path along.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.400]   What attracts you to the -- first of all, explain what the permanent portfolio is and
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.000]   then what attracts you to it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.440]   And just one more point on what you just said, actually.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   Really, really great point that Harry Brown makes in his book and in his approach to investing
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.240]   is one of his fundamental rules is that you should never invest in anything that you don't
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.800]   understand.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.080]   And that, to me, is -- I really took that to heart.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.640]   And I think that's really important, that whatever approach you follow, it's really
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.480]   important to know why you're following that approach and to understand what you're doing
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.760]   with your money so that you have -- you're making informed choices.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.280]   When I first got interested in investing, I went to a bunch of investment advisors in
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.440]   my bank and other banks and various places, and they all basically said, "Entrust us with
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   your money, and we will put it into this fund, and this fund does really well."
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.040]   And I said, "Okay, well, what's the strategy of the fund?"
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.840]   And then there was a lot of talking and a lot of smoke and a lot of mirrors, and I could
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.960]   never get to the bottom of it.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   And in fact, it was at the same time that I was getting interested in the permanent
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   portfolio.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.760]   So I would say, "Well, look, here's this strategy.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.320]   It's so clear that I can backtest it, and I have backtested it for the last 10 years,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.120]   so show me your backtest of your strategy."
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.200]   And they couldn't do that because their strategy was ad hoc and it was done on the fly.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.320]   And so that's one of the things that's great about this approach is I understand it, and
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   you can too, and it's very transparent and clear.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:13.440]   And that was one of the reasons why I kept finding this to be the right approach.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.480]   I think that was a long detour, and I'm not sure I answered your question.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.120]   What was it you were asking me?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.280]   Let me actually jump in, and then we'll go back to the question because it's an important
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   point.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.920]   There was something -- so I come from that world of being an investment advisor.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.600]   I'm a former investment advisor, and professionally in those meetings.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.480]   And there are a number of problems, which we don't need to get to right here, but this
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.640]   is one of the major problems in investment advice is that looking back on -- if you're
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.320]   talking with an individual advisor about what their specific strategy is, there are very
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.160]   few clear, replicatable industry standards for, "This is how I've done.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.280]   Let me prove to you what I've done."
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:01.120]   Because if you are actually managing individual portfolios for clients, then each client's
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.240]   results are going to be different based upon what that client needs.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.760]   And so it's very challenging to answer that question, and rightly so, but yet it's an
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.620]   important one that does need to be answered.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.360]   But the main point I was going to give is that one thing I used to tell, which is why
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.200]   I like in Harry Brown's book and his book, "Failsafe Investing," don't do anything you
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   don't understand.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.240]   I used to tell this to my clients, and they would often not take me up on it, but I still
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.120]   think it's valuable advice.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   And it is hard to put into practice, but years ago, I remember when I was a teenager, I was
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:39.040]   listening to a Brian Tracy tape, and he said, "Spend as much time researching the investment
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.600]   opportunity that you have as it took you to earn the money that you're going to put into
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.000]   the opportunity."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.120]   And the point was that if you're going to make a $10 investment, well, go ahead and
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   research that for as much time as it takes you to earn $10.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.600]   If you're going to make a $10,000 investment, don't make that investment until you've spent
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.960]   an equivalent amount of time as it might take you to earn $10,000 learning about the investment.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.680]   Now I think that that's not the struggle with even saying that, and I would tell it to my
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.320]   clients just to kind of encourage them to do their due diligence and understand their
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.460]   strategies.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.240]   You reach a point where you can't practically do that once your portfolio grows large, but
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.360]   by then you'll be so far down the road that you'll be well-educated and you'll really
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.240]   understand what it is that you're doing.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.680]   So if you're doing something yourself, if you're a do-it-yourselfer, that's fine.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   Understand your strategy so that you stick with it.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.680]   If you're hiring a professional advisor for some services that they provide, that's fine.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.040]   Then you'll understand what services that professional advisor is providing or isn't
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   providing.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.320]   And you won't assume that they're doing something that they're actually not capable of doing.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.680]   You won't assume that you're hiring your advisor to beat the market when I, as an advisor,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.320]   would tell a client quite clearly, "Listen, I'm not capable of doing that, so don't hire
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.720]   me for that."
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.200]   And so the research and the understanding is so key.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.100]   That's why, frankly, Jake, that's why I'm creating the show, is to try to provide straight
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:09.120]   talk on all this stuff to give people a tool in their arsenal when they're trying to research
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   these topics.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.400]   Right, right.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   So the question was, I can't remember what the question was.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.760]   Basically, explain what the permanent portfolio is and how it works, first of all.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.240]   Yeah, okay.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.080]   So let me back up a little bit before that, because I can go into say, "This is the portfolio
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.480]   and this is what it works," but just to explain the criteria for the portfolio.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.200]   So there's very different approaches to investing.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.280]   And like what you were just saying, some people may prefer to entrust their investment to
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.500]   somebody else to manage and so forth.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.640]   Other people prefer to manage things themselves.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.720]   And that's definitely with this approach, the permanent portfolio is more for people
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.380]   who are interested in managing their own investments.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.780]   Then there are various approaches to investing as to whether or not you want to be an active
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:01.520]   investor and be trying to time the market and speculate on the next big thing, or whether
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.400]   you take the approach that it's really hard to get that right.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.140]   It's an art, not a science.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.040]   And you can't predict what's going to happen in markets, and therefore you need a more
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.440]   passive investment strategy.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.040]   And that's true of the permanent portfolio.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.740]   But unlike some of the passive investment strategies that are very focused on stocks,
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.720]   the permanent portfolio also tries to tackle another concern that many investors have,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.920]   and that is to do with the fragility and the problems with the economy that comes from
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.760]   manipulation and the money supply.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:43.160]   In particular, the problems that come from central banks controlling interest rates and
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.720]   the damage that that can cause, either in creating inflation or in creating depression.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.120]   And we can go into maybe the details a bit more of that.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.920]   But these are some of the concerns that are behind the permanent portfolio.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:02.120]   And so as a strategy, the permanent portfolio is a passive investment strategy that involves
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.280]   splitting your investments into four different asset classes.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.920]   And you split your investments into those four different asset classes in order to be
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:21.200]   able to do well or survive or not get completely hammered in any specific economic situation
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.640]   that you can envisage.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:33.200]   And so the four asset classes are stocks, cash or short-term treasury bonds, long-term
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.560]   bonds or long-term treasuries, and gold.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.040]   And so those are the four fixed categories that you invest in.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.560]   And you basically split your portfolio equally, 25% between these four.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:59.920]   And the idea is what you do is you rebalance periodically when any one of those investments
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.000]   reaches a rebalancing band.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.560]   And people have different rebalancing bands.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.720]   The one that most people use is if it drops to below 15% or if it goes to above 35% or
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.460]   some people use 40% of your total portfolio.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:20.240]   So when you do that, what you're doing is you're saying, basically, I don't know what's
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.320]   going to happen.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.280]   Maybe we're going to have hyperinflation.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.880]   So I'm going to hold some gold.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.200]   Or maybe we're going to have economic prosperity.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.880]   So I'm going to hold some stocks.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.480]   Or maybe we're going to have a tight money recession.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480]   So I'm going to hold cash.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.560]   And I'm also going to have cash so that I can take advantage of any rebalancing opportunities.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.880]   Or maybe we're going to have a long-term depression.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.080]   So I'm going to hold long-term bonds.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.840]   Because in each of those economic circumstances, those assets tend to be the ones that the
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.640]   money rushes into.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.040]   So you kind of split your portfolio between those four asset classes.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.500]   And then you basically just rebalance.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.620]   So if you get to a point where it's like, wow, gold seems to have done really well.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.620]   So there we go.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.600]   Now I've got 40% of my portfolio in gold or 35% of my portfolio in gold.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.240]   You sell that down and rebalance back to 25% each.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:17.000]   And in doing that, what you're doing is you're basically selling the assets that are expensive.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.680]   And you're buying the assets that are cheap.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:29.000]   And much of the benefit of the permanent portfolio comes from what people term volatility harvesting.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.320]   So you basically-- if the markets are going all over the place, and some stuff's going
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.720]   up and down, and people are finding it really hard to predict, if you take the approach,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.640]   well, I just can't predict what's going to happen.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.120]   Maybe long-term, there's going to be hyperinflation.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.080]   But that could be five years, 10 years.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.360]   Who knows?
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   Maybe long-term, there's going to be prosperity.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.980]   But we could stay in this kind of economic doldrums for years longer, like Japan did.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.480]   So what you're doing is you're saying, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.960]   But I do know that whatever happens, I will have assets that will do well in any economic
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.520]   environment that I can envisage.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.040]   And therefore, I'll basically use those to carry the portfolio through.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:18.000]   And in doing so, you don't benefit from the big highs that, for example, stocks have in
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:27.760]   the 1990s, when you had years where you were getting 20%-plus growth in stocks in multiple
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   years.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.400]   You don't benefit as much from those big highs.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.880]   But on the other side, you also don't get the big lows when you get a stock market crash.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:47.800]   And you basically even out a lot of the volatility, whilst, in general, protecting yourself from
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.880]   any really significant economic catastrophes.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.360]   It's a very humble approach to investing.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.680]   And that's one of the things that I like about it, is that basically, the idea is, let me
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.400]   just admit that I'm not a genius, which, for many people who get involved in investing,
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.440]   is very challenging to make that admission.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.480]   But let me admit that I'm not a genius.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:17.080]   And let me see if I can design a system that will work no matter what.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.120]   And I highlighted four paragraphs here, short paragraphs, at the end of Harry Brown's book,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.960]   "Failsafe Investing."
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.120]   And to me, I think it displays exactly what you're talking about, as far as just this
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.880]   idea of, I'm a human.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.220]   I can't know it all.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.760]   So let me design a plan that works no matter what.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.640]   And these four paragraphs say this.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.600]   The beginning of investment wisdom is to accept that we live in an uncertain world, and that
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.960]   we can never have enough information to know for certain why the market went up or down
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.240]   today, let alone what it's going to do tomorrow.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.320]   We only know a little about the present and much less about the future.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.420]   No one can tell you when the stock market will peak, how far it will fall, or which
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.960]   market group will lead the way back up.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.740]   Human beings aren't able to foresee the future in any useful way.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:11.280]   For every example cited of an investment forecast that came true, I can point to five that didn't,
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.360]   some of which may have come from the same forecaster.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.600]   Only when you abandon the hope that some advisor, some system, some source of inside tips is
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.480]   going to give you a shortcut to wealth do you gain control over your financial future.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.340]   And when you give up the search for certainty, an enormous burden is lifted from your shoulders.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:35.280]   You can begin to invest realistically, and that's much easier than the search for certainty.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.280]   And just a couple of words on that.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.000]   I mean, you know, I think there is a humility there in what Harry Brown's approach is.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.160]   And also, it's also a question of taking economics seriously.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.840]   You know, in economics, you know, there is a very clear understanding, especially the
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.640]   Austrian School of Economics, there's a very clear understanding that human action is not
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.640]   predictable.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.840]   It's not systematically predictable.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.520]   It's an art to try and work out what's going to happen in the future with people.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.960]   It's not a science.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.600]   You can make predictions, and you can luck out, but it's not systematic.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.800]   And if you take that to heart, as all the passive investors do who invest in index funds
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.160]   for stocks, they all kind of have taken that to heart in one respect, in that they've said,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.960]   like, look, we can't predict which stocks are going to work, so we're just going to
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.840]   take an index fund, and we're just going to sit it out and basically not speculate.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.120]   And I think that approach is great, and that's exactly what the permanent portfolio does
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.960]   in stocks, is it holds an index fund of stocks across the whole stock market.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.000]   But the permanent portfolio takes that approach even further and says, OK, so we can't predict
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.600]   which individual stocks are going to go up and down, but we also can't predict whether
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:58.360]   or not stocks as an asset class are going to suffer for, you know, a decade like they
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.820]   did in the 1970s or in the 2000s.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:07.600]   And so as well as being passive in terms of your allocation of stocks, it also takes a
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:14.000]   much broader look at the economy and says, I want to be out not just in one asset class,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.280]   because even though if you only have stocks you can do really well in decades like the
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.680]   '90s, who knows whether another decade like the 1970s or the 2000s is coming along where
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.520]   you could spend 10 years not keeping up with inflation.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.720]   And that's tough.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.960]   That's a long time to basically be losing money from your investments.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.640]   And so that's the other sort of side of that humility is it's a humility in that you don't
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.920]   sort of think that, you know, you know the future and you're a wizard.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.440]   But it's also just simply realistic about economics.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:59.320]   I like that it brings in a discussion of the problems of central banking and the control
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.800]   of the central banking system and the central bankers try to influence on the economic system.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.320]   I assume that that, although I haven't researched it, and correct me if I'm wrong, I assume
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.720]   that this was a big, big factor in Harry Brown's, you know, in his background coming as a libertarian
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.480]   and then, you know, eventually running for president as a libertarian candidate a couple
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.640]   of times in the end of the 20th century.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.800]   And so kind of trying to say how can I design an investment approach that will take this
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.280]   into account and function?
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.840]   Because all of those four aspects, all of that is based, those things are not the four
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.360]   scenarios that we can have, whether depression, inflation, deflation, you know, tight money
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   recession.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.040]   None of that is based upon, none of that is based upon an individual company's performance.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:54.720]   That's all based upon the business cycle and based upon trying to counteract what the central
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.000]   banking system is going to do.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.560]   And I like the permanent portfolio, especially for people who are very concerned about those
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   aspects.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.320]   You know, I've had a number of people, a lot of people are constantly asking questions.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.360]   What do we do with the dollar?
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.320]   And the dollar is getting weaker and so therefore isn't the right move to sell all my stocks
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   and buy gold and silver coins.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.800]   And so to me, this is a more rational approach where if you're concerned about that, instead
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.600]   of saying that you know exactly what's going to happen, instead of saying that you know
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.180]   that the dollar is definitely doomed, that stocks are definitely going to crash because
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:37.320]   your latest prognosticator has said so, and that gold is definitely going to be the thing
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:45.480]   that goes up in value, you can take a more modest standpoint.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.200]   And now you're prepared if we have a time of prosperity, you're prepared if we have
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.400]   a time of inflation, you're prepared if we have a time of recession, and you're prepared
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.440]   if we have a time of deflation.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.960]   And so I think this is a more rational, for people that are very concerned about central
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.600]   bank activities and things like that and their influence on the economy, I think this is
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.800]   a really rational approach for them to consider.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:12.000]   Yeah, and that's absolutely stuff that Harry Brown was very, very much thinking about when
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   he designed this.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.440]   I mean, this is really an investment strategy that is designed for a world of fiat currencies.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.160]   And when Harry Brown, I mean, he made his money on betting against the American dollar,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.320]   on betting about the American dollar being devalued when it went off the last remnants
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.000]   of the semi-gold standard in the early '70s.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.720]   That's actually how Harry Brown made his fortune.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.840]   This is the funny thing is that he was a speculator.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.760]   He actually lucked out, so to speak, in terms of his timing to a certain degree.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.680]   But he also saw enough of what's going on in the market to realize that you can't find
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.960]   opportunities to time the market like the way that he did in the early '70s with gold.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.680]   So yeah, he was very much aware of the problems of fiat currencies that we've had since the
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.640]   early 1970s.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.480]   And there are lots and lots of people who look at fiat currencies and look at the ability
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   that banks have to just type new zeros into their accounts in a way that if you or I did
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   that, it would be fraud and it would be unbelievable to anyone that we could be taken seriously.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   It's such an obvious crime.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.540]   But central banks can do that, and that's just the way that it works.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.400]   And Harry Brown was very, very aware of the negative effects that that can have on the
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.200]   business cycle.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:39.720]   But the difference is that whereas there are some people who look at fiat currencies and
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.640]   look at what central banks can do, what the banksters can do, as they're called, and they
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:53.200]   say, right, I'm going to invest all my money into hard assets because any day now, the
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.800]   West is just going to crumble and we're going to have a total meltdown, hyperinflation.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.840]   It'll be like Germany in the 1920s.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:09.760]   And the thing is that I can understand that mathematically, you know, the ever-increasing
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   government debt and so forth, that something's got to give at some point.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:21.760]   But there is no way to see whether or not that's going to be this year, next year, or
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.680]   whether or not something will happen in the energy sector that will suddenly give a new
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:32.200]   boost to the economy and so forth, or whether or not we could go into a sort of moribund
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:40.640]   phase of very, very low economic activity, a bit like what happened to Japan in the '90s.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.280]   So you just can't tell.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.800]   And the good thing about the permanent portfolio is that, you know, whereas sometimes people
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   who focus just on stocks just kind of, in a sense, don't think about the risks of hyperinflation
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.040]   and the kind of problems that stocks had in the '70s, it takes that into account.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:09.400]   But it also is realistic enough to say, yeah, the currency could be seriously devalued,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.360]   there could be some kind of economic meltdown, but there might not be.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:21.080]   So best to be in a situation where you don't have to be sort of thinking that you haven't
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.880]   put all your eggs in one basket, basically.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.360]   And the danger is, if you think there's going to be an economic meltdown, you're going to
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.520]   start seeing confirmation bias, and you're going to start reading the news and say, oh,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.400]   look, look, there's the first signs of it.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:38.440]   And you start having this kind of doom mentality, where everything looks like the economy's
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.000]   about to totally melt down.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.640]   And I mean, it really looked like that in 2008.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.520]   And then who would have thought that one of the asset classes that would do really well
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:54.280]   in the years following 2008 would have been long-term treasuries, as they did in 2011.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.360]   It was one of the asset classes that carried the portfolio.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:05.240]   That's not something that anybody who expected meltdown was talking about before.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.080]   And they were all talking about getting your money out of currency and into precious metals.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.440]   And funnily enough, since then, gold has actually gone down.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.200]   So you just can't tell what's going to happen.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.400]   And so that's why this approach is the one I like.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.760]   Because the other thing is, I don't want to have a new job as a full-time investor.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:29.200]   I want to live life and enjoy myself and get out there and do fun things that I find fulfilling.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   I don't want to have to be reading financial news all the time.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.640]   And I don't want to have to be worrying about whether or not my investment strategy is vulnerable
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.400]   to the latest problems in the economy or government actions.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.000]   And this is the great thing about the permanent portfolio approach.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.240]   I very rarely check my portfolio these days.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.520]   When I first started investing, I checked it every single day.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.640]   And then I started checking it every week or so.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.080]   And then I started checking it every month.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.040]   And now I check it probably every quarter, because I actually have an action to update
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.200]   my portfolio once a quarter.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.680]   So I consciously check it, but I don't check it every day.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.760]   So my problem with it, and I'm interested in what your thoughts are about this, is that
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.360]   I recognize the beauty of the design.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:22.080]   I recognize the beauty of, like you said, just the ability to read the newspaper and
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   not worry about it.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.400]   You know, to say, "Well, okay, I'm pretty well covered no matter what that is."
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:36.840]   But the problem is that I'm one of these guys where I would just be so uncomfortable owning
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.600]   that much gold.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:52.240]   And the problem is that this portfolio is designed to provide for somebody who is -- the
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.960]   portfolio is designed to take advantage of the changes in economics and the economic
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   cycle and the business cycle.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.240]   But when I look at it, I look at it and say, "Okay, cash, if I'm allowed to take cash out
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.560]   and I'm allowed to use cash for my own purposes, then it's smart for me to have cash."
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.960]   But usually when I assess an allocation in an investment portfolio, for me to have 25
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.400]   percent of an investment portfolio in cash, unless I'm counting personal reserves, cash
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.760]   reserves, emergency funds, opportunity funds, things like that, if I'm trying to keep some
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.040]   cash in case I stumble across a good investment opportunity, I usually wouldn't count that.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.160]   So for me to say I'm going to keep 25 percent of the portfolio in cash, that's a little
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.640]   hard to stomach.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:45.040]   Then to say I'm going to buy gold, and to me, 4,000 years of economic history notwithstanding,
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.520]   basically if I buy gold coins, I'm buying something that the only thing that contributes
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.680]   to the price is supply and demand.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.760]   And so the only thing that drives the price of the gold is supply and demand.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.000]   There's no intrinsic value to it.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.440]   All the people may disagree with me, but what am I going to do with a brick of gold sitting
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.920]   in my living room?
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.040]   There's maybe a value to it from a jewelry perspective in other cultures, in India or
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.760]   China where they actually use gold jewelry, but I don't own any gold jewelry.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   I don't wear it.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.840]   I'd be swindled in an instant if I were trying to buy or sell gold jewelry.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.400]   So the only thing that it's driven by is supply and demand.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.880]   And then bonds, I get so uncomfortable about the movement of that.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.280]   I get so uncomfortable about the change in value as interest rates adjust, and plus I
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.640]   just don't see any value for them for me.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:45.920]   So I would feel more comfortable owning shares of 10 great companies.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   I'd feel more comfortable if I had a $100,000 portfolio or a million dollar portfolio, whatever
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.280]   the number was, I'd feel more comfortable just owning one company, Coca-Cola stock or
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.920]   Walmart stock or Exxon or something like that.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.160]   And I would diversify probably into more than one company, but if I had 10 companies, I
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.760]   would feel more comfortable with the ability of those companies to get through an economic
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   crisis and readjust.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   And so I'd be curious if you comment on that.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.240]   Yeah, I'll comment on, because you said a few things there.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.520]   So let's talk about gold first.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.560]   And this is definitely one of the assets that a lot of people, especially if they haven't
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   invested in precious metals before, think like, why would I want 25% of my portfolio
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   in gold?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   Firstly, I mean, I think it's worth backtesting.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.120]   It's always worth looking.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.760]   What are you going to use to make these decisions?
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.840]   One of the things that's interesting is the empirical evidence.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.480]   And gold has played a really important part in the portfolio a few times.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.200]   And it's played a really important part in the times when everyone else was toast.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.040]   One of the interesting things is the 1970s and the 2000s, if you were all in stocks,
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.320]   you would have had a really bad time.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.840]   And funnily enough, the only time that I would have really-- I mean, I'm not a speculator,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.980]   but if I could use the knowledge of the future and we went back to 2000, I would be fully
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.980]   in gold.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.440]   And I'd ride that decade out in gold, because it was an amazing decade for gold.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.420]   Really, really strong growth.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.080]   On the other hand, in the 1980s and the 1990s, it was a really bad time for gold.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.600]   So there is that.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.920]   You've got to look at the evidence of what's actually happened.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.560]   And the interesting thing is that in times when your favorite asset class, if you like,
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.480]   the stocks, would have done really badly, gold did really well.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.400]   But the other thing about gold-- and this is a very interesting thing-- it's actually
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.420]   the non-paper asset in the portfolio.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:47.040]   And there is something about this part of the permanent portfolio that is really, really
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   helpful and useful.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.680]   And that is it has a certain amount of asset protection built in.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:59.040]   Because the idea is that all your paper assets are vulnerable to the black swan event of
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   who knows what happens.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   There's some kind of civil unrest.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.360]   There's-- I don't know-- the government goes crazy.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.680]   In the 20th century, bad things happened in Europe many, many times.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.000]   And the government suddenly turned it into totalitarian regimes in Germany.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.560]   And really bad stuff can happen.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   And when that does happen, paper assets are risky.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.840]   Because you may not get your money back.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.160]   And you may not even retain ownership.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.280]   And one of the interesting things about the permanent portfolio is that you hold gold.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   And the recommendation is that you hold it outside your country of origin.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.720]   And the idea with that is that if something really weird happens-- let's say that there's
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.440]   some kind of terrible civil unrest or things get really bad-- then you have physical assets
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.680]   that are not paper assets.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:54.780]   And that's-- even in the case of a kind of really unusual black swan meltdown event,
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.200]   you still have an asset that is physical, tangible.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   And yeah, you're right.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   It's based on supply and demand.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.840]   But it's considered precious by humans.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.680]   And it has been for thousands of years.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.200]   And it may-- who knows?
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.460]   There's no guarantees with the permanent portfolio.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:20.860]   This could stop working if suddenly there was some other way of creating gold.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.520]   Or if suddenly Bitcoin really takes off and people don't need gold anymore.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.600]   There's lots of things that could happen.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.280]   But that's one of the reasons, I think, that it's really useful to have gold.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.160]   Because from all the evidence that we have of the past, it's a very useful asset for
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.600]   certain periods in the economic cycle when other assets do really badly.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.920]   Nothing else has held up in periods of really strong inflation and negative real interest
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.440]   rates in the way that gold has.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.320]   And stocks haven't.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.600]   And obviously, neither has cash and bonds.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.040]   But gold has.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.840]   And not only that, you get that kind of built-in asset protection.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.360]   And you said some stuff about bonds.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   But does that-- before getting onto that, does that sort of answer your question about
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   gold?
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Yeah, it does.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.160]   And what you said about portable money makes all the sense in the world to me.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.560]   So I'm very sympathetic to that.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.640]   And I'll give you a couple examples.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.720]   I live in Florida.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.980]   We have hurricanes.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.520]   And so I've always thought it was important.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:26.160]   I've told clients and told people in the past, make sure you have some cash with dollar bills
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.640]   that's not that you can get at in case there's a hurricane coming and the ATM is out of money.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.040]   I feel the same way about gold.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.600]   Now, this would be dependent upon where somebody is.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.200]   But as far as where they are in the wealth building, if you've got $1,000 to your name,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.520]   it's probably not a good idea.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.760]   I wouldn't say go buy gold coins with $250 of it, because you're going to need that money
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.360]   to do something else that's more tangible.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.940]   But if you're in the phase of your wealth building where you've built wealth, then having
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:57.800]   some gold coins on hand where you can get to them or outside of the country, put it
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.560]   this way, the Jews that got out of Germany were probably those who could buy their way
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.960]   out.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.320]   And you can walk into any country in the world and a couple of gold American Eagles or Kruger
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.520]   Rands or whatever it is that you have, and you can get done what you need to get done.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.400]   And it seems smart for me, for somebody who has wealth, you never know when something
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   could happen.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.080]   You never know when a government could go crazy.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:26.940]   You never know when you might be sued into oblivion completely out of the blue.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.940]   You never know when you might be accused of a crime that you didn't commit.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.420]   And so it seems intelligent for me to build backup plans.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.580]   And gold coins, I mean, there's not a more tangible intent -- what's the word?
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:47.620]   Meaning there's not a more tangible, compact way to move large amounts of wealth than with
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.620]   gold coins.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.280]   It just makes all the sense in the world to me.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.520]   It's just when I come to thinking about it from a portfolio perspective and saying, "Ugh,
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.960]   25%" -- and here would be the other thing.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.260]   What do I want this portfolio to do for me?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.300]   Is this a portfolio that's going to be my wealth that I just want to make sure is always
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   there?
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.560]   Or is this a portfolio that's going to support me?
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:14.380]   And I'm kind of close as far as how much I can pull off the portfolio based upon my numbers.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:19.760]   And I want you to go on to bonds, but this is why, for me, the thing that annoys me about
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.420]   most financial conversations is the answer is it's personal.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   It's personal.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.280]   I'm at one stage of my wealth building.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.660]   You're at another stage of your wealth building.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.620]   You've built a company and sold it and traveled the world.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.400]   I have not yet done that.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.640]   So the financial advice for me is going to be very different than the financial advice
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.800]   for you.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.920]   And that's where this approach to the permanent portfolio may be perfect.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.580]   Like we said in the beginning, it may be perfect for one person and may be absolutely the worst
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.160]   advice in the world for the second person.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.680]   So it's intensely personal.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   But I agree with you.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.200]   What you say makes all the sense in the world about gold from that perspective.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   So I get it.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.160]   Keep going on the bonds or feel free to respond.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.860]   I mean, just another quick thing on gold.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.920]   You mentioned what would happen if you were Jewish in Nazi Germany and trying to escape.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.800]   But also think of like, what if you had some means in Russia before the revolution?
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.040]   Let's say that you owned a factory and you owned a business or whatever.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.280]   If you fled, that's it.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.920]   If you had some money in the stock exchange in Russia, that would have been it.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.520]   That would have been all gone.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.800]   But if you had kept some gold abroad, then you would have had something to go to.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:37.980]   And the same if you were trying to escape from fascist Germany or any of the other crazy
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.600]   regimes that have sprung up in the last 200 years.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:50.040]   So I think that's the key thing, is that it offers a protection against the events that
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:56.440]   you don't have to worry about happening and plan for going to live in the woods.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.640]   Because even if the worst things happen, then you still actually have a really good built-in
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.120]   protection for those type of events.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.280]   But you don't have to devote your life to it in terms of becoming a survivalist and
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.680]   changing your whole lifestyle just in case the world falls apart tomorrow.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.320]   So that's the gold part.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.880]   And hyperinflation is definitely something that happens all the time.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.840]   Currencies devalue to nothing all the time.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.600]   It's happened very recently in Zimbabwe.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.280]   I've actually got some Zimbabwean currency on my wall behind me.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:39.640]   I'm just looking and so I am a 100 trillionaire from the currency.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   That's worthless.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.360]   And that's just one example that can happen to any currency.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.560]   So that's what gold protects you for.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   The thing about bonds...
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.960]   Real quick before you go on to bonds, I want to make another comment.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.840]   The stuff we're talking about with gold coins, and then I'm going to go on to cash, and we
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.440]   can go on to bonds, but this is the stuff that I wish more people spent time thinking
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.680]   about from the perspective of their own financial plans.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.920]   Because for the exact same reasons you said why gold can be a valuable asset class for
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:19.240]   people to consider, I'm going to skip ahead of bonds and go to cash.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.360]   I was just speaking with somebody recently, and this person is fairly wealthy, and they
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:31.080]   made a comment that they keep several tens of thousands of dollars of cash at home in
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.080]   physical bills that they can physically access.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.720]   And the reason, they said, was because that's how you get a deal, is that just the opportunity.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   You're driving down the road, somebody's selling a boat or a car, someone's selling a car for
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.480]   20 grand, but you can walk up to them and say, "Listen, I'll give you 10, and I'll give
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   it to you right now."
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:43:01.800]   The ability to get your hands on 10,000 bucks, to be able to buy a car at half price, is
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.480]   going to make a much bigger difference in your personal financial plan than is the fact
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:12.840]   that your large cap, you know, gross stock portfolio grew at 11% this year.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.800]   You're going to get a lot more of a savings from the half-priced car.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.520]   And so the key is to view these things as integrated.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.140]   So if we can, you know, if the gold can be, "Okay, I've got this plan in place.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   If this happens, and hey, if the prices go up, that'd be great.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.360]   If this protects me and my portfolio, and I can view this comprehensively, that's awesome."
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.960]   And if the cash is cash that's sitting on the reserve, you know, it's dry powder in
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.860]   case of starting a business, or it's money so that you can make that real estate deal
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:45.760]   when the widow next door is selling the house, and you've got the cash to do it, I think
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.640]   that would be permitted and would be a really valuable part of having these asset classes
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   available.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.880]   Viewing this as comprehensively, you know, viewing this as comprehensively and not just
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.240]   saying, "Well, my mutual fund is going to give me a 10% return, so that's going to make
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.600]   all my wealth."
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   No.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.440]   All the wealthy people that I've talked to and worked with, there's usually some of this
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.720]   wheeling and dealing when they see an opportunity, as in the house next door is going to go on
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.520]   the market, but if I make them a cash offer, and I can give a $20,000 down payment, right
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.960]   now I can get it for substantially below market and figure out the financing later, you've
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   got an opportunity.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   So, go ahead.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   Yeah, just on cash.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   Just on cash.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.160]   So, it's certainly true that, I mean, I'll give you an example of the way that this has
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.400]   worked for me.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:41.280]   So, shortly after I really got into investing, the stock market crashed in 2008, and the
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   price of shares dropped really significantly in the UK, and as they did in the States and
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   so forth.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:53.920]   And so, I then rebalanced following, in I think early, I can't remember exactly, but
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:45:01.480]   I think it was early 2009, when the price was very low, and I was able to do that because
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   I had cash.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:08.440]   Obviously, I don't keep the cash, I actually do keep short-term treasuries, so you don't
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:14.480]   actually have to literally keep cash, you can put it into short-term treasuries and
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.840]   get some interest on it, although admittedly, these days, it's not enough.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.320]   Your friend who actually carries that amount of cash around, that's a little bit racy for
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   my blood.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.480]   I wouldn't really want to be carrying big bags of cash around.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.280]   But nonetheless, the point being that you can get it out of the bank or out from your
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.680]   investment broker without incurring capital gain, because it's not, you know, if you're
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.360]   all locked up in assets, then if an opportunity comes along and you have to sell something,
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:53.440]   you know, you can incur capital gain tax liabilities because you're rebalancing, whereas if you
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:00.200]   have cash, then you have a lot of flexibility to react when you need to rebalance, because
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.960]   you have that significant part of the portfolio that is cash.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:11.520]   And as you said, you know, you also need to have cash available for emergencies, for stuff
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.360]   to happen and so forth, and for me, that's all part of the cash allocation.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:24.840]   So you can -- basically, you can put it into short-term treasuries or short-term gilts,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.880]   as they're called in this country, and get some interest on them, and also that gives
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.440]   you a certain amount of additional protection from holding it in a bank, because the problem
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:41.480]   is that the bank actually, you know, essentially, you're only guaranteed up to a certain amount
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.840]   by the government, and the bank actually takes ownership of your cash when it's not your
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.720]   cash when you have it in a bank account.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.480]   So you're lucky to get it back.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.080]   If the bank has problems, you may not do.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   It's a little different if you hold it in gilts with a broker, because then it doesn't
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:02.560]   quite fall under the same situation as cash being transferred into their ownership.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.360]   It doesn't make it 100% safe, but it's safer than putting money directly into a bank.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:14.200]   And that's another of the sort of protection mechanisms built into the permanent portfolio
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.520]   that I think are really interesting.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:23.160]   Harry Brown was very aware of the problem of banks collapsing, and he was -- you know,
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   he really looked carefully at what are you going to do if that happens?
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.160]   How will that affect you?
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.600]   And so he actually advises not to keep money in literal cash in a bank, but to put it into
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.760]   short-term treasuries and hold it in that form.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   Right.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.680]   And that's -- I love that method of thinking.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.000]   I love the redundancy, the redundancy, the redundancy.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.440]   To me, a well-built financial plan takes into account as many of these things as possible
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.240]   in a way that's appropriate to an individual.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.380]   So you can get to the point where, you know, there are many ways -- there might be many
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.400]   ways that you would have cash.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.920]   You may keep $100 in your wallet or 100 pounds in your wallet.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.160]   You may keep 1,000 bucks at home.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:13.560]   You may keep a little bit of money in a hidden away somewhere, and then you may keep some
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.440]   of it in the bank for ease.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.640]   You may keep some of it with your broker so that you can quickly rebalance the portfolio
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.360]   in some kind of cash account there, and you may keep some direct with the treasury in
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.680]   T-bills.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.440]   And you may diversify some -- you know, that's what I love about this way of thinking is
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.640]   when you plan, as Harry Brown did, when you plan for the doomsday scenarios, it brings
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:40.680]   such a strength -- it can bring such a strength into your portfolio that your financial plan,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.760]   if everything goes perfectly well, your financial plan is in great shape.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.440]   And then if everything goes crazy, your financial plan is in great shape.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.160]   And the likelihood is it's probably somewhere between those two extremes.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.720]   It's probably not a black swan event and probably not all peaches and roses.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:01.400]   And so then you're well taken care of so that you can continue your lifestyle, you know,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   no matter what happens.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   >>Yeah.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.720]   And you know, there are definitely some people who would look at some of these scenarios
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.800]   and think like, "Oh, that's not going to happen.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.960]   I'm not worried about, you know, civil unrest.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.360]   I'm not worried about the banks going under.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:19.560]   I'm not worried about some kind of crazy economic meltdown."
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.720]   >>Look what happened in London a couple years ago, right?
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.360]   >>Yeah, but the point I would make is, the point I would make is, this approach may not
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   be for them.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.600]   You know, if you really don't -- obviously, I personally think that, you know, even if
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.880]   I'm not particularly -- even if I don't rate the likelihood of any of these things happening
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:41.600]   to be particularly high, I just really enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that I'm prepared
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   for any economic condition.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.480]   And that gives me a lot of peace of mind.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.000]   Some people might say, "I'd rather not be prepared for any economic condition because
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.440]   I rate the probability so low, and I'm just going to bet everything on stocks because
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.840]   I think that's going to give me the biggest return, or I've got another favorite asset
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.440]   class, or I've got a particular speculation.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.080]   I'm going to throw all my money into that," and so forth.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.360]   There are people who do that, right?
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.840]   And this approach wouldn't be right for them.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:11.560]   They wouldn't -- you know, this definitely -- there's -- if you're trying to even out
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:18.240]   volatility and you're trying to limit catastrophic risk as much as you can, which is what the
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.760]   permanent portfolio is all about, then you're going to miss out on some big wins, which
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.240]   is the cost of, you know, missing out on the big losses as well.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.720]   And so that's definitely what -- who this approach is going to appeal to more, is people
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.800]   who are considering their investments as being something that they want to keep safe and
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.160]   that they want to be able to keep ahead of inflation with and give them, you know, a
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.680]   return that the market can give them.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.040]   Then they're not trying to beat the market.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.720]   That's what this approach is all about, whereas other people might think that they can beat
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.200]   the market and they might have a totally different approach.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.760]   And so it really depends on your philosophy and your approach.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.800]   Well said.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.960]   You had some comments about bonds, because I'm not a bond lover.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.200]   I'm going to -- at some point on this show, I'm going to have some bond traders and bond
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.000]   managers on, because I do think it's a useful asset class, but you had some comments you
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.400]   wanted to make about bonds.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.240]   Well, I mean, the thing about bonds is -- the way I think about bonds is that, again, this
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.040]   is a portfolio that's been designed for a world in which central banks can just change
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.760]   the interest rate by manipulating the bond market, essentially, is the way that they
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.080]   do it.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.400]   And what that means is that you can be -- all of a sudden, you know, the interest rate can
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.960]   just be totally changed on you, and that can have huge effects on your savings and so forth.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:48.720]   But the interesting thing about long-term bonds is that the longer the length of the
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.960]   duration of the bond, the more they respond to interest rate changes.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.000]   And that's actually what Harry Brown was designing in.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.920]   And the reason for that is that, you know, what happens if the interest rate drops or
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:11.160]   is pushed down, as it does and is held down in times of sort of economic depression, then
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.680]   the capital value of long-term bonds goes up, because the market overall is giving you
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.560]   a smaller return, individual return on investment, so a smaller percentage.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.440]   Therefore, if you hold a fixed-interest bond with a higher interest, then the capital value
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.300]   of that bond goes up.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:36.840]   So you are essentially kind of hedging yourself against what could happen in any scenario
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:42.520]   with the currency, basically, with manipulation of interest rates.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:48.400]   If there's a tight money recession, then you have a large proportion of your money in cash,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.720]   and the interest rates are going to shoot up, and you're going to be able to be benefiting
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.040]   from that, even though it's going to damage the capital value of your long-term bonds.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.220]   But if the other thing happens and interest rates are held down, capital value of your
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.160]   long-term bonds goes up.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:10.560]   So this is sort of -- and the interesting thing is that there's something called bond
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:17.200]   convexity, which is like basically the lower interest rates get, then the more effect that
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.300]   a little push on interest rates has on that capital value, too.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.840]   So basically, that's the idea behind why the bonds are in there.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:32.560]   They're to protect you in any economic circumstance, and there are some conditions, particularly
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.980]   like a long-term sort of depression-type thing, where bonds have been basically the best asset
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.540]   to hold.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.820]   So yeah, that's basically the rationale behind that part of the portfolio.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.960]   And they give you some income.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:51.720]   Not a lot in the moment, it has to be said, but they're another interest-producing asset.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:56.880]   >>Did he ever talk about how to keep the duration of the portfolio long?
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:05.920]   So for example, did he -- so he recommended holding long-term national bonds.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.960]   So in the U.S., that would be U.S. Treasury bonds.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:19.600]   And the idea is eliminate the risk -- eliminate the repayment risk, eliminate creditor risk
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:26.480]   by not buying corporate bonds, and then buy long-term U.S. Treasuries, about 30-year terms,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.640]   so that you have a very long-duration bond so that it will be very sensitive to interest
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   rates.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:39.040]   But did he ever talk through practically what the -- if your duration starts to get shorter,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:44.320]   or if your duration starts to get to 25 years, 20 years, at some point in time, you're supposed
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   to lengthen your duration?
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.640]   Do you know of anything about that?
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:53.040]   >>Yeah, I mean, you can apply the permanent portfolio to basically any country.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.840]   And so I happen to be in the U.K., and it will be different in the States and so forth.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.880]   But I mean, the basic idea is get the longest bonds that you can get, get fixed interest
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.000]   and the longest bonds that you can get, if you're pursuing the strategy, obviously, of
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.200]   the permanent portfolio.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.720]   And then if, you know, after a while, if it starts to get too short, then you just sell
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.940]   them and get longer ones again.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.800]   And so for the long-term bonds, it's fairly straightforward.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.400]   You just -- if the duration starts -- I mean, I haven't been investing that long that it's
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.520]   really going to make a huge difference.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:32.920]   But if it starts to get too close to a shorter term, then you just sell those and buy the
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.960]   treasuries or the gilts that are currently available at the longest term.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.640]   For short-term bonds, for the cash element, it's a little different.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.160]   And you build basically a ladder.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:50.120]   So the way that you do that is you buy a few that mature in a year -- sorry, you buy a
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.280]   certain proportion that mature in a year and then another proportion that matures in two
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.960]   years and then three years.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.680]   And some people go a bit further out, like maybe four or five.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.560]   But with the cash element, it needs to be relatively short periods.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:08.880]   And then you just -- when one set of bonds matures, you then just buy at the top of your
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.960]   little time ladder of three to five years again.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.840]   So you just keep cycling through in that way.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.400]   With the long bonds, it's really straightforward.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   You just don't do anything.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.280]   You just buy the longest term that you can.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.640]   You let them sit there.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:26.040]   And then maybe after 10 years or so or whatever, you sell them and buy another really long
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   set.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   >>Right.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   Right.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.120]   Do you know anything -- do you remember or have any knowledge of what the actual returns
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.760]   would have been for this portfolio?
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.000]   >>Well, I'm based in the U.K.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.880]   So I did my own back testing.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:50.280]   And before I got into investing -- and I think I did that for 10 years -- I don't remember
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   now because it was way -- I think it was like 2005.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.820]   And I tested it back for the 10 years previously.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.860]   And it was just under 10%, I think, was the nominal return.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.200]   And it was ahead of -- keeping ahead of inflation as well.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.720]   So comfortably ahead of inflation with 10% nominal.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.880]   Obviously less inflation adjusted.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.360]   And that, I think, is -- I mean, you can look this up on Craig Rowland's site.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.560]   Craig's written a great book about the permanent portfolio.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.040]   And his site is crawlingroad.com, I think.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:32.160]   And he has a whole series of data for the American permanent portfolio.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.120]   And I'm really speaking from memory here.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.200]   But I think it's somewhere in the range of 8 to 10% nominal.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:45.840]   And then that means inflation adjusted, you're still maybe 2 or 3% ahead of inflation.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.560]   So basically, you know, it keeps up with inflation.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.640]   It gives you a relatively decent return.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:00.840]   But it doesn't give you the same volatility that you get from being invested in one individual
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.200]   asset class.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.120]   But as I say, if you want the exact numbers, I don't have them off the top of my head.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.840]   You have to have a look for American ones on his site.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.600]   Yeah, that's about what I remembered.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.840]   And I'll check that out.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.600]   It doesn't give you the same returns.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.160]   And it'll be interesting to see, you know, in the world that we live in.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.560]   That's the thing with investment, is you never -- it's easy to look back and say, this is
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.560]   what this has done historically.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.680]   But you know, there may be many reasons for that.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   And I like this strategy.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.880]   I think it's a well-built strategy to try to understand what the reasons may be.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.880]   It'll be interesting to --
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.440]   >>Sorry, there's one more thing I was just going to add to that.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:44.200]   The key thing is also that it hasn't had the catastrophic losses that stocks have suffered
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.600]   when the business cycle turns.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.840]   That's the interesting thing about the permanent portfolio, is it doesn't give you super big
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.840]   growth.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.840]   It gives you a decent growth.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.440]   But it doesn't give you super catastrophic losses.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:59:03.400]   There's been a couple of years when you've had losses more than 5%, I think.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   But most years, there's really very little loss.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.960]   Again, have a look at the actual data for America, because I can't remember it.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.600]   But Craig's got it all on his website.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   >>Right.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.680]   And that's -- to me -- and feel free to comment on this.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:25.920]   But that's one of the ones where -- that's an example of some of the things that -- where
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.240]   individual investors' temperament and individual investors' situation is so important.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.040]   If I woke up tomorrow and stocks had declined in value by 50%, I would be thrilled.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.680]   Because what that would say is, unless there was some structural thing that had occurred
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.960]   overnight, I can get a major discount.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.560]   And then the only way to experience the loss is if I sell.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:53.600]   So if I have the stomach for that, to sit through the losses, yes, the gains do have
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   to come back.
[00:59:54.600 --> 01:00:00.080]   So if you have a 50% loss in one year, you have to have far more than a 50% increase
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.440]   to bring the values back.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.800]   But I have the -- but if I have the stomach for it, I can sit through it.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.720]   If I don't have the stomach for it, then I need to make sure that my strategy is one
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.880]   that's going to allow me to not -- that's going to allow me to get through that.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.080]   And that's one of the things that's always -- it's kind of a struggle getting back through
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:28.840]   -- coming out on this side instead of being in the investment advisor space where -- I'm
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.400]   not sure exactly what I'm trying to express, but just that losses -- you only lock in your
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.900]   losses if you sell.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.280]   And so the key is to avoid the need to ever sell during a loss period.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.360]   And to me, the way that you accomplish that is -- the way that you accomplish that is
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.440]   with good financial planning and good cash flow planning and good anticipating what the
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.960]   needs would be.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.360]   And so it may be perfectly fine to have a very speculative portfolio if there's no
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.560]   need for the cash and you know that I can allow this portfolio to sit out here and wander
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.920]   around in value for the next 10 years and I don't need to pull money from it.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   It's a very different thing than if I'm 70 years old and I'm systematically liquidating
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.720]   5% of my portfolio.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.360]   Well now in this -- and I don't have any cash reserves -- now the losses could be devastating
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360]   to me.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   >>Can I comment on that?
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   >>Go ahead.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   Feel free.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.440]   >>Yeah, because I think that there's some really interesting things there.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.680]   First of all, you're absolutely right that -- I've talked to a lot of people who invest
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.320]   solely in stocks.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.480]   And their attitude is, "I don't really care if there's 10 years of rough going because
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.160]   then there's going to be some times where it's going to be super boom times and they
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.480]   will more than make up for it in the very long term."
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.160]   And I think in the very long term, you know, with stocks, that -- the evidence seems to
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.520]   support that, right?
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.200]   But 10 years is a long time for me.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.360]   I don't want to see my portfolio lose money for 10 years.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.920]   And I'm not -- I don't have the stomach also for an overnight 50% drop.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.200]   I don't want to see that.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.040]   And that's partly because of my -- I'm actually quite -- I'm a conservative investor in the
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:20.240]   sense that I focused on entrepreneurship as a way of creating my wealth.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.520]   And the investment for me, I want that to be safe.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:31.600]   I want that to give me a decent return given what the market can bear, so to speak.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.560]   And I want to be able to get on with my life and do other things.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.240]   Other people have a totally different approach.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.400]   They are -- as you say, I mean, if you're early on in your investments and you really
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.800]   want to get into stocks, then if the prices fall significantly, then it's buying time.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   And that's great.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.240]   The one thing I would disagree with you on, or that I've never been able to get behind
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.320]   that idea that, you know, you only lock in losses if you sell.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:04.400]   Because I view the portfolio at any specific time -- people say this about their houses
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.760]   as well when they consider their houses to be investments, even though the house that
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.000]   you live in is a consumption item, not an investment.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.520]   But if the property value falls, they think, well, I'll only actually lock in the loss
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   if I sell.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.400]   But in any investment, the way I think about it is, like, you know, at any particular moment
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   in time, your portfolio is worth what your portfolio is worth.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.320]   And just because you don't sell it, it doesn't change the fact that you've just effectively
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.560]   had a huge opportunity loss if you're in a stock that's fallen.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.080]   That's value that's gone, right?
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:44.040]   So although I understand the approach, I view it from the perspective of I don't want to
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.680]   experience those catastrophic losses because I want to just get on with focusing on the
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   rest of my life.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.920]   I don't want to be an investor all day, every day, and worry about it.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.680]   And psychologically, it's certainly true that losses -- just from the way that we're built,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.640]   evolution has made losses hit us harder than gains cheer us up, if you see what I mean.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.360]   People psychologically suffer more.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.600]   And you can psych yourself out of that in some ways and rationalize your way out of
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   that.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.500]   But to a certain degree, it affects everyone.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.080]   And so I don't want to experience that.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:26.720]   But also, it seems to me like the attitude that, well, even if stocks do badly for multiple
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.640]   years, they'll pick up in the end, I can't get behind that because I kind of think, yeah,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.160]   but you just had 10 years of bad losses.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.920]   That doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.840]   Or not bad losses, but 10 years not keeping up with inflation.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.600]   And that to me, that's a real loss.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.400]   Even if you haven't sold, the value is still lower.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.800]   >>Right, and I think -- and it's a good question.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.320]   And if you don't mind, let's just stop here and talk about it for a minute.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   Because these are the kinds of questions that I think many people have.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.400]   And I'll give you my answer.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.920]   And I think that -- and I'm interested in your thoughts.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.280]   I think where this comes from, you are 100% right about all of the behavioral evidence
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.920]   that I have read points to the fact that losses are -- we feel losses substantially more than
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.200]   we enjoy gains.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.400]   We feel the pain of losses substantially more than we enjoy gains.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.280]   And so we're very loss-averse as individuals.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.080]   The problem comes down to how well do we know what we're investing in.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.680]   So if we use terms like stocks, which are useful for the purpose of this conversation,
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.960]   if we use terms like stocks, that's a very general term.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   That's something where we don't actually know what we're referring to.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.320]   We don't know whether we're referring to a group of three companies or we're referring
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.760]   to a total market in general in a conversation like this.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   You and I are referring to just the general stock market as measured by something like
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:05.680]   a total stock market index or a major -- an S&P 500 index, something like that, or a European
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.440]   index -- we'll pick one of the European indexes.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   And here would be the example.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.800]   >>Just to be clear, and that is -- and when I say stocks, that is actually the approach
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.800]   to permanent portfolio.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.880]   It is an index fund-based approach that you go for total market.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.360]   There's no speculation on individual stocks.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   So sorry, but carry on.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.280]   But that's -- when I say stocks, that's what I mean.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   >>Perfect.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.720]   So under the total -- so to me -- let me use two different examples.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.720]   So under the total market scenario, you don't really know what you own except for the fact
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.860]   that you own all of the companies.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:42.360]   And so in that scenario, what you're essentially -- under this investing philosophy, you're
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:51.160]   basically assuming that over time, good companies will always grow in value.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.560]   Because if they're not growing in value, then their shareholders, their board of directors
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.360]   are gonna replace the company management and they're gonna figure out how to grow in value.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.640]   Companies just don't sit around and do nothing.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   They're not just flat.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:11.000]   They have to be growing, which leads into the perpetual growth conversation.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.660]   But companies have to be growing over time.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:19.440]   And so we're assuming that the market is efficiently priced.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.280]   We're assuming that there's lots of players.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:26.360]   And so every individual's company stock price is an accurate reflection of that company's
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   value.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.600]   And as such, the prices on the whole of the general stock market is an accurate reflection
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.580]   of the value of all of these companies.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.280]   And so if those prices are going up and down in value, it's because there's some other
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.040]   ancillary, there's some reason for it.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.780]   Now the example -- and that's a rational approach.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:50.120]   But if you were back running your company, doing pedestrian consulting, and I don't know
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.000]   what you sold your company for, so let me just make up some numbers.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.160]   And let's just say one day you were sitting down looking at your assets on the company
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:02.080]   balance sheet and you were saying, "I think this company is worth at least $100,000."
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:08.040]   And if I came in and offered you $40,000 one day and then $140,000 the next day, and then
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.640]   came in and offered you $40,000 the next day, that wouldn't necessarily affect how you -- the
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.160]   actual value of the company.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.160]   That would just affect the price of the company.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:22.400]   And so you probably wouldn't lose that much sleep over the offer that I had made you.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.880]   'Cause I'm clearly a schizophrenic investor if I'm offering you these two very different
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.140]   -- two very different values.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:34.600]   And so this is where I think you have an advantage if you're not in the total market world.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.640]   If you are someone where -- let's say that you were managing the Walton Family Foundation
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.400]   and as such you had hundreds of millions of dollars of Walmart shares.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.320]   Just because Walmart shares decline in value by 30 or 40 percent overnight doesn't mean
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.960]   that necessarily the value of Walmart is affected by that 30 or 40 percent.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.120]   But that's where you have an intuitive connection to the company.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.680]   Now if you don't have an intuitive connection to the company where you just have this general
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:07.840]   asset class called stocks, then it really is concerning.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.540]   And so most people don't know what companies they actually own.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:17.480]   Most people don't know what -- they don't know what companies they're actually invested
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   in.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   Like we just simply don't know.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.580]   And because we don't know, we can't feel comfortable of the fact that even though the price that's
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.280]   being offered today has declined, that the value of this company is still good.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   Or we don't know that, hey, the value of this company just got destroyed because -- I posted
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.660]   a link on Twitter the other day about Blockbuster -- all the traders betting on Blockbuster
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.560]   ten years ago when Netflix was coming out.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.240]   So I guess what I'm trying to say to wrap up and let you respond is I don't know how
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.800]   to solve this problem.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.200]   And I've struggled with this mentally for a while.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   Excuse me.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.920]   That's thunder outside if you can hear that.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.040]   I've struggled with this -- it wasn't a gunshot.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.900]   It was pretty close thunderclap.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:01.760]   I've struggled with this problem trying to figure out how do we solve this problem.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.620]   Because there's very little connection for people -- the connection that you had as an
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.780]   entrepreneur to your company, you don't have with the stocks in your portfolio.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.900]   So you're viewing -- most people, you may not be, but most people are viewing the stocks
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:20.140]   in their portfolio very differently than how they view their own company.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.380]   And that's why then people are much more likely to bail all of a sudden.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.780]   Whereas if your house -- and that's why people will sit through their house and they'll take
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:32.460]   the point of, well, my house declined in cost by 50% because they'll say, well, it's my
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   house.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.300]   It's where I live.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.920]   So I feel like I'm being a little bit wordy.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   So I'll shut up and let you respond.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.440]   But I just haven't figured out how to solve this problem of connecting people to the assets
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.780]   that they actually own.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:45.780]   >>Yeah.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.780]   Okay.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.780]   A couple of thoughts on that.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:54.060]   When you say people bailing when values go down, I mean, the interesting thing is that
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:59.860]   what we're talking about with a strategy like the permanent portfolio is that if stock prices
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:05.180]   go down significantly, then -- I mean, obviously, it will depend on where your particular portfolio
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:11.660]   is, but you will most -- in almost any circumstance, you will be investing into stocks.
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:19.580]   So the great benefit of having a strategy like this is you don't have to worry and think
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.100]   about, like, oh, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be buying stocks because they've just gone
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.100]   down.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:31.420]   You just -- you rebalance into the asset classes that are low from the asset classes that are
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.420]   high.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:37.900]   And that takes out a lot of that sort of, you know, fretting over stuff that you can't
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.220]   control or do anything about.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:44.580]   So that's a nice feature which I just wanted to highlight of this approach is that whereas
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.140]   some people see a stock market crash, for example, and get totally freaked out and they
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:55.100]   start selling, the funny thing about a strategy like the permanent portfolio is you will automatically
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.380]   buy into cheap assets in the sense that you'll automatically be rebalancing in.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.060]   And that's exactly what happened to me.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:09.900]   I actually was forced to buy into stocks in -- as I said, after the crash of 2008 because
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.100]   I needed to balance -- rebalance my portfolio.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.580]   And at the time, it didn't feel great, you know.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.140]   It didn't feel great buying stocks when they were really down because, oh, what do I know?
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140]   They might go down again.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.780]   And that's all -- obviously, that's also possible, too.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.500]   As it turns out, stocks then went up.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.500]   And there you go.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.100]   So that's one thing just on that aspect.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.780]   But the other thing I wanted to say, though, is you're absolutely right that I did view
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.740]   my company totally differently to the way that I view my investments.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:44.140]   And that is the difference, I think, of -- I felt like I really -- I can influence the
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.340]   business that I run.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.980]   I can have an impact on it.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.780]   I know the ins and outs of its true value, if you like.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.420]   I mean, that's a bit of a big discussion of what that actually means.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:02.460]   But I know that it's a value-generating machine that is going to continue to be able to produce
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:07.700]   things that people want, even if today, because everyone's freaked out about the market, the
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.020]   price may be low.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:16.260]   But that was -- I'm talking about a company that I built from scratch, upwards.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:21.900]   And even then, you know, I was also subject to changes in the economy as a whole and so
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.900]   forth.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:30.860]   But if you're not building that company, if you're an outsider looking in, then you need
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:37.340]   to have a lot of insight, I think, to be able to really understand opportunities for value
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.340]   investing, so to speak.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:44.100]   And some of the problems, I think, with value investing, with the approach overall, is the
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:50.220]   idea that you can determine where the market's not valuing stocks properly and that you're
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.860]   going to have better knowledge on that than other people.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.500]   To me, that's tricky, because if you're not involved, if you're not inside and you don't
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:01.100]   really understand what's going on, then I think it's -- in some senses, I think it's
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:07.060]   more realistic if you want to be able to just get on with your life to not even try, which
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:12.180]   is the approach that I take as an index investor for stocks and as a sort of passive investor
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.220]   overall in terms of following an approach like the permanent portfolio.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.700]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.660]   And what you point out as far as the sense of ownership -- well, not just the sense of
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:26.900]   ownership, but the actual ownership and the ability to influence things.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.020]   One of the things that I've struggled with and I've observed -- and I don't think I ever
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:35.340]   really figured this out when I was working as an investment advisor -- is I think people
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:39.500]   sometimes are looking for stocks to do things that they can't -- that they're not able to
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.060]   do.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:47.700]   And two examples pop to mind, one exactly what you just said, and then another one as
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.860]   far as what they can actually do in your portfolio.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.300]   Let me go with the number two first.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.820]   You didn't make your money with the permanent portfolio.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:03.720]   The fact that your ability to sit back and relax and enjoy life and travel to Mexico
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.940]   and work on your books and work on your projects because you're financially independent, that
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.000]   didn't come from the permanent portfolio.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.340]   Your lifestyle may now be afforded by the portfolio -- your strategy may now be the
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:20.340]   permanent portfolio, but that came because you built a business and because, you know,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:26.060]   I assume that you were able to get far higher rates of return than 10 percent.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:31.540]   Because 10 percent rates of return, unless you have a very long period of time, just
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:37.420]   doesn't get you financially independent unless you have either a very high savings rate or
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.720]   a long period of time.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.800]   It doesn't get you financially independent in a short term.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.500]   But building a company that does have value, that you can basically create money -- I mean,
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.020]   that's how I think of building companies is you create money, you create assets out of
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.500]   nothing through the application of human skill and ideas and effort and energy.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.780]   You turn human capital into something that can ultimately be sold and turned into financial
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.660]   capital and that's so tangible when you build a business.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:09.440]   So that's the point is that you built the business and then you had the lump sum of
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:13.500]   money that you say, "I now need to invest so that I can sustain my lifestyle and protect
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.560]   this asset."
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.960]   The second thing is that sense of ownership.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.740]   A lot of people are looking for that and it may not be in stocks.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:27.160]   And my encouragement to many people is that you may want -- if you don't understand, if
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.360]   you don't like investing in stocks, if you don't like investing in publicly traded companies
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:39.160]   that you cannot influence, you're not going to be an activist shareholder unless you are.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.760]   But if you don't like that, it's okay to say, "I'm not going to purchase this asset class.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.240]   I'm going to walk away."
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.240]   And what's happened over the last 30, 40, 50 years is we've gotten to the point where
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:57.440]   now a majority of the population is invested in stocks and a majority of the population
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.000]   is exercising control over their portfolios.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   And we've done that without providing any -- and there's no education.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.920]   There's no formal schooling or education on investment markets or how they work, capital
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.540]   markets, how they function.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:17.640]   And so we've got a world of amateur investors, none of whom are comfortable with the subject,
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.480]   but yet in the 401(k) system we have in the States -- and I don't know what your system
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.660]   is there in the UK -- but now instead of professional investors, everyone is forced to do it.
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:31.200]   And so we've got to make up some ground with the education, with new investment strategies
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:39.320]   to help people and give them the tools that they need to be able to manage their portfolios.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.640]   And it's okay to say, "I don't want to own stocks."
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.340]   If you're uncomfortable with it, it's probably better to go away and build a small local
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:51.340]   business that you can have that sense of ownership and sense of control where you're not worried
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.380]   about what the banker thinks it's worth.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.760]   You know what it's worth because it prints your paycheck and it prints your dividends
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:02.440]   and you can feel confident of the fact that that business has a market, that business
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.480]   can be passed on, that business can fund your retirement.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.120]   So those are just two points that I don't think we talk about enough when we talk about
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   investments.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.920]   >>Yeah, and I just want to say I really agree with you.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.000]   One of the things, in fact, that Harry Brown emphasized in his book is not to consider
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.840]   investing as the source of your wealth.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.160]   And he basically emphasizes the point that what you do in terms of your work, that's
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.840]   how you're going to make your money for the vast majority of people.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.080]   And yeah, there are a couple of exceptions, but the vast majority of people, it's what
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.640]   you do in terms of your skills are what are going to make you money.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.400]   And in my case, that was entrepreneurship, building a business, and so forth.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.540]   And that's exactly how I view the permanent portfolio as the place to park that, keep
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.640]   it safe, and so forth, not as a get-rich-quick scheme.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.160]   It's really not.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.560]   And it's the last of the -- you should never consider it now, because it's actually designed
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.520]   not to have volatility.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:08.840]   So I absolutely agree with you that the key, I think, is to focus on what your individual
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.280]   skill sets are, what you can do that is rare and valuable, what you're able to do to generate
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.760]   value in the world.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.880]   And for me, it was entrepreneurship, and that's how I made my money.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.240]   And the investment, and that's one of the reasons why I'm such a conservative investor
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:30.760]   is because I created it elsewhere, and now I just don't want to blow it, basically.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.600]   And that's the reason I take that approach.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:39.160]   And as you say, there are real limits to any paper asset appreciation and value.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:45.880]   And you really have to do something where you can create significant value and significant
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:52.280]   change in the world, like building a business, in order to kind of get to a point where you
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.800]   have financial independence.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.120]   And it would be -- I think it would be wrong to expect the permanent portfolio to create
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120]   that for you.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.200]   That's not what it's for.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:05.520]   It's to protect you against all of the economic circumstances that can happen, and to give
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.560]   you a return that's above the rate of inflation.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:14.080]   And you mentioned that 8 to 10 percent that I was talking about historically, that's not
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.840]   even -- I mean, that's actually before inflation.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.000]   That's not taking into account inflation.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.760]   There's less than that in terms of a real return.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.280]   It's like 3 or 4 percent or something.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.160]   For the American one, again, you'd have to check the actual numbers.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.760]   But that's the general approach.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   So I hope that that gives people a perspective on my personal take on why this has been a
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.240]   useful approach for me to adopt.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.280]   And there is also one more thing I'd like to say about the approach, which is that,
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:45.640]   you know, although the permanent portfolio is a really -- one of those set it and forget
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.920]   it type investment strategies, where you can get on with your life and do other things,
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.760]   Harry Brown also gave some great advice about speculating.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   And he basically said, look, if you want to -- if you think that something interesting
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.400]   is happening in the markets and you want to speculate, and you think you might know about
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.600]   something or understand something that could give you an insight into how things are going
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.440]   to develop, then if you want to do it, just do it.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.120]   Create a speculative portfolio.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.640]   He calls it the variable portfolio.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.720]   And just be clear with yourself about exactly how much of your money you're going to devote
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.840]   to that, and be clear with yourself and conscious about why you're doing it, what your sort
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:32.680]   of boundaries are in terms of not kind of refunding it from your permanent portfolio,
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.440]   not subsidizing any losses from the -- in your speculations from the PP.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:43.400]   But his approach was very flexible in that, you know, he recognized that people do like
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:49.760]   to invest in specific things that they may know about as a speculation.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.640]   But he just had a very clear idea that you should be honest with yourself about saying,
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.200]   this is me having a go.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.400]   I reckon this might be a good thing to invest in.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Who knows?
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   I'm going to go for it.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.480]   I reckon I've got an insight into where the market's going.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:12.320]   So I'm going to invest in Bitcoin or I'm going to invest in precious metals or I'm going
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.720]   to invest in property or whatever it is, whatever particular thing that you think you have some
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   insight in.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:25.960]   And the idea in doing that is you don't keep morphing your overall strategy when the next
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.040]   big thing comes along.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.600]   You have kind of like a walled playground for your speculation, which is called your
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.200]   variable portfolio.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.800]   And you dedicate only a specific amount of money that you're willing to lose, that you're
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:42.000]   happy that you could just -- that could go to zero.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.800]   And for the money that you're not happy to lose, for the stuff that you want to protect,
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:53.520]   you use a strategy with the built-in protections like the permanent portfolio side.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.560]   So that's another bit of built-in flexibility.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:03.600]   And even then, there's no guarantee, even with all of those built-in protections, there
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:10.560]   could be circumstances where the permanent portfolio could do really badly.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.880]   That's another aspect about not being able to predict the future.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.200]   But in terms of what we do know and what we can predict, I think it's a great approach
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:23.200]   for giving you that less volatility and lots of safety features.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.000]   I think it is, and I want to comment on a couple of things you just said, and then we'll
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.840]   kind of wrap up.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:34.120]   The two things you said, number one, about speculating, I'm glad that he put that in
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.720]   there, because it is always interesting to me that in general, my observation is many
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:46.200]   people who write books usually made their money based upon some aspect of speculation
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:54.160]   or based upon some aspect of providing or building a company, not necessarily on building
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.800]   wealth -- excuse me, not necessarily on what they have said.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:04.360]   So Harry Brown, he speculated on the decoupling of the dollar from the gold standard.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:09.800]   He made a pile of money, and then he had that problem of how do I protect this money?
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:17.560]   And I think that -- so then it's easier once you have a pile of money to then say -- look
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.360]   at it and say, you know, here's the money that I'm not willing to -- here's the money
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.920]   that I'm not willing to lose.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:29.160]   I think especially for entrepreneurs, this is an important point.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:34.040]   Your experience with being a conservative investor is similar to my experience in working
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.040]   with clients.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.400]   I have found that entrepreneurs are among the more conservative of investors.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:45.320]   Generally it seems like employees are more aggressive than entrepreneurs are, and I don't
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:51.560]   know why, although I have some hypotheses that it may be due to the need to take -- the
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:57.840]   responsibility that an entrepreneur -- where it weighs on their shoulder, the observation
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.320]   of the risks that exist, whereas maybe an employee is not exposed to those risks every
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.280]   day, it's more of like I come here, I do this job, and I'm done.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:12.440]   But I found most entrepreneurs to be very -- to be very risk averse.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.760]   >>Can I give you my take on that?
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.760]   >>Sure.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   Go ahead.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:21.240]   >>So, I mean, for me, there was so much risk in entrepreneurship.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:30.880]   You know, there's so much kind of roller coaster risk involved in starting a business and growing
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.720]   it, and I think for entrepreneurs -- I mean, this is my experience.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.680]   That was such a huge risk, and I borrowed a lot of money to do it, and it could have
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:46.000]   all failed, and it was a big set of unknowns, and I had to deal with all those unknowns
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   the whole time.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.200]   But I think for me, that was where all my risk taking went, was into entrepreneurship.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.800]   That was my big -- my budget for risk taking got used up in the venture.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.680]   And so once I actually made money with the venture, it was like, look, I don't want to
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680]   take any more risks.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.680]   That's it.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680]   That's great.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   It worked.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:12.160]   Now I just want to be safe, and I don't expect this to be like winning the lottery in terms
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.280]   of investments, but I think that's partly is that entrepreneurs are already taking very
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.440]   significant risks, whereas I think maybe if you're in an employee situation, it's more
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.200]   like, well, I'm not really taking any big risks, so, you know, let's see whether or
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:32.360]   not I can take a punt and maybe make some big returns on more risky investments.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.740]   Maybe that's one of the sort of reasons for that mindset.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.840]   But I do find it interesting, your experience of dealing with the two client types.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.040]   That's really interesting to hear.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040]   >>Right.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.700]   And entrepreneurs also get very frustrated at the lack of control and are quicker to
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.480]   bail and say, that's it.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.680]   I can't control what these stock prices are going to do, so I'm going to go and take my
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.040]   money and invest it with my buddy and his business where at least I can have a little
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.080]   bit more of an inside line.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.840]   And many people have made money on that.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:10.720]   The other aspect of what you were saying just about the portfolio is I think that's where
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.640]   I always come back to is the financial planning perspective.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.320]   And a lot of people may not understand what I mean by that, but what I mean is that investment
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.800]   management is only one part of it.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.360]   And here you have an investment philosophy and an investment approach that can work very
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.360]   well.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.560]   But then at the end of the day, rationally, we have to go back to financial planning.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.960]   And so you say, well, how do I figure out what is the money that I can afford to lose?
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.760]   Well, if you're an entrepreneur and you've worked hard to build a company and you sit
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.280]   down and you say, here's the lifestyle at which I would like to live, here's the income
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:49.280]   that I need to make sure, do I have enough money that I could carve off some of it and
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.520]   make sure that I would never, at least never, have to go back to work again if I didn't
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.040]   want to?
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040]   That's the number.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.680]   And so you've got to focus on those financial planning calculations and allow those to influence
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.320]   your other decisions.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.600]   For a young person just getting started, I think it is reasonable to take more risk,
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.960]   not because theoretically you have time for stocks to recover, but because if you haven't
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.600]   spent a lifetime building something, if you haven't invested 10 years into building a
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.880]   company, then it's okay to go ahead and take a risk.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.960]   But once you've invested 10 years into something and you've sold that company out, you may
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.240]   do it again, but you may want to go ahead and make sure that you never have to do it
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.360]   again if you don't want to.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:38.080]   And so, and then the last thing on the speculation, it'll be interesting to see what happens as
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.560]   time goes on.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:45.720]   I was reading over the weekend, I read a piece by William Bernstein, who is a respected academic
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.260]   on the subject of investing, has written a lot on index funds and developed the theory
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.540]   of index funds from the academic perspective.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:58.680]   And he wrote an essay on Harry Brown's permanent portfolio, and he was acknowledging and he
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:07.960]   was tracking the flows in and out of the permanent portfolio mutual fund that is available as
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.440]   a proxy for investor behavior.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.160]   And he was talking about the problem and the benefit of the permanent portfolio, and this
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.160]   has been my experience with every investment philosophy, it all comes down to the behavior
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:24.720]   of the investor, is that people will run to, he was in his essay, and I'm not sure if you've
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.200]   read it, Jake, but he said people will run to the permanent portfolio in times that are
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:37.600]   bad, and then they will be attracted to the next fancy object when the times are better.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.400]   And as such, they will never reap the benefits of the permanent portfolio, and it's quite
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.400]   sad.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.880]   Right, that's interesting.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:50.640]   And I would also say that I personally, obviously this is a personal decision, I wouldn't be
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.840]   interested in the permanent portfolio fund for a couple of reasons.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.240]   One is that it's not exactly the permanent portfolio.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.400]   I mean, the structure of the fund is from a slightly earlier variation.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.720]   I believe that it holds some silver and various other things.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.680]   I don't know the exact, I'm not certain of the exact composition, because we don't have
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:10.360]   it here anyway, it's only in the States, as far as I know.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:15.720]   But I wouldn't, so it's not quite the same strategy as the one that I really know and
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.720]   understand.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.800]   There are some things in there that don't make 100% sense to me.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.560]   But also, I guess this is maybe a personal thing too, I think part of the benefit of
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.480]   the permanent portfolio is the control that you get from managing it yourself.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:33.480]   And the very, some of the things like holding gold abroad and stuff, I'm not quite sure
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.040]   how that would work if it was in a fund.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.560]   You wouldn't get the same protections that you do if you manage it yourself.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.880]   So that's just my personal take on that.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.240]   Right, and I agree with you 100%.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.360]   That's where the permanent portfolio, from the perspective of a little bit of gold here
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:55.440]   and there, a little bit of cash here and there, all those other advantages, and the low cost,
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:01.320]   the ability to strip out all your cost, to me, that's very attractive.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:06.680]   But when you turn it into a mutual fund and you say, "Okay, I'm going to pay, I think
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.880]   it's 70 or 80 basis points of fees so that they can hold cash and gold, and it's still
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.840]   locked up in a mutual fund, so it's still a paper asset.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:20.160]   So yes, the gold market may go up or down, but it's still a paper asset now."
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:25.080]   It just doesn't make as much sense to me as doing it yourself.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.080]   So I agree with you.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.640]   Jake, if someone were interested in knowing more about the permanent portfolio, where
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:35.200]   would you send them to do their research and educate themselves?
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.240]   So the first thing that I would really recommend is to read Failsafe Investing by Harry Brown.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.840]   It's a super easy read.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:46.600]   It's a short book, and it's a great introduction to the permanent portfolio.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:52.400]   If you're interested in a more in-depth treatment and a more up-to-date treatment, then the
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:32:04.680]   book called The Permanent Portfolio by Craig Rowland and J.L. Lawson is a very good sort
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:11.560]   of detailed treatment of how do you buy gold and where should you hold it and how do you
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.680]   buy bonds and so forth.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.560]   It's really, really good, but it's much more technical and much more in-depth.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.320]   I would say that the Harry Brown book is a good starter.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:28.520]   There's also Craig's website, thecrawlingroad.com, I think, has got articles about the permanent
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:33.840]   portfolio, and you can find links there to the Permanent Portfolio Discussion Board,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.240]   where various people who are taking this approach, individual investors, talk to each other about
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:43.200]   things that they find and problems that they've dealt with, and they are a very nice bunch
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.320]   and they help each other, so that's another resource.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.680]   I also have a number of discussions about the Permanent Portfolio on The Voluntary Life,
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:58.840]   so if you look under the tag "investing," then you can find that.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.160]   I can give you that for the show notes, too, Joshua.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.520]   Yeah, that would be great.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.000]   I will echo Harry Brown's book, Fail Safe Investing is Excellent, and it's simple.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.280]   One thing he did in that book, he actually divided the book into two sections and wrote
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:20.080]   part one and gave his, what was it, 11 or 12 or 13 rules of investing, something like
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:26.920]   that, and then he said everything he had to say, and then he gave a part two and said
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.320]   more on each of them, so if you want the deeper version, you can read the whole book, but
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.960]   if you're not much of a reader, you can just read the first half.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:39.800]   I really liked a lot of what he had to say in there, and it's good, good rules to keep
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   in mind.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.760]   And then a warning on the Permanent Portfolio book, it's excellent.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.200]   It's not light.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.440]   The authors have put a lot of time into it, and so don't, unless you've spent some time
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.920]   just thinking about this, don't expect us to wade through it.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.000]   It's very much a how-to, and this is a compliment, it's not a criticism of the book, but it's
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.800]   very much a how-to, and it's a how-to implement the portfolio across platforms, so if you're
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:09.100]   looking for just a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund solution, if you're trying to figure
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:14.640]   out how to buy gold with a Swiss banker or with the Australian Mint or the Perth Mint,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.320]   things like that, it's not a light read, but it is well done.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.800]   And I haven't spent much time in there for him, but I'll have to go over there and read
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.800]   some of the articles.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800]   I would enjoy that.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.320]   So, Jake, thanks so much for being with us.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.560]   I've really enjoyed this conversation, and I hope that it's a helpful resource for our
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.560]   listeners.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.880]   It was great chatting to you again.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   And that's our show.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.880]   Hope you enjoyed that.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.080]   Jake, thank you for coming on.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   I enjoyed having you.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:48.760]   I feel like we have lots of stuff to talk about, and an hour was plenty for today, but
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.280]   we certainly could have gone on and chatted about lots of other stuff.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.280]   I think you did also an excellent job representing the permanent portfolio and some of the ideas
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.280]   and the concepts in it, and I want to thank you for doing that.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.440]   And I want to thank you for everything you're doing over at Voluntary Life as well, promoting
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:08.000]   the causes of personal liberty and freedom and voluntarism and all of those types of
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000]   things.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000]   So thank you for coming on.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   I appreciate it.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.480]   And I hope you enjoyed today's show.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.000]   This is just the first of many of these types of shows that I'd like to bring you.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.680]   I feel like we don't do a good enough job of bringing in-depth, investing content to
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.560]   the public, so I'd like to bring many, many more kinds of these shows to you of interviews
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:31.280]   with various people, as well as bring you in-depth, more and more of this in-depth teaching
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.880]   content to build on so that you have a firm grasp of knowledge to understand a lot of
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.640]   concepts that maybe you've just heard the words and haven't been able to understand
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.760]   before.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   Thank you for listening today.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760]   Give me some feedback.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   Let me know what you thought of the show.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:49.360]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com via email or on Twitter @radicalpf.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.240]   If you haven't left a review, I'd be thrilled if you leave an iTunes review.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:56.680]   And even what's even better today, I've got an email newsletter set up.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.560]   I know we're bringing you a lot of shows.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.240]   Every single day there's new content.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.800]   You'd be surprised if you were able to listen to all of the shows.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:10.640]   So the best way to keep pace on the shows and figure out the content that you are interested
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.720]   in is come by the blog at radicalpersonalfinance.com and enter your email address and sign up for
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.160]   the email newsletter.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.520]   And every day I will send you the complete show notes for the show, not just even a blurb
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.320]   where you got to click over the site, but the complete show notes so you can tell right
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:27.600]   in your email if it's a topic that you're interested in listening to and you can just
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.940]   pop over and listen to the episode from there.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.320]   So that would be my recommendation for you so that you can keep pace.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.400]   We're here every single day, Monday through Friday, with in-depth financial content like
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.400]   this.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   So hope you enjoyed it.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.400]   Have a lovely Tuesday, everybody.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:39.400]   Peace out.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:40.240]   Peace out.

[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:31.660]   [music]
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:32.660]   Cheers, y'all.
