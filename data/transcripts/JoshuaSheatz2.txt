[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:27.200]   Hi, it's Miles and I'm really old and I love race cars and family adventure podcasts. Goodbye.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.300]   This is Family Adventure Podcast, inspiring families to dream, travel, and accomplish epic adventures.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.000]   And now your host, Eric Hemingway.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.100]   Hello folks, welcome back to Family Adventure Podcast.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.800]   And if this is the first time you've come here, then how's it going?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   Welcome to the group.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   We're glad you're here.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is the place where we like to talk about family adventure travel, kind of specializing in nomadic travel.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.300]   Travel families that just take off and go for a year or more and live nomadically all over the globe or all of the United States.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.700]   RVs, boats, bikes, whatever, trains.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.000]   We don't have a train family yet, but we're looking for one.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.600]   So if you know somebody who's taking a long train ride or trains across countries, we'd love to hear about it.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.400]   So anyways, this week we are finishing our interview with Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600]   Got into a little bit kind of general ideas last week.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.400]   And this week he really dives into a lot of specifics on your budget, how to get a hold of your budget, find out ways you can save money.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.700]   It boils down to three things.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.600]   I loved how he said it.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.900]   How much you make, how much you spend, and what you do with the difference.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.200]   And financial planning 101 is spend less than you make.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   So there's really only three ways you can tweak it.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.600]   Either you make more money, spend less, or invest better.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.700]   So we talk a lot about that this week.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.900]   That's pretty cool stuff.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.600]   And yeah, so we're excited.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.700]   So we'll dive right in.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.400]   And thanks everybody for listening and for leaving reviews on iTunes.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   Appreciate that.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.100]   And for joining our email list, we've got some exciting stuff coming up.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:21.100]   We're going to actually start launching a coaching program where we are going to come alongside families and help walk them through the process from start to finish on how to build a plan to get you out of the treadmill onto a traveling life.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.300]   And we're super stoked to announce that in a few weeks.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.300]   But we just wanted to kind of let you know that's coming up.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.400]   And we will dive into the interview.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200]   Enough of me rambling on, all right?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600]   I'm shutting up now.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.700]   Okay, let's head into the interview.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.800]   Could I add, I prepared a few thoughts that I'd like to share that would be specific to travel.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.000]   And feel free to cut this out or to add it in another show and split it out or something like that.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.900]   But I think it would be helpful to some ideas that would be helpful around family adventure.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.300]   Great.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.100]   Could I share?
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.300]   Okay.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.700]   Yeah, sure.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.500]   Could because I want to, I don't want to, I want to leave people with some tactics and some exposure to some big picture ideas without getting into like specifics.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   But I want to apply the science of financial planning to the science of goal achievement.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.200]   So first on debt, I wanted to give some tactics that I think would be helpful.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.900]   As far as tactics, here would be some specific suggestions.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.300]   Number one, start by tracking your money.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.600]   The number one thing that most people do not do is they do not track their money.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   If you do not track your money, then you don't know where it's going.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.300]   And if you don't know where it's going, you can't go back and say, is it going where I want it to go?
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.200]   I don't care how you track your money.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.600]   I recommend to people that they start with a way that's very tangible.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.000]   So sometimes just by being, you know, tangible with it, maybe that means a three of a five card in your pocket and a pen.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.400]   Maybe that means a note on your smartphone.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.300]   Maybe that means a checkbook register.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.200]   Maybe that means, you know, just something where you're actually physically writing it down a notebook every night.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.900]   You take your receipts out and you write it down.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.000]   Make up a way that works for you.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.100]   I try not to say do it this way because some ways work for some people.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.900]   Some people like their smartphone and enter that in.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.000]   I personally don't.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.100]   I would rather carry a three of a five card and a pen and write it down.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.600]   But track your money in some manner.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.300]   There are a lot of great electronic solutions for this.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.800]   So there are a lot of apps that you can use.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.000]   There are integrated comprehensive apps.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.900]   Mint is the most famous of them.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.700]   There's an app called Personal Capital.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.000]   These are probably two of the prettiest, most popular popularized.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   There are a number of other apps that are more specific, a little bit simpler.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   Maybe you can find an app that you like.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.500]   But I think there's a lot of value in you have to track your money.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.900]   You have to track your money so that you can create what we call a cash flow statement.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.200]   And the key of this, I've got an entire show on it.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   Eric, you can go and find it in the show notes if you want to link to it.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.900]   But I've got an entire show on how to create a cash flow statement.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.800]   But here's the key.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   Most people, when they're creating a cash flow statement,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.600]   they're purely writing down their expenses.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   I recommend, that's a good place to start.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.800]   If you've never done that, that's good.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.900]   But you want to go and you want to track all of your income from every source before taxes.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.000]   And then you want to write down all of your expenses to every source.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.900]   And you want to go and do it before taxes.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.200]   Instead, what many people do is they just take the net that they get maybe on their paycheck
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.300]   and they write that down and they budget off of that.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.600]   The problem is though, that there's 7.65% if you're an employee coming out already
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.400]   for social security, for employment taxes.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.100]   That would be social security taxes and Medicare taxes.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.200]   Number two is that there's some amount of income tax being withheld and deducted from your check.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   And so I've helped people find tens of thousands of dollars
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.700]   that they're spending that we can just save on taxes.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.300]   I did a show recently with a guy, Justin, from a website called Root of Good,
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.700]   who retired at 33 and we went through on the interview an example
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.900]   of where he was able to pay, he had $150,000 income
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.300]   and he paid his three kids and he paid $150 total of income taxes.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.300]   And we worked out that it's possible that somebody could make $150,000
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.400]   and spend $30,000 on taxes.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   If you're looking for a travel budget, I just found a $30,000 travel budget with good tax planning.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.700]   So create a cash flow statement and write down all of the pre-tax income
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.600]   and then write down what your taxes are, work that out.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.000]   I've got a whole show on that.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.800]   Number two, create an actual balance sheet.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.600]   This is another thing that many people don't do.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   Write down everything that you own, exactly what it's worth,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.200]   everything that you owe, exactly what it's worth.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   Then you can look at those things and you can start to say,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.600]   "Am I happy with this? Am I making progress?"
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.800]   So those are the two fundamental financial statements that you need to create for yourself.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   That's the first thing that as a financial planner,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   when you come in and you're working with someone,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   the first thing that you do is you create those statements.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   I don't make a big deal about budgeting in the sense of a forward-looking,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.200]   "Here's what I'm going to spend on this month or not."
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.400]   For some people, that's really, really helpful.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   For other people, it's really, really discouraging.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.600]   So I would encourage people, if they feel like they're not in control with their money,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.400]   I would encourage them to really figure out a system of budgeting that works for them.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.600]   What's simplest is a legal pad and a pen. Make it simple.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.200]   For some people, they like to use a software solution.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   There may be something built in with the bank,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   but budgeting is forward-looking, tracking is backward-looking.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.800]   Budgeting is what affects how much money you have at the end of the month.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.400]   Backward-looking just simply tells you what you did.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.000]   If you are in trouble, you've got to budget.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   If you are generally pretty comfortable, it's probably not so necessary.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.000]   So I'm a little flexible on that.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   I would encourage people to get very tactical with their finance.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.000]   What happens is that it's so easy in today's world to lose touch with your money.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.800]   You've got your credit card registered at Amazon,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   so you just click "Buy with one click" and there's a new $10 e-book.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.000]   You've got your credit card running all of your bills.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   You've got all of these certain... You've got all these different things.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.800]   What I've found when I've been in financial trouble,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.800]   and this is one thing that has helped me,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   and I've noticed it to help many people as I've worked with them,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   is that I believe both automating your finances
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   and un-automating your finances is very valuable.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.400]   If you're a little out of control, you need to pay attention.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   A good way to do that is stop the automatic payments everywhere,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.000]   stop the automatic contributions everywhere,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   take a checking account and a checkbook register.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   The checkbook register is still the most valuable cash flow planning tool
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.200]   I've ever been able to figure out.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.600]   Our grandparents got rich with a checkbook register.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Almost nobody keeps one today.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.400]   And I find it incredibly valuable for me to keep a checkbook register.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.600]   Write your bills manually, record the checkbook register,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.800]   keep it up to date.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.400]   That allows you to be in touch with what's going on.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.200]   If you're happy with where you're at,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   you're happy with what you're saving, with where you're going,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   how it's working, then you can take that and you can translate that
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.400]   and say, "Now I'm going to go ahead and automate things."
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   So automating is also powerful,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.000]   but it's only powerful if you're doing the right thing.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.400]   So you can automate your savings, automate your investments.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   Make sure that you're actually paying yourself first.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.200]   Most of the people all have heard of the idea of paying yourself first,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.400]   but the idea doesn't get it done.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   Just actually saying, "I know about that,"
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.800]   doesn't mean that the very first thing you do is save some money
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.200]   toward whatever the financial goal is that you have.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.000]   You have to actually do it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.400]   So figure out a way to make sure that you actually do it.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.400]   One of the ways, if you're going through,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.600]   there are only three things that you can possibly adjust
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.400]   from a strategy of wealth building.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.600]   To build wealth, and I define wealth whether in a small sense
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   toward a specific goal, that may be a family adventure goal,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.200]   or in the larger sense, that may be toward something like financial independence.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   There are only three things that you have control over.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.000]   The number one thing is how much income do you have?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.800]   The number two is how much are your expenses?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.600]   And number three is what do you do with the difference between those two?
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.000]   So people who are broke, they don't make very much money,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.200]   they have high expenses, sometimes those expenses exceed their income,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.400]   so they're paying a lot of interest on the difference between those things.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   People who get wealthy have a much higher income than they do have expenses,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   and so they have a higher income, they have lower expenses,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.400]   and they invest the difference between those things wisely.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   That's it. That's the formula.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.200]   That's frustrating and it's encouraging.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   It's encouraging because it's simple, it's frustrating
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   because you don't know exactly what to do with it.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   So the key is to attack it in different periods of time.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.400]   So number one, income.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.200]   Is there something that I can or should do to increase my income?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.400]   This can be as simple as changing jobs.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.600]   Most people do not handle their career in an efficient manner.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.200]   They're happy with getting a 3%, 4%, 5% raise,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.000]   when you could find a competitor, if you enhanced your attractiveness
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.800]   to an employer, you may find a competitor who will give you a 55% raise.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.600]   And it's far easier to swap out employers every few years
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.800]   and climb the ladders of income, very straightforward,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   instead of staying at one place where they're just going to give you
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   continual cost of living raises.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.000]   But in order to do that, you have to become more attractive.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So you have to focus on building your skills,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.600]   you have to focus on becoming more employable,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.200]   you have to focus on building up.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.400]   That may mean a formal certification, maybe you need an MBA,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   maybe you don't because a formal certification is not valuable,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.200]   but you need to become much more excellent with leadership.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   You need to go to some industry conferences,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.600]   you need to network within your industry,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.800]   you may need to start a blog where you're doing book reviews on your industry.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.400]   So something if you're an employee to increase your income substantially.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.800]   If you're an entrepreneur, you have a tremendous opportunity
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.400]   to focus on ways to constantly be increasing your income.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   Number two is expenses.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think there are a couple of ways that are useful to track expense, to do expenses.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.600]   Because you started with tracking expenses,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   then I would recommend that you order these expenses
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   from highest to lowest and from lowest to highest.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   Many people when they first start to think about saving money,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.800]   they automatically start with the little things.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   So there's a joke in the personal finance world about the latte factors.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   The idea is if you just cut out the expensive coffee, you'll get rich.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   That may be and that works great.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   But the reality is that some people really love and value that daily latte.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   So it may be that it's more effective to flip it around and say,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   what are my biggest expenses?
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.400]   So you see this a lot of times when people get a travel bug.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.600]   List your expenses in order of highest expenses to lowest expenses.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.000]   For most people, the number one highest expense will be housing.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.600]   So start with housing and say,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.200]   what could I do to cut my housing cost by 50% or more
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   without sacrificing my lifestyle?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   It may or may not be possible,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.600]   but by asking a really big question like that,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   you may come up with an alternative idea that will fit your goal.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.000]   So Eric, you and Rachel were sailors.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.200]   There are tons of people who all throughout a period of time have done this.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.400]   They move from a house onto a sailboat.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.600]   They don't have the money to go sailing yet,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.800]   but they buy the sailboat and they move in there
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   and they cut their expenses by a massive amount while they're still saving.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.600]   That makes the goal be able to achieve much more quickly.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   So what can I do to cut this by 50% or more?
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.000]   And then brainstorm that.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   Write that question at the top of a sheet of paper.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.400]   Write down 30 ideas to activate the creative juices.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.600]   The first 8 may be easy and the last 22 are incredibly difficult.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.800]   But be creative, be wacky, be crazy.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   I could move into my car, I could move in with my parents,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.200]   I could rent out 3 of my rooms on Airbnb,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.400]   I could have a roommate, we could move to Japan.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.600]   I don't know what the answer is, but be wacky, be crazy.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   And then just simply look at those ideas and see,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.000]   do I actually want to do any of these?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.200]   If you don't want to do any of them, skip it.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.400]   Do the exercise in a different way and do something.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.600]   But you can come up with solutions that work for your scenario
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.800]   if you ask that kind of question.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.000]   Look at transportation expenses.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.200]   There's a common thread in the early retirement community
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.400]   that what you do is you buy a house that's either close to your job
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.600]   or you rent an apartment that's close to your job.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.800]   Or it can be on a place that you have public transportation to your job.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   So maybe you ride on a bus line or a subway stop that goes directly to your job.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.200]   So you can sell a couple of cars or sell one of the cars.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.400]   Cars are expensive to own and operate, so maybe there's your travel fund.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.600]   That's usually for most people, it's housing, taxes, vehicle expenses
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.800]   are often the biggest categories, followed by food.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.000]   So you can say, what can I do to cut my food costs by 50% or more?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.200]   And you may be able to find an answer.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.400]   So you would eat rice and beans, you would learn to coupon,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.600]   you would grow your own food.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   I don't know the answer, but it's a mental shift.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.000]   Then flip it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.200]   And at some point in time, this is not all exercises for one night,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.400]   this is an ongoing period of an action plan.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.600]   Flip it on its head and start with little expenses and say,
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.800]   what can I do with this little expense?
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.000]   I'm spending $60 a month on my cell phone bill.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.200]   My wife and I have iPhone plans that cost $10 a month with Air Voice Wireless.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.400]   So if I can save $50 a month on my cell phone bill,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   that's a major savings.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.800]   So flip it and look through all those little expenses.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.000]   And I like to tell people, optimize one thing every month.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.200]   So pick one category and spend a month on that category.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.400]   Brainstorming, what are my ideas, what could I implement?
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.600]   Maybe you need to research cell phone carriers,
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.800]   maybe you need to shop your auto insurance.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   Some people can save $1,000 a year just by shopping their car insurance,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.200]   but most of the time we don't do it.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   So if we can do it, and then sitting down and working on it,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.600]   and consistently working on it, we can reduce those expenses.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.800]   And the key is, it's often easier to reduce expenses
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.000]   than it is to increase income or increase investment returns.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.200]   Quick rule of thumb, and I know I'm just like spurting everything out,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.400]   but I want to make this show incredibly valuable,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.600]   because I want to see tons of people having family adventures.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800]   But a quick rule of thumb from the early retirement community
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.000]   that I think is so valuable is to operate
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   in terms of a mental model of financial independence.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.400]   So there's a rule of thumb that we use in financial planning,
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.600]   that if you're going to live off of a portfolio of investment assets,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.800]   stocks, bonds, mutual funds,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.000]   then you can safely spend about 4% of a portfolio per year into perpetuity.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.200]   Now there's some more nuance to it,
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.400]   but it's a useful mental model.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.600]   So what you can do is you can take every single monthly expense
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.800]   and you can multiply that monthly expense by 3%
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and that will tell you how much of a portfolio you need to have
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.200]   in order to fund yourself on an ongoing basis without needing to work.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.400]   So let's say somebody wants to go and travel
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.600]   and their monthly travel budget is $2,000.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.800]   Well a good place to start with a financial goal
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.000]   is take $2,000 and multiply that times 300.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.200]   That comes out to be $600,000.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.400]   Now this is not the only way to go and travel,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.600]   but if you wanted to travel full time,
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   you wanted to "retire",
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.000]   then you need a $600,000 portfolio
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.200]   under that rule of thumb doing this with mutual funds and paper assets.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.400]   So a question would be if I'm looking at a cell phone bill
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.600]   and let's say that I'm looking at there
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.800]   and there's a mom and a dad and a couple of kids on a cell phone plan
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.000]   and that cell phone plan is $150 a month.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.200]   In order to pay for that cell phone bill on an ongoing basis,
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.400]   I multiply that $150 times 300.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   And I can look at that and say this person needs to save $45,000
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.800]   to be able to fund this cell phone bill into perpetuity.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.000]   Now if I could cut that from $150 a month to $50 a month,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.200]   then $50 a month times 300
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.400]   winds up being $15,000.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.600]   So that's a difference of a total need
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.800]   to accumulate an extra $30,000.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.000]   The question is this, you look at your savings rate
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.200]   and you say, "Okay, I'm saving this amount of money on a monthly basis.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   How long will it take me to accumulate $30,000?"
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.600]   For many people that's 3, 4, 5, 6 years to be able to accumulate that.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.800]   And a lot of times it's easier to go from $150 a month
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.000]   cell phone expense to a $50 a month cell phone expense
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.200]   than it is to go from, you know, to save,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.400]   than it is to save the extra,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.600]   go from $15,000 saved to $45,000 saved.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.800]   So that's a very useful rule of thumb
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.000]   that I use in my mind to evaluate ongoing expenses
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   and say, "Is this worth it to me?"
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.400]   It values a lot.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.600]   If you recognize that I could save $200 a month on my groceries
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.800]   by working out a couponing strategy
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.000]   or by growing some of my own food
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.200]   or by learning to cook for myself,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.400]   that's $60,000 that I don't need to save
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.600]   toward that ongoing travel expense.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.800]   I'll pause because I just gave you a pop.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   No, that is fantastic.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.200]   That is a great way to think about it.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.400]   When you think about taking that number and multiplying it times 300
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.600]   and really this is what you're going to look at over the long haul,
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.800]   that is a huge shift
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.000]   and that is radical personal finance.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.200]   That's really grabbing the checkbook by the horns
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   and putting it into practical terms, which is fantastic.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.600]   So many...
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   The average person, what maybe 2 out of 100 think like that
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.000]   or actually dive into their own finances
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.200]   and really evaluate where they are and where they're going.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.400]   Very few do.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.600]   Very few.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   What would it look like if more did?
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.000]   It's awesome.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.200]   I've got a couple more ideas I want to share.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.400]   I want to flip it, especially with the focus on travel,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   which went over is basically some money management.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.800]   So that's focusing a lot on the income and the expense side.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.000]   When it comes down to how can I invest the difference wisely,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.200]   then this will tie over to the income side.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.400]   So one of the things that is a very useful mental model,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.600]   some people will look at things from the perspective of
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.800]   how can I fund things off of an investment portfolio.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.000]   But if you want to live a family adventure of some kind,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.200]   that doesn't necessarily have to be the only way to fund things.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   We need cash flow.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.600]   So all financial planning is based around cash flow.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.800]   If you and your wife needed $1,400 a month to live on your sailboat
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.000]   after you had purchased it with your family,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.200]   then all you need to be able to do that is $1,400 a month.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.400]   That $1,400 a month, if you had $14,000 sitting in a bank
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.600]   and you're spending $1,400 a month,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.800]   now we have 10 months worth of expenses.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   So we have 10 months worth of freedom.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   And that's going to be coming from many other sources.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.400]   If you had Social Security income of $1,400 a month,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.600]   that could provide it.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.800]   Most people, unless you're disabled,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.000]   I had somebody I worked with actually who was disabled at an early age,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.200]   and they had under $1,000 a month, they lived on a sailboat.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.400]   And they traveled the Caribbean constantly, full-time,
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.600]   living on their sailboat, because that was how they could live
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.800]   a great life on their disability income.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So I encourage people, investing is a really important skill,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.200]   and it's awesome if you can fund an investment,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   if you can fund an adventure based upon investments.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.600]   Me, that's kind of the ultimate,
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.800]   because that's true financial independence,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.000]   when you don't have to do any work,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.200]   and your investment portfolio will build that for you.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.400]   But there are other ways to do it.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.600]   So you could have somebody who works occasionally.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   So if you earn $2,800 a month,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.000]   that means for every 6 months you work, and you can save $1,400,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.200]   you can buy 6 more months of not having to work,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.400]   as a very simple formula.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.600]   So sometimes occasional working.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.800]   Many people would love to be able to build their income online,
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.000]   and many people have done it.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.200]   So you can build some sort of business.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.400]   So this could be a so-called location-independent business,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   - Yeah, that list might be longer.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   - It is far longer.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.000]   But sometimes focusing on a more local brick-and-mortar business
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.200]   might be more efficient.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.400]   As far as a useful kind of construct,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.600]   when you're looking at, and I just recorded a show about this,
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.800]   that hasn't been released yet,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.000]   but just kind of talking about the different ways of doing things.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.200]   There are fundamentally 3 different asset classes
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   that I'm aware of that big picture can be used.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.600]   And number 1 is entrepreneurship or business ownership,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.800]   number 2 is real estate,
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.000]   and number 3 is paper assets.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.200]   So entrepreneurship or business ownership,
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.400]   if it's appropriate for somebody's personality,
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.600]   can often have the highest potential rate of return.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.800]   So if somebody's saying, "OK, I'm able to save some money,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.000]   what's going to be my best investment?"
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   If it's appropriate for them,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.400]   building a business or an entrepreneurial endeavor of some kind
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.600]   can often be the highest rate of return
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.800]   because you can multiply the money incredibly massive.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.000]   The right investment in the right marketing program for your business
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.200]   may result in a thousands of percent rate of return.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.400]   So it's got opportunities for just massive growths
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.600]   if the business is successful.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.800]   It's also got tremendous opportunities for tax advantages.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   One of my personal pet peeves and personal passions
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.200]   is actually tax planning
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.400]   because the more money you save on taxes
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.600]   is more money that you can spend.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.800]   So instead of the government stealing the money out of your pocket
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.000]   and spending it on all the stuff that it spends the money on,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.200]   much of which in my opinion is a total waste,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.400]   then you can spend it on what you want to spend it on.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.600]   People often talk about tax breaks for the rich.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   The trick is, however, there are two different almost segments
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.000]   of the tax code.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.200]   This is not actual, this is more metaphorical.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.400]   There's a personal tax code and there's a business tax code
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600]   and all the good stuff is in the business tax code.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.800]   So if you build out some kind of entrepreneurial endeavor,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.000]   I like to use a simple example.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.200]   If you are one who is making a legitimate income
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.400]   writing and selling travel books,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   you can avoid the taxes on some portion of those tax expenses.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.800]   It's a very involved process to do it carefully
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.000]   and to do it appropriately
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.200]   where you have good records and you're in good shape.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.400]   But that trip that I said
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.600]   where I took the two weeks and traveled,
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.800]   that was a 100% deductible expense for me
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.000]   because I was attending two business conferences
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.200]   that were 100% related to my business.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   So I was able to get a good record
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   and I was able to get a good record
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.800]   and I was able to get a good record
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.000]   and I was able to get a good record
