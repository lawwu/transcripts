[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Here's what I noticed in my cursory examination of media coverage of Elon Musk and Twitter
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.600]   is that essentially a decision has been made that Elon Musk is public enemy number one
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   and it has led to news coverage that I find to be both boring and ironic.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:39.080]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 224.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.900]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined by my producer Jesse.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.500]   As Jesse will attest, I was late getting here today.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.780]   I want to mention why because I think there's a general point relevant to the topics we
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.280]   talk about here on the show.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.000]   Here was the mistake I made today.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.520]   I had about an hour to kill before needing to start prepping for the podcast recording
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.800]   today.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   And I had an idea that is common among people who are working on long-term projects that
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.080]   require deep work.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.520]   This ambitious optimistic idea that you know what I'll do?
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.480]   I'll write for an hour.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.120]   I'm working on a book, listeners know this, I'm writing a book on slow productivity and
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.160]   I figured I want to get an hour in writing because I have this little window before I
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.360]   move on to other things.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880]   That never works.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.360]   So an hour goes by and now I'm up to my cognitive ears, my proverbial ears in this argument
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360]   I'm trying to make.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   And here's the real issue.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.320]   The argument I was trying to make wasn't working.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.800]   And that's the worst case scenario from actually keeping deep work in a tightly constrained
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.700]   box is when what you're working on, the cognitive puzzle you're working on isn't quite working.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.620]   Your brain basically refuses any alternative but to make this function because there's
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.660]   an unease if you're writing.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.060]   I'm sure this is the same for people who are putting together code or working on some other
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.140]   type of creative process.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.220]   There's this cognitive unease to this isn't quite working.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.700]   We have these pieces from this paragraph we've been working on for the last hour.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100]   They're all loaded up in our head.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.540]   They don't click together quite right.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.540]   That's very uneasy.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.380]   And our brain says we got to keep grinding on this until these things click and we get
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.380]   that relief of, okay, good.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.620]   We're at a stopping point.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.620]   This makes sense.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.660]   So when the hour passed, my pieces weren't fitting.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.540]   My brain was revolting and I had to keep writing.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.220]   Then eventually I had to write Jesse and say, look, I'm running late.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.220]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220]   I just got, I got caught up writing.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.260]   It's a reminder that an hour is not enough time for most deep work activities because
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.100]   it takes 20 minutes to get loaded up and man, that's not enough time.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.900]   If what you're working on is not making progress, good luck stopping.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.220]   So there would be a little bit of planning optimism that came back to bite me.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.900]   So a case study, Jesse, my own struggles is a lesson that everyone else can learn from.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.060]   What's the optimal, what's the minimum time for writing?
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.340]   I mean, for me, for book writing, I need two hours, maybe two and a half hours for that
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.440]   particular activity.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.340]   There's other deep work activities I can get in and out in 90 minutes, which is the minimum
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.340]   I usually say.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.380]   There's other activities I can do it, but they're typically activities where it's clearly
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.380]   encapsulated.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.260]   Like, yeah, in 90 minutes of which maybe 60 will be hard thinking, you'll be able to make
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.260]   progress.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.260]   There'll be a clear stopping point.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.580]   You know, uh, brainstorming is sometimes like this.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.140]   Sometimes if I have a, a, a proof idea, that's pretty for my mathematics work, that's pretty
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140]   concise.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.980]   I was like, I got to just write this down and I know it'll take an hour.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.980]   That's fine.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.180]   But if I'm starting from scratch to try to make an argument, I need two hours or two
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   and a half hours.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.680]   So I'm going to try to write after this today.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.340]   That's not my optimal time, but I, I'm going to throw a ritual at it.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280]   I'm not going to touch my email inboxes.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.660]   I want to go complete context shift from our work to getting in a writing block.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.260]   Maybe I'll go to a different location, but I want to, I want to solve this puzzle.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.740]   So we're going to, I'm going to try a little off schedule writing time for me.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.620]   It's like the, uh, potion from episode two 23.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.620]   Yes.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.580]   When I was establishing myself as awesome and not a nerd where we talked about Felix,
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.580]   wait, Felix Felicity, it's Felicity.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.580]   I don't know.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.300]   We'll see if we get email about that, but yeah, this was okay.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.980]   If you listen to the last, uh, podcast where I was being awesome because I was referencing
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.540]   Harry Potter, I was saying the way people time block too often is with huge optimism.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.380]   And so it's a plan of in a perfect world.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.700]   If they were taking that potion from Harry Potter six in a perfect world, how they would
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.400]   want their day to unfold, not the reality.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.660]   That was me this morning.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.280]   It was, I was Harry Potter as a Harry Potter.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.780]   If he had not successfully use the potion instructions from the half blood princes,
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.140]   potion making manual that won him in slug horns class, the, the good luck potion, which
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.260]   gave him that good luck day.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.840]   It would be as if Harry Potter never actually found or use those instructions.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.660]   If he had listened to Hermione's reprimand that you should try to do your work on your
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.620]   own without the help and did not get the potion.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.280]   That was me this morning when I optimistically said, I'm sure I can get an hour of intro
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   writing done.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   No problem.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.780]   Cut it off after an hour and get right back to podcasting.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.180]   But I did not have that potion.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.700]   I did not get it done.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.300]   Oh man, that cracks me up.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300]   That's so good.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   Harry Potter.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.300]   Jesse loves when I talk Harry Potter.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.820]   Cause even when I was editing up stuff for YouTube for two 23, I heard you say it again
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.060]   and again, and I was dying every time.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   It's so good.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.740]   You know, there's these, it's true though.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.260]   In the early days of podcasting, some of the monster, some of the monster podcast out there,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.100]   I'm talking like Oh seven, right.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.700]   Where Harry Potter podcast, like that was, these were like the original deep dive on
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.700]   a topic podcast.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.340]   That's normal now, but pre the major podcast revolution, you had these podcasts like Melissa
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.900]   Anelli's the leaky cauldron, and I read her book at some point where they would just obsess
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.620]   over like every detail about Harry Potter is like the original intersection of fan culture
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.620]   and podcasting.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.140]   I don't know if that's still a thing because I guess the books are over, but yeah, what
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.940]   I'm trying to say, Jesse is I think we should change format.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.940]   There is a gap in the world of hardcore Harry Potter podcasting that we can go and refill
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.020]   throw a little nationals baseball and then we'll be golden nationals baseball.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.380]   So there's a long list of things that our listeners write in and say, please stop talking
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.820]   about this.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.060]   Baseball is very high up on the list.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.460]   I think we can get Harry Potter on that list pretty quickly.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   I think a couple more segments, a couple more segments.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.220]   We will have our readers begging us stop.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.620]   Stop talking about Harry Potter.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.780]   All right.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.460]   Well, speaking of topics that our listeners sometimes say, stop talking about, I do, I
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.700]   am going to want to do a deep dive here shortly about Twitter.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.140]   I do feel somewhat obligated to talk about it given my background on this topic and current
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.660]   events, but worry not.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.460]   As you will see, we are going to take an oblique angle onto this topic.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.220]   We're going to come at it from a different angle, so hopefully we'll get somewhere new
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.220]   later in the show.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.540]   We also have another live caller.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.100]   So this is where I get to go back and forth with one of the deep questions, listeners
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.700]   and help them in real time with their issue.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.020]   We have a great collection of just old fashioned voice and written questions.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.860]   And at the end of the show today, we have a segment that I call three interesting things
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.580]   where I take three things from the world of, I don't know, entertainment, media, literature,
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.460]   et cetera, that caught my attention this week.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.340]   And I will go through all three briefly.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.100]   So maybe point you towards some interesting ideas or things to consume in the week ahead.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.700]   All right, Jesse, sound like a plan?
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   Yeah, sounds great.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.500]   All right, well, let's go on to our deep dive.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.940]   I'm calling this one a world without Twitter.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:08:01.300]   So I made what's perhaps the mistake of checking in this week on media coverage of Twitter,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.460]   Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, what's going on there.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.100]   I regret it.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.940]   I kind of want those 30 minutes of my life back.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.740]   Here's what I noticed in my cursory examination of media coverage of Elon Musk and Twitter
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:24.380]   is that essentially a decision has been made that Elon Musk is public enemy number one.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.340]   And it has led to news coverage that I find to be both boring and ironic.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.600]   So I think it's boring because what we have is just everyone lining up to take their shot
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.280]   at attacking Musk and why he's bad, right?
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.180]   So there's a pinata hanging, a proverbial pinata hanging, and there's a full consensus
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.340]   that this is a bad pinata that is going to destroy democracy.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.220]   So I don't know where you buy your pinatas from, but don't buy it from that store.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.420]   And everyone's just lining up to take their take.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.860]   Now, why this is ironic is because it feels as if this consensus of, you know, he is bad
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:05.500]   guy number one needs to go away was formed on Twitter, is being enforced on Twitter.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.420]   And after everyone takes their turn with their takedown piece on Musk, they then return to
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.140]   Twitter to see if they're getting enough lottets or how much celebration they're getting.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.860]   So it's this weird sort of incestual circularity going on where all these reporters are obsessed
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.300]   with Twitter.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.980]   That obsession with Twitter is fueling their takedown of Twitter on which they're seeing
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.140]   what the reaction is to their takedown of Twitter.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.540]   All of it's all mixed up and it's just uninteresting to me.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.300]   So I thought, let me come at this topic from a different angle.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.420]   So one of the discussions that's happening, which I think is more interesting, is will
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.300]   we see a viable alternative to Twitter emerge?
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.140]   And in particular, there's a strain of conversation that's big right now that's saying, will the
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:10:00.020]   potential fall of Twitter lead to the rise of one of the independent social media alternatives?
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.060]   So these independent social media alternatives that are not massive platform monopolies owned
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.060]   by billionaires.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.020]   Now, I don't want to act as if I'm ahead of all trends, but I do want to point towards
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.500]   an article I wrote for the New Yorker back in 2019.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.060]   I'm loading this on the tablet now for people who are watching at youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.020]   This was actually my first article I ever wrote for the New Yorker.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:33.940]   It is from May of 2019 and the title is, "Can Indie Social Media Save Us?"
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.980]   So the point of this article was to look at this subset of the social media universe which
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.860]   had been overlooked, which is independent social media services, small, often open source
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.780]   social media alternatives.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.300]   At the time, there wasn't much discussion of these.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   Today there is.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:56.180]   And in particular, in the last new cycle or two, there's been a lot of focus on one particular
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.220]   independent social media service called Mastodon.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.860]   I'm going to scroll here in this article to show you that Mastodon is something I mentioned
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.860]   about.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.860]   So here we go.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.900]   From my piece, "Mastodon, another popular indie web service, exists in the middle ground
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.980]   between centralized and decentralized social media."
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.580]   So I talked about Mastodon back in 2019 as a potential Twitter alternative.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.660]   So this is what I want to get into today.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.340]   How does Mastodon work?
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.420]   Will it emerge as a potential more independent alternative to what Twitter was doing?
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.540]   And if so, would that be better?
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.620]   And if not, what does that tell us?
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.820]   So how does Mastodon work?
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.740]   Will it become an alternative to Twitter?
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.300]   And then I'll return to what I wrote in this article.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.060]   We'll see how my conclusions from back then mesh with what I'm thinking today.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   All right.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.980]   So what is Mastodon?
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:53.780]   The right way to understand it is, it is an open source Twitter style service.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.180]   But unlike Twitter, it is distributed.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.060]   So there is open source software for running a Mastodon server.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.120]   Anyone can go and download the software.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.380]   They can install it on their own server and they can run a Mastodon server.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.540]   It's open source, so it's free.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.060]   You just have to give proper acknowledgement that, "Hey, this code comes from the Mastodon
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.060]   project."
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.140]   A little aside, there's a whole controversy that only really tech nerds understood.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.060]   But when Donald Trump first launched his social media network, Truth Social, they essentially
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.180]   just stole all the code from Mastodon without doing any of the acknowledgements.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.900]   And that created a bit of a problem.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.900]   That sounds familiar.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.020]   Anyways, so anyone can download the software, start their own server.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.420]   So Jesse and I could put a computer here in the studio and we could run a Mastodon server
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.820]   on it.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.180]   When you're running a Mastodon server, you can have users join, sign up, have a username
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.220]   for your server.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.280]   And what the server implements is something like Twitter.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.400]   You can post things on the server, up to 500 characters, and you can see what other people
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.300]   have posted in reverse chronological order.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:05.020]   So very much like a Twitter short form post reverse chron sorting type system.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.940]   It has a similar follower dynamic to Twitter as well.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.040]   So you can actually say, "Well, here are the people I want to actually follow.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.380]   So show me their posts when they come up in reverse chronological order.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.060]   I don't want to know about that person, et cetera."
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.580]   So that's the core of Mastodon.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.280]   I can start my own mini Twitter for free.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   Anyone can join it.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.700]   Typically, the way these servers are supported is a Patreon.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.700]   That's pretty common.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.740]   I mean, it's not super expensive to run one of these servers, but you might just ask the
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.120]   members, "Hey, can you kick in and donate?"
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.460]   So that's a nice benefit from those who are concerned about attention economy dynamics.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.820]   It's typically not ad based.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.980]   It's, you know, "Hey, this is going to cost whatever, a couple thousand dollars a year
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   to run.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.380]   Hey, users on my server, can you chip in some money?"
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.300]   Mastodon also comes with a protocol for different servers to talk to each other.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.300]   So now what can happen is, let's say you have an account on the server that Jesse and I
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.780]   have here in the studio, and there's whatever, a hundred users who use this server and you
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.900]   follow some of them and you post and it looks like Twitter.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.680]   You can follow people on other servers as well.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.380]   So let's say someone else we know has their own Mastodon server and someone else who's
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.940]   interesting, who you find to be more interesting than Jesse and I, is over on that other server.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.580]   So maybe you're like, "You know, I kind of like the Cal and Jesse server, a lot of Harry
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.460]   Potter talk going on.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.300]   Not so sure that I only want to hear what they have to say, but someone else we like
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.140]   is on another Mastodon server."
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.740]   You can say, "I want to follow them."
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.960]   And this protocol, what it will do is basically your server will then talk to that other server
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.220]   and say, "Hey, we have someone over here who cares about a user of yours.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.840]   Let us know when they post things."
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.020]   And so now I can see posts from other servers show up in my feed.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   All right.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.980]   So it's a distributed solution.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.140]   Individuals run these servers, but the servers can talk to each other.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:00.060]   So I can see what people post on other servers if I choose to follow them and send a request.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   That's Mastodon.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.040]   It has a real community niche feel.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.500]   So traditionally each individual Mastodon server, which are called instances in Mastodon
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.460]   speak, will develop their own often quite complex community standards.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.000]   That's the whole feel of Mastodons.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.140]   Over here we have very specific rules about what you can and can't talk about.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.440]   Over here they might be different.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.420]   This is similar a little bit to what we see with Reddit and subreddits.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.040]   We get these very specific community standards that exist on different reddits.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.300]   As has become clear in the recent news cycles, it also has very powerful banning type features.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.060]   So you can easily as an admin kick people off your instance.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:45.020]   You can also block people on your server from following anyone from another server.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:52.540]   So I can, if I run the Jesse Cal server and I don't like this rival Harry Potter server,
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.740]   I can ban that server, which means no one on my server is allowed to follow anyone from
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.740]   that server.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.940]   You can also ban individuals.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.340]   No one on my server can follow this particular individual.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.360]   So there's a lot of power the admins have to control not just what's posted, but who
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.820]   the people on their server can actually follow or receive information from.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.900]   All right, so that's basically how Mastodon works.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.080]   So it is Twitter, but it has its own thing going on.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.560]   Back to my 2019 article, I'll just show a couple things I wrote about Mastodon back
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   then.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:34.880]   So one thing I wrote in that article is because most Mastodon instances are small, typically
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.560]   each number is a couple thousands of users and crowdfunded by their members, they feel
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.040]   different from mass social media with an enticing free form energy reminiscent of the internet's
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.520]   early days.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.800]   The contrast between this atmosphere and the one found on existing social networks is striking.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.080]   So you definitely get this feel.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.160]   I hung out a lot on Mastodon when I was writing that 2019 article.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.560]   It feels like early web stuff.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.120]   Very specific niche communities, very specific rules.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.880]   Reminiscent of the textual conventions of Usenet news groups or the weird acronyms that
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.600]   were developed, the standards that were developed on early bulletin boards like The Well.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.360]   Here's a more concrete summary I gave from that experience.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.760]   Mastodon, at least for now, is a human scale environment in which users are happy to chat
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.720]   about quirky things with other quirky people.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.960]   Recently when I logged into the Mastodon instance sunbeam.city, a "libertarian socialist solar
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.820]   punk" instance, I found a photo of someone's blooming spider plant next to a conversation
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.080]   about the consequences of ethical transparency in hierarchical systems.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.680]   It struck me as the quintessential early internet experience.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.880]   So that's what Mastodon looked like to me in 2019.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.080]   It's like old Usenet boards.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.360]   It's cool.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.940]   Everyone's doing their own thing.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.800]   The following between servers didn't seem widespread.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.920]   It was more, "I like sunbeam.city.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.920]   I like these people.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.960]   We have our own quirky thing going on.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.800]   Let's just go hang out there."
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.520]   So a really good early web energy.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   Can this be a replacement for Twitter that doesn't have one person?
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.880]   Priorly, that might've been Jack Dorsey.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.880]   Today it's Elon Musk.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.720]   Can we have a version of Twitter then where there is no one person, some sort of utopian
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.400]   alternative to Twitter?
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:33.080]   Find these good vibes I picked up in 2019 scale to be a Twitter-size impact on the internet.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.960]   And here my argument is no.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.200]   Mastodon will never be Twitter.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.680]   It will never have its same significance or its same audience.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.640]   The reason for this, and as I've talked about before on this show, Twitter is incredibly
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.620]   successful because it is a finely tuned engagement machine.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.440]   That is very difficult to do.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.840]   So we've gone into this before, but at the core of Twitter success is three elements.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.880]   One that it has a massive user base that includes many potentially interesting people with engaging
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   things to say.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.920]   So you need a huge foundation of potentially interesting people with potentially interesting
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   things to say.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.320]   And I'm using interesting here in a completely value neutral manner.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.020]   It could be interesting means engaging.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.560]   So it could be outrageous.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.000]   It could be shocking or it could be funny or it could be very smart.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.640]   So you have comedians, you have expert commentators, you have celebrity figures, you have figures
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.920]   who have interesting takes on different aspects of the culture.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   This huge user base.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.800]   Number two, Twitter has this massive social graph where all of these people have painstakingly
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.920]   defined these one-on-one dyadic follower connections.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.800]   This creates this densely connected social graph that is encoding these type of social
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.520]   cultural capital relations.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.040]   I'm following you because of all these subtle things I know about you and your standing
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.960]   in society or the content that you produce.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.320]   You combine that with the retweet button and they come together to give you this sort of
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.440]   emergent distributed curation algorithm that's fantastically effective.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.460]   So you have all these interesting people throwing out potentially effective things.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.480]   Then you have the cumulative impact of 237 million users clicking retweet in this complex
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.520]   social graph and what emerges is this really successful filtering function where stuff
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.620]   that's engaging is identified and spread.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.760]   As a result, if you click that Twitter app on your phone, its ability to show you thing
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.800]   after thing after thing that's going to capture your attention, that you could lose hours
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.880]   into is almost unparalleled.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.920]   Instagram can do this pretty well with a similar sort of setting.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.760]   Facebook used to do this pretty well but is now struggling.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.640]   TikTok is doing this very well as we've talked about before.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.360]   They've replaced this human-centric distributed curation with pure algorithmic curation, but
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.880]   it works pretty well in the sense of you can get lost in TikTok even more effectively than
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   Twitter.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.780]   But very few people can do this.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.120]   It is a tight wire act.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.800]   It is very difficult to pull off.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.240]   This I can get lost in hour streaming, almost everything I see scrolling on this app is
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   going to catch my attention in some way.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.160]   Mastodon can't replicate that.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.200]   It doesn't have enough critical mass of interesting people.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.280]   It doesn't have this existing deep complex follower social graph which does a really
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   good job of amplifying things.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.080]   In fact, the dynamics of the Mastodon, there's a few choices that they've made specifically
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.800]   and by they, there's an actual founder, Eugene Rochko.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.400]   They've made these decisions to try to cut down on virality.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.480]   You can't quote tweet people, whatever they call it, a Mastodon quote post people.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.160]   It's difficult to spread other people's things.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.280]   Eugene wanted it to be more people just talking back and forth.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.480]   It's difficult to do threads.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.040]   You have all this dynamic of very niche content moderation and banning back and forth between
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   different people.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.680]   So you don't have that virality.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.580]   You don't have the core of interesting people.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.920]   So what you don't get on Mastodon is that experience of I open that app and I am engaged
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.800]   for as long as I want to scroll.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.160]   What I saw when I was on Mastodon, which I think is true of the experience today is you
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.580]   enter a conversation with a community.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.720]   Most of the stuff you see is not that interesting.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.840]   It's more about going back and forth with people that over time you get to know and
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.200]   you find interesting things.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.420]   You have to do a lot of work.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.520]   You have to do a lot of sifting.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.880]   That's early web stuff and it's cool.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.360]   But from a pure engagement perspective, can't hold a candle to Twitter.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.480]   No one is going to fall down a Mastodon rabbit hole hours at an end as reporter after reporter
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.520]   is realizing as they write about this service.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   It's actually kind of hard to spend a lot of time on Mastodon.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.920]   It's like a Usenet news group in the early days.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   It's like the well.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.960]   There's some cool stuff.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.000]   You meet some cool people.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.820]   Most of it's not that engaging.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.360]   So no, I don't think Mastodon is going to be a replacement for Twitter.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   Is that a problem?
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.840]   I would say no.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.480]   I don't think we need a replacement for Twitter.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.540]   There is a great danger in taking essentially the entire populace of internet users and
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.360]   putting them all together on a homogenized interface.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.120]   Everyone has easy access, the exact same accounts, all information looks the same, the network
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.820]   of connections through which information is being amplified, the curation is happening
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.620]   on the scale of hundreds of millions of users.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.400]   I think that is a dangerous recipe.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.800]   I think that is a dangerous recipe.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.680]   It does not play well with the human social brain.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:46.880]   It creates the virality dynamics, create these, as we've seen intense tribal pressures, intense
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.280]   psychological distress.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.080]   Yes, it's very engaging to look at Twitter, but Twitter of the last three or four years
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   has become engaging in the same way that the Roman Coliseum was engaging.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.440]   It's more about watching gladiators from your tribe do battles from gladiators from the
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.440]   other tribe.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.760]   Revelling in the outrage when someone from your tribe is being unfairly speared with
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.860]   the proverbial trident and the people commenting on how unfair this is, celebrating when your
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.880]   team gets someone from the other team.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.520]   We found an angle of attack.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.580]   We threw that net thing around them and dragged them into the lion pit.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.680]   It's spectacle.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.440]   It's a spectacle of the elites, as I said in a recent New Yorker piece.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.840]   Yeah, it's engaging, but we don't need that type of engagement.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.400]   And I know there's lots of other arguments in favor of Twitter.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.320]   Journalists like it because it helps them find what's going on in the news.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.480]   I don't mind if you have to work harder to find out what's going in the news because
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.080]   the side effect of you all using the same platform is that everything becomes consensus.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   Everyone just says, what is our particular tribe in the world of media think about this?
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.400]   Great, let's go.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.440]   There's not enough interesting new angles.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.560]   There's not enough, I would say, diverse viewpoints of world events.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.240]   It all just breaks, balkanizes into three viewpoints and everyone goes back to the arena.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.360]   So I don't care if it's harder for you to find news.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.320]   Yeah, it can help you connect with interesting people.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.700]   There's other ways to connect with interesting people that aren't going to put your blood
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.640]   pressure through the roof.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.560]   That's not going to give you a low grade anxiety disorder like Twitter can do.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.000]   Mastodon is great for that.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.640]   Join an instance, have several instances of affinity groups related to things you care
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   about.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.280]   You can build really interesting relationships there.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   It's a small scale.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.000]   It's a human style scale, but it's connecting you to people that you never otherwise would
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.440]   have found without the internet.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   That's brilliant social internet possibility at work without those downsides of Twitter.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.200]   And the engagement part of Twitter, find other things that are engaging.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.840]   Read books, watch streaming shows, listen to episode after episode of the Deep Questions
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.240]   podcast, do stuff in the real world, make more Harry Potter references.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.120]   I don't know.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.720]   The fact that this is engaging is not enough of a justification for we should keep it around.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.760]   So I don't think Mastodon can replace Twitter, but I don't think we need anything to replace
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   Twitter.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.600]   So let me go back to the conclusion I made in that 2019 article.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.100]   Let's see if I was clairvoyant or not.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.840]   So I did say the internet may work better when it's spread out as originally designed.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.880]   So I like this idea of more distributed, more niche, less universal.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.520]   But then I conclude, despite its advantages, however, I suspect that the Indie web will
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.000]   not succeed in replacing existing social media platforms at their current scale.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.280]   For one thing, the Indie web lacks the carefully engineered addictiveness that helped fuel
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.200]   the rise of services like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.280]   This addictiveness has kept people returning to their devices even when they know there
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   are better uses for their time.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.840]   Remove the addiction and you might lose the users.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   All right.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   I think that's just another way of saying what I'm saying today.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.160]   Those existing giants were fantastically effective at generating engagement in the social media
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   world.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.380]   If you can't compete, get rid of the engagement, you lose most of the users.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.720]   As I go on to say, though, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.800]   It may be too that people who are uneasy about social media aren't looking for a better version
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.820]   of it, but are instead ready to permanently reduce the role that their smartphones play
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.600]   in their lives.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:21.580]   What I think is the most hopeful potential conclusion here is, sure, there's alternatives.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.640]   Some people who are into social internet stuff can find actually healthier, more community-driven,
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.020]   more eccentric, original, early web-style online communities, and I'm glad those exist.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.360]   Most people will say if Twitter fell, "I'm not going to sign up for a Mastodon instance,"
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.680]   and honestly, it's kind of nice to be able to hear the birds again and see the sunshine.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.760]   I'm sort of glad this thing is gone.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.860]   I don't need a replacement.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.860]   So that's where I fall.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:51.060]   No, we're not going to see an obvious replacement for Twitter, and I don't care that that might
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.720]   end up being the reality that we go into next.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   I mean, the real question, Jesse, is, is Twitter going to go away?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   I'm not convinced.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   It's hard for me to tell.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.240]   >>Jesse Nichols I don't think it's going to go away.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.900]   >>Dave Portnoy There's issues about engineering.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.480]   This is the conversation right now is because so many people are being fired that it'll
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.560]   literally crash.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.760]   Putting those aside, it's an engagement engine like almost no one else.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.880]   For people who are too old or, I'll get yelled at for this, or have too much self-respect
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.960]   to be on TikTok, it's the next most addictive thing they have.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.720]   I mean, it's an incredibly engaging thing, especially if you're a well-educated, upper
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.040]   middle class, sort of elite knowledge worker type.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.920]   It's put it in my veins engagement.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.200]   There's very few things that can compete with that.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.840]   It's really hard.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.400]   That's my thing is that engagement requires all of these elements to come together.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.840]   A lot of them relied on first mover advantages.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.920]   237 million users that include all these interesting people.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.240]   This incredibly valuable social graph, the interface retweet dynamic that does such a
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.360]   good job of curation.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   It's hard to do that.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.200]   So, yeah, I'm kind of with you.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.160]   I mean, unless Musk shuts it down, like the tech crashes and he says enough of it, let's
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   just shut it down, which I don't think is going to happen.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.600]   >>Jesse Nichols He wouldn't waste $40 billion to do that?
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.400]   >>Ted Whittaker Yeah, he has his debt service on his Twitter
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   act is acquisitions a billion dollars a year.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   He owes a billion dollars a year just to service the debt on Twitter.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.480]   So I don't think he's going to do that.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.040]   I think what's going to happen is, and it's something I talked about a while ago, is that
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.940]   Twitter was actually well positioned to be taken private like he did.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.000]   It could easily be something that generates a couple billion dollars a year in revenue,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.480]   pretty sleekly with really high profit margins, which is really all Musk needs out of it.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.120]   So once you lose that ambition that Facebook has to be a trillion dollar valuation company,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.040]   which was their ambition before the wheels fell off, once you're like, we don't have
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   to be a trillion dollar competitor to Apple, once it's, you know, hey, this thing generates
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.160]   $2.5 billion a year off of 150 million really engaged users, and it has a sleek background,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.320]   and we have a 2000 employee company, and it's, you know, we can service our debt and it makes
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   good profit for the people who own it.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.840]   I mean, I'm sure that's the play.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.560]   The question is like whether he's all there.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.600]   That's the only, that's the only eight ball here.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   I don't know.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.360]   It's hard to tell because everything's so negative on Musk right now.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.980]   I mean, if he's literally losing his grip mentally, then God knows what will happen.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.960]   But if we, if we assume a strategic Musk, I don't think it's that hard to make this
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.920]   a sleek, profitable, semi niche service.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   It's not trying to be TikTok or Facebook.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.120]   It's not trying to be mastodon.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.280]   It's somewhere in between and generates like a reasonable amount of money for a small number
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   of people.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   That's probably where it'll end up.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.800]   You should ask your boy Lex.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.080]   Yeah, yeah, I should.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.880]   I think, I think Lex is buddies with Elon.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.440]   Yeah, he's on a show.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   I think they're, I think they're buddies.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   I'll ask him.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.760]   I'll say, what's, what's going on here?
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.760]   All right.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.680]   So I want to get to a live caller.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   Enough about me.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   Let's get to a live caller.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.080]   First, let me briefly mention a sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   That is our friends at Wren, W R E N.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.640]   So when we're looking at climate change as an issue, it can be paralyzing for people.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.080]   First of all, you have all the political valency surrounding it, but even when you strip that
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.760]   off, it can be somewhat crippling to think, what, what should I do?
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   What can I do?
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.120]   It might seem like there's no first step you can take and action follows.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.640]   Wren has a good solution for that.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.800]   A good solution for you, breaking the seal on taking productive action.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.840]   Their theory is if you take one small step towards something you care about, it's much
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.520]   easier to take many more steps down the line.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.480]   So what Wren helps you do, it's a website that helps you calculate your personal carbon
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.440]   footprint based on details about your lifestyle.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.640]   And then you can offset that carbon footprint with funding projects that plant trees, protect
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.720]   rainforests, sequester CO2, et cetera.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:04.040]   So instead of a, just having implicit tools at your disposal, like what if I change something
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.160]   about my car or this or that you can get right to the heart of it.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.560]   How do I take this much carbon out of the air?
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.600]   There's projects that can do that right away.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   Let me directly fund it.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.080]   I think it's a very smart idea to help people take those first steps towards taking action
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.960]   on something that they care about.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.000]   Wren describes their goal as unlocking the collective action of millions of individuals
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.200]   to drive the systemic change needed to end the climate crisis.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.760]   So signing up for Wren is an easy way to do something meaningful about this crisis.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.440]   So it's going to take all of us to face these types of big issues.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.520]   So you should do your part today by signing up for Wren.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:49.400]   Go to Wren.co/deep, sign up, and they will plant an extra 10 extra trees in your name.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:54.640]   That's W-R-E-N.co/deep.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.240]   Don't forget the slash deep.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.880]   Don't forget it's C-O instead of com.com.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.160]   So that's Wren.co/deep.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.380]   Go there to start making a difference.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.000]   Also want to talk about our friends at Ladder.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.720]   Ladder is the place to get affordable life insurance.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.320]   So a lot of you out there know that you need life insurance, but have been procrastinating
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.280]   on this because you're thinking, how do I get started?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.200]   Do I go to a insurance salesman somewhere?
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   Where is this person?
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.720]   Are they going to be out of the 1970s?
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.220]   How does this even work?
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.400]   This is where Ladder enters the picture.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.680]   It is 100% digital, no doctors, no needles, no paperwork.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.960]   When you apply for $3 million in coverage or less, you just answer a few questions about
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.080]   your health in an application, and they will use their smart algorithms to come back and
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:55.320]   tell you if you're improved or not, and give you good insurance options to choose from.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   You just need a few minutes and a phone or laptop to apply.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.080]   All of their policies are issued by insurers with long proven histories of paying claims.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.480]   They're rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.540]   So this just makes the life insurance question easy.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:15.720]   If you need life insurance, pause the podcast right now, go to ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.520]   In minutes, you could have taken care of this issue.

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep, ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:40.120]   All right, Jesse, I'm liking the live interaction we've put into the show.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.600]   Last week, we had our friend David Sachs in the studio helping us answer some questions.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.720]   Today, let's take a live call from one of our listeners.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.080]   Yep, we've got Philip here.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.000]   So let's take a listen.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.700]   All right, Philip, thanks for calling into the podcast.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.120]   What is on your mind today?
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.760]   Hey, Cal.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.920]   So I've been recently going through a bit of a life shift.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.520]   I spent a few years as an entrepreneur running two venture capital backed startups.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.400]   Then after selling my last company, I worked in product management roles at a couple of
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.640]   later stage technology startups for a few years.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.280]   And that was a lot of hyperactive hive mind, over 100 Slack channels or 30 meetings per
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.280]   week.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.080]   A lot of structured what I was working on also, though.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.600]   And so now I've split out to start a new company.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.520]   And my goal is to build it solo without external funding, kind of base camp style.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.840]   And I'm spending about half of my time doing consulting work to cover costs.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   And I'm spending the other half of my time developing my own in-house products.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.120]   The goal is to grow these in-house products and revenue so I can eventually focus on them
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   more full time.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.760]   And I split out solo because I did some value based lifestyle centric career planning and
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.520]   decided that starting a solo product development studio aligns more with the values and lifestyle
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.380]   that I wanted to pursue.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.920]   So my high level question is like, how do I apply the principles of slow productivity
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.680]   and deep life to set myself up for success?
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.200]   I've gone from a lot of structure to no structure, and I could use some help making sure that
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.720]   my habits are sustainable.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.520]   Well, I mean, first of all, I'm upset that you're not using our acronym for that.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   VBLCCP.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520]   VBLCCP.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.920]   I mean, we got to be pithy.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.360]   I think we all agree that that rolls off the tongue.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.360]   Okay.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.520]   This is a great question.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:26.960]   Tell me a little bit more though about this studio situation you have set up.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   What's that like?
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.760]   So what's the work going to be like?
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.800]   So I'm doing some product development.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.320]   So I'm working with a client, kind of building an entire application and end including like
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.600]   definition and design and things like that.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.200]   And I'm working on a couple of personal projects, like one of which is the main focus already
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.440]   has revenue, already has some customers.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.160]   It's not quite like revenue to live off of.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.280]   This is a path I used to start my previous company, Moonlight.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.600]   So we did some freelancing as we grew the company and eventually it grew in size and
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.440]   phrase venture capital and kind of took a traditional kind of path.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.560]   And I think a lot of what I'm trying to do with this product studio is also not necessarily
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.360]   trying to pursue that traditional path.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.920]   There's a lot of kind of extrinsic markers of success.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.400]   Like you could go raise money and hire employees and things like that.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.120]   I'm trying to be a little bit more controlled about that.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.560]   So my day to day is really unstructured.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   I have full control of my time now.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.400]   I have one client meeting per week, which is a lot less than what I had at later stage
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.320]   startups.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.080]   So I'm intending to break my day into three, two hour deep work blocks with kind of two
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   hours in between each for a mix of admin work and breaks.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.180]   So I guess kind of like a general high level question I have is, is this too much or too
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.760]   little deep work in a given day?
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   And with more control of my time, is it better to break up my day more or to try to keep
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.400]   deep work and more work admin work focused on more of a traditional kind of nine to five
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   slots?
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   Yep.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.400]   That's a good, that's a good question.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   And we'll get in this nitty gritty.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:06.440]   I want to underscore first, I like your decision you made of, well, let's keep this small.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.800]   Have you read Paul Jarvis, The Company of One?
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.280]   Yeah, I've read part of it.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.680]   I don't think I finished it, but it's a good book.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.160]   I mean, you're right in line, I think, with Paul's thinking here.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   If people haven't read that, they should.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.560]   It has a blurb for me, so you know that it's quality.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.400]   Paul also, he was a designer, I guess he was in web design.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.560]   And the whole book is about instead of expanding your company, so companies that begin with
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.640]   you and your skill, instead of expanding it, they hit those intrinsic markers of success,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.840]   so size, revenue, then funding.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.200]   His whole point is keep it small.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.280]   If you get more in demand, you can just charge more and therefore even work less.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.160]   Like actually, it can be a great engine for a lifestyle that you have a huge amount of
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   autonomy over.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.280]   And I think it's a great model.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.560]   So in terms of your specific day, there's no right answer to the exact right way to
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.240]   move deep work around how many blocks to have.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.480]   I have a couple things I'm going to throw out there, a couple heuristics, and you can
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.840]   see which of these might stick.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.520]   I'm a big believer in these situations of doing meeting-free Monday and Friday, if you
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   can.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.640]   So you just have the scheduling heuristic that client calls, client meetings, you know, whatever.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.960]   I got to call my accountant.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.280]   We got the IT person's upgrading some sort of software, whatever it is, nothing gets
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.320]   scheduled for Monday and Fridays.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.720]   That alone just changes the character of the week because it's like you have a four-day
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   weekend.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.000]   You're just deep working on Friday.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.280]   You're deep working on Monday.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.360]   You can really get lost in things.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.080]   So I think that can make a big difference.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.440]   And then the other thing I might suggest would be consolidating the deep work.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.520]   All right.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.040]   Deep work to lunch, meetings, clients, administrative stuff in the afternoon.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:57.760]   Trying to keep that together, keep that mindset going, and not have anything interspersed
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.240]   into that that's unrelated.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.200]   So those are two heuristics I've seen.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.760]   Would that graft well onto your current setup?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.520]   Some, yeah.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.880]   I really wanted to live more asynchronously when I started this company.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.680]   So I only have one meeting per week normally.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   All right.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   That's easy.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   So that makes it easier.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.560]   But that also is a lot more uncertainty in terms of should every day kind of be the same
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.360]   or kind of create more texture throughout the week.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   But yeah.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:31.920]   So you think that kind of training to do longer periods of deep work is better?
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.840]   I would do it first thing in the day until lunch.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.960]   Maybe just make that be a standard.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.480]   And then the other thing I would do, I mean, you have a very enviable situation here.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.720]   You have a huge amount of autonomy in terms of demands on your time because of the way
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   you set this up.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.660]   So congratulations.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.160]   This is something I do during the summer.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.880]   Like when I'm a professor in the summer, I'm like you all the time.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.080]   So I have many fewer obligations.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   My time is very, very open.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.480]   And so I have the same concern about how to structure it.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.240]   It's deep work in the morning and then variable but clearly defined shutdowns.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.400]   That's another thing I lean into is I'm going to time block out my afternoon.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.200]   I'll be clear about when my shutdown is going to happen this afternoon.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.440]   And when I'm shut down complete, I'm not working on work anymore.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.200]   That can be really early some days.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   Right.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   So what this allows you to do is it's Tuesday.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.960]   I deep work till lunch and that went really well.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.400]   I don't have any particularly pressing administrative thing.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.680]   I'm going to do a formal schedule shutdown ritual at one o'clock.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.360]   And because I recognize, hey, this day is done and I feel good about it, I can really
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.720]   lean into those other hours to do other things.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.520]   Clearly unrelated to work or whatever.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.120]   And then on another day, you said, look, I got my call with my client and now I really
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.040]   got to figure out whatever this new software package.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.320]   And so this is going to take me till five and I'll do the clear shutdown then.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.800]   But having the clearly defined shutdown each day, I mean, allows you to really work with
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.680]   this variable workflow and take a lot more advantage of what it gives you.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.000]   I mean, maybe you want to become a cinephile.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.880]   It's like, great, two days a week I'm going to the movies at the two o'clock show or whatever.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   You know, that's the type of thing you can do when you feel like I shut down.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.320]   I feel comfortable shutting down.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.760]   I'm looking at my schedule.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   This is good.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.120]   I'm on track for things.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.240]   And so now I really have to figure out what to do with my time.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.720]   That's what I might also be concerned about if I was making sure it's not this hazy mix
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.840]   of work and non-work guilt in the afternoon.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.920]   Like I don't know, maybe I should go back on email.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.560]   What's going on?
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.920]   Be clear about it, but then be very comfortable taking advantage of all the advantages you
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   have.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.920]   Okay, great.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.440]   Another kind of question along the lines of slow productivity is should I work on weekends?
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.920]   So I'm trying to do some client work and some personal work.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.200]   So I am not sure if I should continue working on weekends right now.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.120]   I'm taking one day off per week, but I think there could be value in getting more done.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.160]   So how do you think about working on weekends?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.080]   Would it be the personal project that you're mainly doing on the weekends?
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.880]   Yeah, I think it's fine.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.200]   I mean, if you have the time and you find it interesting, I think you're smart to take,
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:11.680]   you know, whether it be Saturday or Sunday, a full day completely off is fine.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.480]   But if you're working on a personal project, I think that's fine.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   I typically will write on Sundays, for example.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.340]   I don't do any other work on the weekend.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.720]   So I'm not going to do CS work.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.280]   Producer Jesse knows I'm probably not going to answer emails about issues with the podcast,
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   whatever.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.240]   But I do write because that's a very personal activity for me.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.080]   It's meaningful to me.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.020]   It doesn't change me into a mindset of hyperactive hive mind.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:46.240]   So I think if your personal project is not throwing you back into a world of scheduling
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.680]   meetings and sending emails, but it's coding or is trying to master a new system, I think
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   that's completely fine.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.760]   I mean, if you enjoy it, go for it.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   Keep you one day off.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   I mean, I think you got this pretty well dialed in here, Philip, from what I'm hearing.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.800]   So one of the life buckets is community.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   I've moved around a lot.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.760]   I was a nomad for two years and I'm temporarily in a new city with my significant others and
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   grad school.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.040]   How do you think community should factor in for somebody in my situation?
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.160]   I think there's not a lot of local people that are in the same situation as me, but
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:26.480]   a lot of online communities tend to be more real time like Discord or Telegram.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.520]   And I don't want to have those kind of synchronous demands on my attention.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.080]   What do you think is a good way to kind of continue to have some community?
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.840]   Because I don't really have that from coworkers or from kind of other companies in the same
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.240]   situation through an investor or something like that.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   What city are you in?
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   I'm in Chicago.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   I mean, I think you should have community involvement.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.520]   I think they should have scheduled synchronous demands on your time and I think they should
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   be in person.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.680]   I think that's an important part of the human condition.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.920]   As I talk about in digital minimalism, it's actually the non-trivial sacrifice of time
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.200]   and attention on behalf of other people that makes that connection something that's valued
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.280]   by your brain.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.200]   And so I would put in that work now.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.880]   Now, are you saying your significant other is in grad school somewhere else or you came
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   to Chicago?
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.880]   Okay, that's good.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.880]   Yeah, we're here in Chicago.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   She's in school.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.520]   I think I agree with what you're saying.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.720]   I think what I'm having trouble with is finding peers.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.960]   There's a lot of people that are more advanced or learning from me.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:37.560]   But I think where I have issues is a lot of my kind of peers that I know are in other
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.520]   cities, not necessarily locally.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.240]   Well, I mean, I'm saying get entangled in some community involvement here unrelated
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   to your work.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   Okay.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   That makes sense.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   And I think it could be through fitness.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.140]   It could be through faith.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.320]   It could be through activity, whatever, trail running or whatever.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.220]   I mean, there's such a wide variety.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.360]   But I would anchor myself right away with or if you're into, I mentioned movie, you're
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.900]   into movies, like let me find a club that meets and does these things.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.020]   And that becomes the offshoot of making friends and people you end up spending time with one
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.020]   on one.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   I think that's really critical.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.080]   I would give it, I would recognize it's hard, right?
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.840]   Because we don't have like an app solution for that.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.720]   We can't just like swipe a thing and then like a friend comes over.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.360]   But I would put a lot of effort into that, especially if I'm new to a city.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.720]   And you have the time and flexibility to do this.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.680]   And I think that's a great investment of the time you have.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.560]   I've done a good job of meeting friends and communities locally.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.960]   But I think the thing that I'm finding hardest kind of being solo is like professional peers
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.920]   and people that are working on similar problems and things like that.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.040]   So I've considered kind of like setting up like a mastermind call or something weekly.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.400]   It's the people that are working on similar things here.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.640]   I think that's really kind of the main thing that I'm concerned about is meeting other
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.200]   people that are, that also think this isn't as crazy and that are going through kind of
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.800]   similar professional challenges or things like that.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   I see what you're saying.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   I mean, I think that could be helpful.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   Writers have the same issue.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   It's a very lonely job.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.160]   You don't go to an office and it's weird.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.620]   Like most people aren't writers.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.760]   So it's hard to find.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   And I've done something similar.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.320]   I've been involved in various writers groups.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:25.040]   I mean, in my sense, the value where the value falls out of those is not the fact that we're
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.000]   getting together on zoom every other week.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.560]   It's the six months in this particular member of the group you kind of connect with.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.000]   And now there's someone you text with.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.520]   Now there's someone that like you see when they're in town.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.560]   So I see your question better now.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:44.080]   I would say it's worth it having the, you talked about the synchronous commitment, make
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   the commitment.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   I think that's fine.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   I think that's fine.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.080]   They're usually mixed.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.560]   These groups are okay, but it's like who you meet in the group could be, could be pretty
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   valuable.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   So I see what you're saying there.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.480]   But on the other hand, Hey, as a writer, I can say it is pretty lonely.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.640]   I mean, I know other writers, but it's a, it's a pretty, it could be a pretty lonely
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.280]   job and, and that's just part of it.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.640]   So you, you, you find connection, you know, outside.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.020]   I mean, look, I built this studio so I can come hang out with people because otherwise
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.000]   I'm just writing, writing by myself.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.060]   But also having my Georgetown position, I noticed a really big difference when the campus
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.320]   opened again, for example, post COVID like, Oh, just being able to come here, be around
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   people.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   So I think that is really valuable.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.320]   It's also just really hard.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   I just know a lot of writers who some of them meet other writer friends, but it's a weird
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   job.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.600]   Your situation might be similar.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.200]   So I think it's worth it to try those, those groups.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   It might help.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.720]   You might meet some people, but I think you need to be okay with the fact that you may
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.840]   not ever have the same experience as the other person, you know, who's in the 30 person venture
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.220]   backed startup and they're in the office 12 hours a day.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.200]   And it's, you know, here's the ping pong table and we're just getting after it.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.120]   You know, it is a little bit more lonely.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.320]   I think Paul Jarvis is great about that in that book because he moved to the middle of
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.440]   nowhere and he lives, I don't know, in the woods.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.680]   He lives in the woods in British Columbia somewhere.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.800]   But they, they love it, but it's like completely different.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.520]   I mean, they're, they are on their own up there doing their own thing.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.360]   And so you can be happy with that too.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.920]   So I basically am validating your pain here, Philip.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.200]   It is hard and you can probably, you might be able to do better, but I don't want to
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.520]   sugar coat it.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.140]   Like when you do a solo preneur type situation like this, I think a lot of your community
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.880]   connection comes outside of, outside of work.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.080]   How do you think about coaches?
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.800]   I think coaching is kind of having a moment right now and I've had some friends recommend
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.520]   hiring like a professional coach.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.560]   I think that also kind of factors into accountability that on some of the client projects, I feel
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.520]   like I can be working harder for someone else than I work for myself.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.400]   Do you think, like, how do you think about coaching?
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400]   I think you should try it.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   Do, do a six month engagement that like, this is what we're trying.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.880]   So it's more like you re-op, not that you would have to actually cancel it yourself
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.280]   to see if it's a good fit or not.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   I have a coach.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:06.560]   It is someone, she, she specializes in dealing with creatives who also are struggling with
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.840]   the issues of the business side of being a creative.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:14.340]   So I mean, it is a very narrow expertise that I need a lot of help on.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:21.400]   So she works with writers and filmmakers and screenwriters and directors and where businesses
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.600]   build up around their creative endeavors.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.440]   And I found that to be really useful.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.400]   So I would say I'm on board with coaching.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.420]   Not every coach is going to be a fit.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:36.660]   So try it out, but absolutely invest in that because you can get a huge return on that
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.420]   investment if it really changes the way you think about your business, the way you change,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.780]   you think about your life.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.540]   So yeah, you got my stamp of approval on that.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.100]   I think there should be more coaching in general.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.100]   And I think you're right.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.820]   It's having a moment where people are realizing I do a high end job.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.820]   There's a lot at stake.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:53.820]   It's complicated.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.140]   My, my, there's huge dividends to get in my life.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.700]   If I could make big changes, I don't quite know how to do that.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.940]   If there's someone who can help me through that, it could massively change the trajectory
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.940]   of my life.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.740]   I'll hire a trainer, I'll hire a doctor, I'll hire all these other things.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.480]   Why am I not hiring someone that's going to work on probably the most important thing
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.680]   I do, which is sort of figuring out exactly how my career unfolds.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.780]   So yeah, you got my approval on that one too.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.780]   Awesome.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   Thanks a lot.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:16.780]   Great.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.780]   Well, Philip, thanks for it.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:18.780]   Thanks for calling.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.500]   I think it's a good case study and a good constellation of related questions.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.100]   So definitely keep us posted on how things are going for you there in Chicago.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.100]   Will do.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.100]   Thanks, Kyle.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.100]   Thanks.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.340]   Thank you again, Philip, for calling into the show.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:34.300]   All right, Jessie, let's do some written questions submitted by our listeners.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.700]   Hey, by the way, just a reminder, listeners, we want your written questions.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.860]   You can go to the link that's right in the show description.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.900]   It takes you right to a survey where you can submit your questions for consideration on
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.900]   the show.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.660]   If you want to be a live caller, you can indicate it there.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.540]   We also have a link in the show description if you want to leave a voicemail.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.080]   So go check those out, submit your questions.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   We love them.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.080]   All right.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.140]   Let's get to the submitted question of this week's episode, Jessie.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.140]   Okay.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:09.060]   Question is from B. Have you found effective methods to sell the principles of deep work
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.220]   at an organizational level?
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   Now, B elaborated.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:19.460]   In addition to his question, he elaborated some details that he is at a company that
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:26.060]   is hardcore into the hyperactive hive mind mode of collaboration.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:32.320]   He elaborated that the department he runs, he wants to move them away from the hive mind
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.300]   and maybe even spark change throughout the whole company.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.760]   But he is concerned about being careful and political about how to do this.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:44.660]   So that if he like in a lot of big companies, if he just rushes in and says, you all bad
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.200]   Cal good slack, go bad or whatever, that's not going to go well.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   So he's he's trying to be strategic about how he helps move his organization away from
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   All right.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.740]   This is the issue I tackle in my book, A World Without Email.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:06.560]   My book, Deep Work pointed out the value of concentration in the knowledge where context
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.920]   a world without email is about.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.720]   How did we get to this point where that's so hard to do?
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.880]   And how do we go forward?
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.880]   How do we reform the structure of knowledge work to be more cognitive compatible?
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:23.480]   So drawing from that book, I'm going to give three steps.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.340]   To be three steps to carefully start moving your department, perhaps organization away
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.280]   from the hive mind.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   Step number one is to identify the proper enemy.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.520]   So in your discussions with other people about this issue, do not talk about it in terms
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.280]   of imposition or distraction.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.960]   Don't say, you know, people are doing too many meetings.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.120]   People are bad at email.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.480]   People are on slack too much.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.340]   People need to leave me alone.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.360]   It's a negative framing and it's too imprecise.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.240]   It rarely leads to actual change.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.560]   The proper enemy to focus on, in my opinion, is context switches.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.000]   They say, let's do some neuroscience here that neuroscientists have known about for
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   decades.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.400]   The human brain is slow to shift from one target of attention to another.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.380]   It is a complex process where lots of things happen in lots of different systems inside
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.120]   this gray matter between our ears.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:24.000]   So if you are rapidly shifting context, so jumping over to email, back to what you're
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.400]   writing, onto a short meeting, over to slack, back to what you're doing, it is a cognitive
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.280]   disaster.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.880]   You're initiating context shifts.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.200]   You are aborting the context shifts before they can complete, trying to go back to the
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:42.020]   original target of your concentration before that you can entirely return to that context.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.120]   You shift to something else like slack, then you rip it back.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:50.000]   This puts your mind in this permanent state of being in between context, which is a state
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.600]   in which it is very difficult to work at high capacity.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.920]   It is also a state that is exhausting.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.200]   It exhausts us as humans.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.560]   We're not meant to be doing this.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.420]   So we burn out, we get tired.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.520]   Long term, it makes us want to leave our careers.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.600]   Short term, it makes us literally dumber.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.400]   So now you have a very specific enemy.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.200]   How do we minimize context shifts so that we can get more value out of our brain?
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:19.880]   So if we want to borrow a sort of a Ginny O'Dell graduate seminar speak here, we are
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:25.240]   introducing a productivity discourse into this issue, which is probably the right discourse
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.920]   if we're working with managers, you're talking to the C-suite.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   Let's talk productivity.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.320]   We are getting a suboptimal return on investment in cognitive resources if we're having these
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.120]   minds have all these context shifts.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.500]   So the goal now becomes, and this is step two, which is to clarify the solutions.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.920]   The goal now becomes, how do we put in place systems for collaboration that gets the work
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.520]   done with less context shifts?
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   And we want to do this because the work will get done faster and better.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.720]   Oh, we have this nice side effect.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.440]   We won't burn everyone out and make everyone miserable.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.200]   That becomes the solution.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:04.840]   You feel the difference in this tone versus instead saying at the executive board meeting,
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.960]   I hate all these distractions.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960]   It's annoying.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.320]   You guys have too many meetings.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.640]   You're on email too much.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.640]   This is all bad.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.920]   That just comes across as accusatory and defensive, and it might all be true, but it rarely leads
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   to change.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   When you're instead coming in and saying, okay, we have this clear enemy and here's
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.600]   a clear solution.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.640]   Alternative systems of collaboration that will minimize context shift.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.720]   We can quantify this thing.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.160]   All you C-suite types are nerds anyway, so they like this type of talk.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.000]   Let's try to minimize context shifting, put in place collaboration systems that get the
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.660]   things done with less context shifting.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.800]   The work will get done faster.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.600]   It'll be at higher level of quality and you'll have much higher employee satisfaction and
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   engagement.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.960]   Now you're speaking the lingo.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.840]   Now you're speaking the corporate lingo.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:53.760]   All right, there's a few critical pieces here when trying to do this solution defining.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.720]   One, be very careful in your sales pitch.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:05.760]   A, that you have this very clear goal, context shift reduction, but two, to make sure that
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.160]   you're particularly pulling out convenience and speed as not particularly useful.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.580]   That if our end metric here, the thing we really care about, the end goal, is producing
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:21.400]   really good work at a good rate with high sustainability.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   Convenience doesn't matter.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.400]   Who cares?
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   Yeah, it's easy if you can email me.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   Who cares about convenience?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.800]   Good work systems are rarely convenient.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.040]   The definition of work is the application of force against the tendency towards rest.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.880]   It's supposed to be hard, so forget convenience.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.880]   Forget speed.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:37.400]   That by itself is not a value.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:41.880]   Quick responses, getting quick answers to things, that by itself is not valuable.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.680]   It is only valuable in so much that it actually helps an end point of high quality solutions
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.480]   at a good rate in a sustainable way.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.320]   So once you pointed out that actually reducing context switches will really boost that, you
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.060]   can isolate convenience and speed.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.640]   Convenience and speed are the handmaidens of the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.200]   It is the secondary end points that you're like, "Let's just pursue those," that leads
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.560]   you to a culture of we're always on Slack or always on email.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.700]   You can now isolate those.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.280]   You can segregate those and say, "This is not what we thought they would be.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.760]   Forget those."
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.960]   Context switching reduction is going to make us better, even if it's less convenient, even
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.680]   if certain things take slower in the moment.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.240]   So you have to at some point isolate convenience or speed or they will pull your whole system
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:23.160]   back to everyone's on Slack all the time.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.560]   Another critical step here for the sales bitch, Steam release valves.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.120]   I talked about this in a world without email.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.800]   Any system you devise, "Okay, here's how we're now going to do this type of work," and however
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.600]   you do it, there's office hours plus some sort of shared document, plus we use some
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.880]   sort of three-day protocol where we know what goes where, however you do it.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.840]   And we've talked about this a million times in the show, so I won't go into too many details
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.720]   about what these systems look like.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:52.760]   But whatever systems you start coming up with, make sure they have Steam release valves.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:58.240]   That is a break glass in case of emergency way to get in touch with someone if the system's
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.680]   not working.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:07.160]   This is a key piece of psychology for buy-in because what, more than anything else, once
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.360]   everyone's bought in on the context switching reduction goal, more than anything else, what
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.800]   will stop you is catastrophizing.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.200]   So the CIO is like, "Look, I get what you're saying.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.160]   I'm on board about the context shifting.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.000]   I'm on board about convenience and speed being overrated.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.520]   But what if we get in a situation where this is urgent and we can't get back to the client
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   and we lose the client?"
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:34.080]   Catastrophizing is a big obstacle once you get to the stage of actually constructing
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.200]   these systems.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.800]   Steam release valves is my term for these break glass in case of emergency alternatives
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.000]   if something like that happens.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.800]   All you have to do is have a backup communication method that induces some friction.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   Call me.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.360]   We all agree that you can call the person on this number, which will never be blocked
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.200]   if there's some really time-sensitive emergency.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.000]   This gives people the psychological cover necessary to avoid catastrophization.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.160]   All right, if the client comes back and needs something right away, I can always just call
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160]   you.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.360]   We're not going to lose the client.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.960]   And the thing is, as long as there's a little bit of friction in these release valve strategies,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.760]   no one ever uses them.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   No one's ever going to actually call you or they'll call you.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.220]   It'll happen once.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:20.280]   It's more about giving people that relief of if there's an emergency, we can step out
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   of this system.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   We'll be okay.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.640]   If there's not enough friction, this doesn't work.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.280]   If you say, well, if there's a real emergency, just hit me up on Slack.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.740]   There's too little friction there.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.160]   So everyone will just fall back to Slack.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.600]   But if I have to pick up a phone and call you and talk to you in real time, I was like,
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.760]   I'll just follow the system.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.200]   All right.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:44.160]   Step three, create a bottom-up culture of ongoing experimentation and participation.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.640]   So it's not about just going through and saying, here's our five new collaboration systems
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.800]   that reduce context shifting.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.580]   Many fewer emails we have to answer, many few Slack.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.320]   You have to A, have it be participatory.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.760]   I didn't say that right.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   Participatory.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.200]   There we go.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.120]   Everyone who's involved in this new system has to have a say in constructing it.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.560]   It won't work if you come in and say, Hey, everyone, here's the new system for collaboration
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.000]   because I read Cal's book and here's how we're going to get rid of context shifts.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.400]   Immediately people's hackles will go up.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.640]   I don't like this.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.480]   I don't know about this.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.200]   This is, you know, this is like typical, whatever B was the guy's name.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.840]   This looks like typical B type behavior, but if it's instead, here's Cal's work.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.080]   We're worried about context shifting.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.600]   We'll think blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   Everyone's on board.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.160]   Hey, let's all work together.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160]   What do you think we should do?
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.200]   Everyone's on board if they're involved with it.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.040]   And then ongoing means you have to assume 40% of whatever you do is not going to work.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.960]   So it's like every week for a while, we're going to go back.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Let's go through things.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   What's not working.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   What do we want to throw out?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   What do we want to tweak?
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.400]   It's an ongoing culture because you're not going to get it right the first time.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.200]   So people need to be involved and you need an ongoing culture of cutting off the dead
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.560]   wood.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.280]   If this was right for this quarter, but not right for this quarter, get rid of it.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.900]   If this never worked, change it.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.200]   If this is going well, celebrate it.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.680]   So there has to be an ongoing culture as well.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.800]   So B I'll just step back and say, here's the thing.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.440]   Everything I just described to you adds up to a pretty complicated play.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:21.920]   In some sense, this is the biggest explanation I have for why the hyperactive hive mind continues
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.800]   to dominate, even if alternatives would be more profitable.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.960]   And it is because of complexity.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.000]   Those three steps I gave you are not easy.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.720]   It requires a lot of buying from a lot of people and a lot of energy engaged.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.280]   This is why I think we're still stuck in the hive mind.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.600]   And this is often the case.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.560]   I think when we have revolutions in business practices throughout different industries
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.720]   over history, especially technologically driven revolutions, it just takes a long time because
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   it's hard.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.120]   And it's the example I give in the book about Henry Ford and the continuous motion assembly
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.880]   line.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.920]   Once he figured out how that worked, it was clearly more productive than the old ways
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.380]   of building car.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.200]   But the technology was in place for these assembly lines for years and years and years
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.520]   before he figured it out.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520]   And why?
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520]   Because it was hard.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.680]   It was hard to get all the details right.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.280]   It was hard to get all those things to work.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.480]   They had to invent new tools and systems and hire people and spend money and it made things
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   worse for a while.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.560]   So essentially knowledge work needs its own kind of Henry Ford moment.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.080]   Someone persisting through the hardness to figure out these better ways.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.520]   And then once the rest of the industry sees, hey, that guy is producing digital cars 10
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.440]   X faster than us.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.080]   That's when you start to get the fast spread.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.400]   All right, Jesse.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.600]   I haven't been able to do my world without email sermon in a while.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   Sounds good.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   So that's nice.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.160]   I got to preach sometimes about hyperactive hive mind.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   All right, what do we got next?
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.960]   Next question is from Charles, a 58 year old software developer.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   I'm 58 years old software developer, developer who just quit his job in June.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.680]   I spent the summer with my school age kids during their summer vacation.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   I figured it was important to do this while they still like me.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.040]   Now that they're back in school, I want to take time to do a deep reset on my life.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.440]   What are your thoughts and how should I proceed with this?
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.800]   Well first of all, I'll note that as part of Charles's elaboration, he mentioned that
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:27.040]   he had previously in his life already gone through a lifestyle centric career planning
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:32.260]   process that actually explains his current situation.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:36.920]   So he works remotely living in a small country town in Oregon, which he said was a big goal
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   of his early.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.640]   He wanted to live in the country, have a country lifestyle, work remotely.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.240]   So he had already gone through some lifestyle centric design.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.720]   He quit his job in part because he's tired of it.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.300]   The particular job he found that allowed him to live in the country was a remote job that
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.320]   had time zone issues.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.680]   So it actually, this company worked with developers in India.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.240]   There's a lot of him having to be up at 5 a.m. to manage time zone differences, to check
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.240]   in with these teams.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.840]   He also had a hyperactive hive mind culture that was getting to him.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.400]   So it makes sense why he left.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   He's a little bit late.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400]   He's later in his career.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.160]   He's getting closer to something like retirement or pseudo retirement is on the table.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.560]   And so he's looking to make a change.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.160]   So I thought this was a good example of lifestyle centric career planning in what we can think
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.120]   of as like Q3 of your life.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.760]   It's a little bit later in life.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.720]   So Charles, a couple pieces of advice I'd have for someone in your situation at your
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.280]   age is let's think location.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:40.120]   So as you think about this, this Q3 of your life where you're heading towards retirement,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.760]   do you still like living in the country in Oregon?
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.240]   Do you want to do something different?
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.440]   Do you want a part time in the city, part time in the country, depending on the season?
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.680]   Now's the time to figure out what the new configuration is.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.800]   Your kids leave and go to school.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.280]   What's the new configuration that you think is going to be optimal?
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.880]   Two, look through your buckets, your deep life buckets and ask the question, what has
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.280]   been neglected in recent years?
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.720]   Are the things that are important to you that you've neglected as you've gone through maybe
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.120]   this more career centric focused part of your life?
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.520]   Like for example, is health and fitness neglected?
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.720]   Are you thinking this would be a great time, especially as they get older, to get an excellent
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.920]   shape like I'm going to give that a lot of attention or becoming a leader in your community?
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.360]   Have you been disconnected from the various communities you're involved in and now you
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360]   want to do that more?
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.680]   It's a good time to go through those buckets and say what's been neglected.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.600]   And finally, it's a good time to think through what's sometimes called third act missions.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.640]   So in this part of your life, as you've gone through the first act of getting started in
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.840]   the world of work, you've gone through the second act of becoming established and establishing
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.480]   who you are in the world of work.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.600]   You've done that now you're almost 60.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.440]   With your third act, do you have a clear mission?
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.800]   And it could be professional or non-professional, but something that you really want to focus
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.760]   your energy on and matters.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.440]   Those are the type of questions I would be going through right now as part of doing lifestyle
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.720]   centric career planning from scratch.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.000]   Once you have a new lifestyle for this, whatever Q3 of your life, whatever you want to call
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   it.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.160]   Once you have this new lifestyle fixed down, you have a lot of options.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.480]   You're a successful software developer.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.720]   You left your job at that existing firm.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.400]   There is a lot of opportunities for you at a lot of different levels of income versus
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.400]   autonomy trade-offs.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.080]   There's a big demand for software developers.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.800]   You could be freelancing, you could be contracting, you could take a job at a company that's fully
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.400]   remote and has more results oriented so that you can have a lot more flexibility.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.560]   You can build your own product.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.160]   You have a lot of different options here.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.660]   So this is great.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:47.800]   Work backwards from your answers to these questions and say, as I reenter the working
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.480]   world, what do I need to support my answers?
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.680]   And seek out employment working backwards from what you've resolved there.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.000]   I think this is a really important part of your life where you've had a career, you've
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.920]   done well, you've made money, you have succeeded.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.960]   So it really is, if there's any stage in your career to start seeing your work as functional.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.160]   It is a utilitarian means to an end and the ends are what I'm really thinking about now.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.360]   This is the time to do that.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:23.800]   So get those answers really clear, focus on those three things and get incredibly strategic
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.220]   with your work situation.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.280]   What do I need to support those while minimizing the negative side effects of whatever I'm
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   doing for work?
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.440]   It sounds like that's where you are in your particular life.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   I also like, by the way, I just want to make the note, that spending the whole summer just
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.360]   with your kids.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.520]   That I think is a big issue.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.440]   I've been talking about this more.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:55.080]   I think as my kids get older, so they've left that little kid toddler age, which is just
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.240]   all hands on deck kind of survival mode.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.600]   And now they're becoming elementary school age kids.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.640]   I have certainly noticed this and I have all boys, so there might be a sort of dad boys
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   things here.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.080]   They need as much time as possible with me.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.680]   I feel that dynamic now.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.040]   I talked about this in our interview with Yale.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.480]   I feel that dynamic now much more than I did before.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.640]   And it's actually been one of the sparks of my development of the slow productivity philosophy,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:30.120]   because now the question becomes, how can you service ambition to create things of value
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.100]   and interest and legacy in the world without having to give it most of your time?
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.640]   How can you find some sort of middle ground where you can, for example, in my case, spend
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.280]   as much time as possible with my kids while still producing things I'm proud of?
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.700]   How can you be okay with maybe the rate of that production is lower?
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.800]   But when you zoom out to 15 years from now, after all my kids are in college, I look back
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.280]   and I can say, look at these things I did.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.880]   I wrote these books and these articles.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.440]   There's four things in here I'm really proud about.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.240]   I don't care that maybe there could have been seven instead of four.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.540]   The thing is I did things I'm proud about.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.880]   How do you navigate those dynamics?
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.040]   That's a big, big question that I'm trying to answer with slow productivity.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.960]   So Charles, I really empathize with what you're saying there.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.240]   And it's something I'm working on as well.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.160]   So everyone should stay tuned to hear my thoughts on that.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.920]   All right.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.160]   We got time for a few more.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.560]   What do we have next year, Jesse?
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   All right.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.400]   Next question is from Gabe, 28 year old in Virginia.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.960]   I currently have a dream job.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.760]   It's deep work paradise with an excellent work life balance.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.920]   My problem is that I'm not used to having this level of autonomy.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.600]   As a result, I find myself filling my time with nonsense just to feel busy.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.480]   I jump into meetings, reread emails, sometimes put on a video game or Netflix show or another
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.360]   screen to fill the void.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.280]   How do I embrace this deeper environment?
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.560]   I'm guessing that Gabe does not work at Twitter.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.760]   Just based off of what I discovered when I looked for 30 minutes into the news about
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.240]   Twitter, it looks like that's not the environment right now over at Twitter.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:14.440]   Another piece of background on this particular question is Gabe elaborated that he's been
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.480]   active service military for 10 years and this is his first job after that.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.040]   So he's used to from his military positions, a much more reactive, hyperactive hive mind
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.440]   style workflow where there's just constantly stuff being given to you or you're constantly
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.680]   reacting to things.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.680]   So in particular, going from that to a fully autonomous, it's a tech industry job, he's
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.360]   having a hard time with that transition.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.560]   So Gabe, I'll start by saying, yeah, it's a good problem to have and the core of your
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.640]   solution is going to be multi-scale planning.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.120]   If you're just haphazard in a highly autonomous workplace, it can be a disaster.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.280]   People think, oh, this is the dream to have a job where I have a lot of free time and
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.320]   I can kind of control what I work on.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.720]   It's not a dream.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.120]   For most people, this is very difficult.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.360]   Gabe goes on to talk about how anxious this is making him.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:09.160]   We don't like having time that we don't know what to do with, where we're in that weird
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.320]   liminal space between complete relaxation and productivity and we're sort of working,
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   we're sort of not.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   I mean, that is soul crushing.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.240]   And that is soul crushing.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.160]   The solution is multi-scale planning.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.480]   That's going to be the foundation of the solution.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.440]   So with multi-scale planning, Gabe, and you can get more details of this, go look at my
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.520]   time management video at my YouTube page or many other places I've talked about this.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.760]   With multi-scale planning, you start at multiple temporal scales to get control and get intentional
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   about your time.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.200]   So you have a quarterly or semester plan that's laying out bigger vision.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.400]   You look at that every week when you build a weekly plan.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.780]   What am I doing with my week?
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.760]   This is where you can make changes to your schedule to optimize better what's available.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.920]   You look at your weekly plan every day where you build a daily time block plan.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.920]   You're giving every minute of your day a job.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.720]   You're not just looking up and saying, what do I want to do next?
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.480]   Learn that habit and you're going to feel much more in control of your time.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480]   All right.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.040]   So now you have just the mechanics of multi-scale planning in place.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.960]   The extent of the free time you have is going to be clear and this free time is going to
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   be consolidated.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.480]   If you're doing multi-scale planning, when you get to a day, you're looking at your weekly
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.440]   plan, you're confident about what you're trying to work on this week and therefore what needs
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.620]   to be done today.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.520]   You time block the time exactly when you're going to do the various things this day.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.680]   All of that's really clear.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.400]   The time that remains is clearly left over.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.640]   So you've clarified and consolidated the free time you have.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.680]   And it sounds like right now that's a lot.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   Good.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   First step.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.760]   Let's just get our arms around it.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   Here it is.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.200]   Three hours today, one hour this day.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.160]   I had nothing to do on Thursday.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.000]   You've isolated it and clarified it.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.640]   Now that you've captured this elusive substance free time, you can be concrete about what
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.600]   you want to do with it.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.280]   And you have options here.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.120]   We've talked about a lot of these on the show before.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.920]   Number one is the phantom part-time job.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.800]   So maybe you are accomplishing what your employer wants you to do and you're doing it well.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.000]   And with confidence, you know that you're giving it enough time and you can shut down
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.080]   that work with clarity.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   Great.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.600]   Maybe you're working on a side hustle with the time that remains.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.960]   We call these phantom part-time jobs because you don't talk about this publicly.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.240]   We talked about what last week show, Jesse, this over-employment movement.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.800]   And I felt like that was going too far, but that was this movement where you have like
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.760]   an actual another job.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.280]   But phantom part-time jobs is more side hustling.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.560]   You know, I'm building out something on the side, but you're doing it with complete control
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.040]   of your time.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.920]   It's a bit of an ethical gray area, but I do think there's some integrity in phantom
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.720]   part-time jobs if you really are an expert multiscale planner, because you are being
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.240]   very clear about how you're using your time.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.680]   You're accomplishing the goals your employer has given you.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.000]   The time is very clearly segregated from your work time.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.600]   As long as you're getting the things done and your employer is happy.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.600]   I think it's okay.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   All right.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.600]   That's one option.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.080]   Option two, rapid career capital acquisition.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   Great.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.780]   I have this free time.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:09.040]   Let me do some careful self-research on my industry to figure out what skills are valuable,
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.480]   what skills aren't, what would really help me write my own ticket.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.520]   I'm now going to systematically dedicate this free time, this clear on everyday time
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.040]   clock schedule towards the rapid acquisition of these skills.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.600]   I'm then going to take these skills out for a spin, shift my career in directions that
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.240]   resonate and away from things that don't.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.280]   That would be the method I would talk about in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.280]   Great.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.840]   I am in five years going to have so much career capital that, like the listener from before,
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.240]   his question, I can live in the small town in Oregon and trail run all day and only work
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.520]   three hours a day and make a good living.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.720]   That's another good option.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.080]   Another rapid advancement.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.800]   The third option, of course, is nonprofessional structured pursuit.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.800]   I will use this time to pursue something true to my values that servicing one of my nonprofessional
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.440]   buckets in my deep life schema that's very important to me.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.480]   I'm in a lucky stage of my life where I have this free time.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.800]   I'm in control of my time.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   I'm on top of things.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   My employer is happy.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.160]   I'm going to whatever.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:16.320]   And maybe it's, you know, like Cam Haines, who has a full-time job working for the state
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.680]   of Washington, Oregon, I forgot which, but, you know, became this high endurance, super
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.440]   endurance, super athlete, bow hunter, which he documented and has become like a source
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.520]   of inspiration for a lot of people.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.280]   So maybe it's some sort of, you know, over the top fitness pursuit that gives meaning
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.800]   to your post-military life and could be a source of inspiration for others and structures
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.080]   your life and injects all this discipline.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.640]   Maybe it's a community investment.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.400]   You know, this small church in my town that I belong to is struggling and I'm going to,
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.960]   you know, step up and really help turn this around.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   Or I'm going to start up a community service program.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:56.720]   You know, maybe it's a creative pursuit that is not for profit, but just you're trying
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.880]   to be a part of this community.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.160]   There's a lot of things here.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.920]   Maybe you buy land and you're renovating the land, you're refreshing it, and you're going
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.120]   to eventually retire from your job and it's going to be a retreat center.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.020]   I don't know.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.240]   But you could have a very structured pursuit that's not directly related to making money
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.240]   or your job.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.600]   What I'm saying here is multiscale planning is what gives you the clarity required to
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.480]   make the most of the resources you have.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.200]   And if you're in a lucky position to have a lot of leftover time, don't squander it.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.800]   This type of structure is what's going to allow you to actually take advantage of that
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   time.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.820]   We tell ourself the story, all I want is free time and no thoughts about it, completely
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.940]   unstructured free time.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.280]   But that's not true.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.680]   We want like three hours of that a week.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.560]   And then we get unhappy.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.200]   We want autonomy.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.680]   We want control over what we're doing.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.000]   We want to aim our actions towards things that are meaningful.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.460]   We want a variety in our activities.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:53.240]   We want to get to those key human nutriments like mastery and connection, et cetera.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.400]   But we don't necessarily just want nothing to do and no plans.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.040]   So multiscale plan, Gabe, and then lean into being very clear about what do I do with the
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040]   time that remains.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:07.960]   All right, why don't we do, we've done an old fashioned call in a while, Jesse.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   Yeah, we got a call from Raquel.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   So we'll take a listen.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.680]   Hello, Cal and Jesse.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.880]   My name is Raquel.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.920]   I create online courses for a company.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.520]   My productivity problem is the number of added bags to carry with me.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:30.080]   The time block planner, a moleskin notebook reserved for meetings, which I rarely use,
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.120]   a loose leaf notepad that I make out of half sheets of recycled paper attached by one metal
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.320]   book ring in the corner, which I use to dump everything in my mind as I work or create
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.560]   checklists as I'm working on a project.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:51.040]   I also find myself implementing a working memory.txt file on my computer based on your
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   recommendations.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:59.000]   But then on Sundays, I switch completely to my Franklin Coffee Planner.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.120]   When I go to work in the office or when I go to a doctor's appointment and I need to
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.320]   wait, I want to take one planning item with me to do some planning, either weekly planning
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.920]   or a new routine I want to try or habits and initiatives I want to incorporate.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.040]   But I find myself in a dilemma as to which item to bring.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.160]   I wish I could stick to one item, but I think my personality prevents me from staying at
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.480]   peace with one system.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480]   Any advice?
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.160]   Raquel, good question.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.280]   I think the answer here is to have one of those old school media carts like we used
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.520]   to have in grammar school with the TV on it and everything, multiple layers.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.800]   I just drag this thing with me.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.360]   You can have monitors, you can have multiple notebooks, you can have an easel that you
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.360]   can put out and write with with a sharpie.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.520]   Now, OK, what too many artifacts, what to bring when you are on the road?
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.520]   It's a good question.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:02.440]   I think the right thing to do here is to separate capture from long term systems.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.360]   So let's get that right first.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.840]   Have your long term systems, for most people, these will be digital, for long term tasks,
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:19.720]   task storage, long term note keeping, ideas, etc., thoughts about whatever changes you
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   want to make in your life.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.640]   You have these permanent systems that you use.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.820]   You have your calendar for appointments, you have your weekly plan for what you're doing
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.120]   this week, you have your time block plan for today, you have your task management system
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.680]   for keeping task, you have your note taking system for ideas and other types of long form
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   capture.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.160]   Preferably, you know, there's ways you check in on each of these.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.680]   So with multi scale planning, that's just built into the system.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.920]   But you know, I like to do roughly monthly check in on my my broader catch all note taking
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.760]   systems just to see, hey, am I missing ideas, etc.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760]   That's all permanent.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.720]   None of that has to be particularly portable.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:58.400]   None of that has to have particularly efficient interfaces for entering information to it.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.880]   Things like that from capture.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880]   Doctor's office and meeting.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.120]   Let's use those as our two case studies here.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.360]   I'm at the doctor's office.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   I'm in a meeting.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360]   I'm attending in person.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.200]   Like, what do I bring with me?
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.200]   You could bring a laptop and try to interface into all of these systems on the fly.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.200]   Not going to work.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   You're not going to have the laptop at the doctor's office.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.080]   It's too hard to think through and interface with your systems on the fly anyways, because
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.780]   often you have a half formed thought in the moment that you have to actually later give
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.880]   some attention to to even figure out what does this mean?
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.880]   Where does it go?
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.780]   How do I word this?
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:38.540]   So we need some sort of capture intermediary to capture this information for it to later
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.640]   be integrated into the background systems.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.360]   And there I'm going to say just have a digital and a paper working memory dot txt.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.400]   If you're in the media and you have your laptop open, always have working memory dot txt right
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.840]   there on your desktop.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.560]   Have it be a plain text file.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.480]   On my Mac, I use text to edit for this and I have it set to plain text.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.760]   So there's no fonts, there's no formatting, there's no bolding.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.400]   It's just all plain text, as simple and fast as possible.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.960]   So if you're in the meeting and there's ideas that come up, appointments you have to add
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   to your calendar, tasks that need to go on your task list, things you're confused about
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.240]   that you just need to think, like, what does this even mean?
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.280]   You're writing that at the speed of typing into working memory dot txt.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:24.400]   When you're at the doctor's office, you have a good high quality spiral bound notebook
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.840]   and you can capture right in there.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:34.280]   If you're bringing a time block planner with you that has no capture spaces for this information
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   as well.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.120]   And then you just need the discipline that by the time I get to the shutdown, as part
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.080]   of my shutdown routine, I look at these two captures.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.380]   Obviously my working memory dot txt on my computer, I process it before I shut down
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.520]   for the day.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   What's going on here?
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.560]   Where does this go?
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.380]   And you that finds a home.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:53.600]   You just have the notebook right next to you when you do this and you take the same stuff
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.980]   out of your notebook, the things you jotted down and it goes into a permanent system.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.400]   So I think that differentiation helps, helps people.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.800]   Permanent systems can be big and clunky, but you trust them.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.720]   On the go capture should just be simple.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.600]   One digital, one paper.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.760]   There are systems that try to put all of these in the one artifact.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.620]   I think bullet journaling is a good example.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:18.620]   Now that's fine.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:22.400]   If your life has a level of complexity that enables that.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.200]   I just think for a lot of knowledge workers, that doesn't work.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.280]   There's just too many things coming at them.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.480]   Too many hundreds of ongoing tasks, rapidly moving calendars, seven or eight different
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.560]   roles that you have different objectives for.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.980]   Typically you need the power of digital systems.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.960]   You can't have all that captured in one notebook.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:43.120]   So I just separate the two and I just allow there to be glorious inefficiency and clunkiness
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.580]   in my permit systems, but incredible low friction efficiency in the mobile systems I take with
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   me.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.580]   All right.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:56.400]   Let's, let's do, let's do one more question here before we get to our three interesting
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   things segment.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   All right.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   Sounds good.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.440]   Question from Italia.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.640]   You've mentioned that one way to answer the question, what makes a good life good is to
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.200]   turn to biographies of people whose life you admire.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.480]   Who do you personally admire?
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.760]   Well, I have a lot of answers to that question, but why don't I just give you one example
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:20.200]   of someone I admire and that admiration has been developed and nuanced through the reading
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.600]   of biographies.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.400]   And one of my classic examples there is Abraham Lincoln, real influence on me.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.920]   I'm actually reading John Meacham's new biography of Lincoln and there was light.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   So I'm about halfway through that.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   I'm enjoying that one.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.720]   I've read a lot of Lincoln books, but that one is ranking pretty high up so far.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.040]   So I like what he's doing there.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.040]   All right.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:48.400]   So here's the, the two things I, I learned about Lincoln through going deep through biographical
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.800]   material that makes him someone I admire.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.280]   One is the fact that Lincoln was a, a moral being.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.240]   I want to be really clear about what I mean by that.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:07.440]   I don't mean that in the sense that he was a superlative example of morality that, you
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.720]   know, even by 21st century standards, we look back at everything he does did or think and
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.200]   said, wow, he had found some sort of crystalline, pure morality.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.160]   He had, you know, broken free from any sort of parochial or cultural influences and just
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.080]   saw the, the, the abstract platonic light of the perfect moral sentiments.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:32.360]   It's not that his morality was at a very high polished plane, but that he saw his morality
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.120]   as an important part of his life.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.200]   And he worked on it explicitly throughout his life.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.240]   He is a moral being.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.720]   What you get out of reading his biographies is the degree to which he thought that maintaining
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:49.560]   and evolving his sense of principles and living his life by them was a key project of a life
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.800]   well lived.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:58.440]   A good book that really looks at this is William Lee Miller's Lincoln's Virtues.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.300]   Miller it's a, it's a moral biography or an ethical biography, I think he calls it of
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]   Lincoln.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:09.060]   And it goes through just the development of, of how Lincoln repeatedly would interrogate
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:14.100]   his own underlying principles and evolve them and grow them and nuance them.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.740]   And then let that then speak back to what he was doing in his life and in his political
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.860]   career.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.340]   That's what I think was important.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.260]   He thought that was, he thought that was key.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:29.420]   I am more impressed by someone who throughout their life really cares about struggles with
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:34.940]   and tries to evolve and live by a evolving empathetic moral code than I am by someone
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:40.420]   who maybe has in isolation, the better moral beliefs, but came by it easy.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:42.580]   That they were born at a time where it was just really obvious.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.780]   And in fact, if you had a different belief, someone would yell at you anyways.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.980]   There's no strain there.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.700]   It's the life interrogated.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.700]   That's really rare.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.700]   He really did that.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:54.700]   All right.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:58.780]   Number two, the other thing I've learned about Lincoln, why I admire him, is the fact that
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.060]   he has a purposive intelligence.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:02.060]   P-U-R-P-O-S-I-V-E.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:09.020]   I think it was actually William Lee Miller who used that term in talking about Lincoln.
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:14.100]   What that means by purposive intelligence was he had a brain that worked and he put
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:19.620]   this brain to work to try to impact the world in positive ways.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:27.980]   He saw his brain as an asset and systematically developed this asset to try to get a return
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:32.540]   out of it, in particular return in terms of making a positive impact on the world.
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:41.660]   It really is an amazing story how this kid growing up in the depths of early 19th century
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:48.740]   American poverty, just on the strength of his brain alone, emerged out of this context,
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:55.300]   backwater Kentucky, barely literate father, dead mother, single father, barely literate,
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:28:02.060]   who had him just doing the harshest of manual labors, suspicious of book learning, renting
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:07.540]   him out to other people for just be labor for these other people.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.860]   You don't get to keep the money.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.860]   Lincoln hated that.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:13.620]   He emerged from that just off of the strength of his brain, which he developed.
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.420]   And he knew there was something there and he developed that and applied it.
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:23.260]   All of his impact comes from the very careful cultivation of this intelligence.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.500]   You look at his debates with Stephen Douglas, it's a masterclass in just working through
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.300]   clarity and thinking.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.620]   Look at his Cooper Union address as he's building up to his potential nomination for the president
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:38.820]   of 1860.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:44.140]   You see here again, a masterclass in weeks, if not months of research into the history
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:48.260]   of the country, building step-by-step, these incredibly logical arguments.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:53.000]   You have to understand how unique this was in its time.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.820]   The great renauticians of the 19th century were pompous and it was emotional.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:05.980]   It was a lot of classical illusions, a lot of Cicero being quoted and a lot of personal
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.160]   vindictive or emotional appeals.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.100]   It was a lot of trying to get people fired up by appealing and inflaming their passions.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.300]   And there's a lot of ad hominem going on and then trying to establish your intelligence
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.700]   to look at all these different books I can cite.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.620]   Stephen came in and said, I'm going to be logical and incredibly plain spoken.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:32.180]   I'm going to step-by-step like the lawyer he was, bring you through why the Nebraska
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:39.480]   Act is actually against the founder's intentions, why this would be devastating to the country.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:46.860]   Taking down his anti-slavery arguments were not like you would get more from maybe the
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:52.700]   William Lloyd Garrison, not barn burners, but we're going to go A to B to C to E.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.740]   And when we get to F, it's clear that this makes no sense.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.180]   That was an incredibly effective rhetorical strategy.
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:02.460]   It's all based off of purposive intelligence and it made a massive difference.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:08.740]   It was why he got nominated for the Republican ticket, was because he had built this reputation
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.700]   of he's not out there inflaming people.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:15.500]   He's not out there in the 1860 equivalent of Twitter trying to score points for his
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.500]   team.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:20.380]   He's got a real reasonableness and logic.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:25.380]   And there's a moderatism that actually that's what worked.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380]   That's what worked.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.460]   That's what led to the 13th amendment.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:34.060]   So to me, that was a big inspiration, the way that he cultivated an intelligence to
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.180]   affect change, very systematic.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:41.460]   A good book for that, so I'm kind of giving book recommendations around the way.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.820]   John Stoffer from Harvard, his book Giants.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.980]   What it does, and it's interesting, is he takes Frederick Douglass and Lincoln.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.740]   Here's two people who are coming out of impossible situations.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:59.060]   Douglass' situation, of course, even more impossible being in a Eastern Shore slave
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   on the Eastern Shore.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:06.360]   Lincoln, of course, was not a slave, but they were both coming out of these impossible circumstances.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:12.200]   And they both, this is what Stoffer really characterizes, is through the development
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:17.220]   of their mind, how they were able to become in the end giants and their lives became very
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.220]   intertwined.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:21.380]   So that's sort of Giants sort of gets into the intertwining of the lives of Frederick
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.940]   Douglass and Lincoln.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:29.220]   So they kind of have these parallel emergences all about taking these minds, cultivating
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:33.220]   them and then putting them systematically towards what they thought was important uses.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.580]   And then their lives ended up becoming quite intertwined.
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.660]   They were at some point, you know, at some point they were almost adversarial.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:47.060]   So you get Douglass' famous speech on what the Fourth of July means to a former slave,
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:51.980]   but they come later in life that Douglass is an incredible supporter, actually, of Lincoln's
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.780]   very systematic approach and his very functionalist approach.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:01.460]   And, you know, let's try to actually make change happen as opposed to making the people
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.860]   on our side as happy as possible.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:05.860]   And there's a whole interesting story there.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.860]   One more book recommendation then, if you like that particular that particular line
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:11.860]   of thinking H.W.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:18.220]   Brand's Zealot, which contrasts John Brown and Lincoln and their approach to anti-slavery
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.220]   movements.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.700]   Brown's was very zealous and very pure.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:28.540]   And we get a lot of likes on the Twitter, but he ended up not only hung, but actually
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:31.020]   perhaps even causing issues with the movement.
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:35.500]   Lincoln would not be popular on Twitter, but did get the 13th amendment.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.620]   So anyways, that's an example.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:43.300]   Natalia, Lincoln is someone who I grew to admire through reading as much as possible
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.740]   on him and picking out these very specific things, which I think have a general application
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:49.580]   are generally relevant to a lot of us.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:54.300]   Justin, I actually met someone at the live event.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.300]   Mike.
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.300]   Mike.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.620]   Mike gave me a recommendation.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.300]   I got to read this book.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.300]   It's about this.
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.660]   This sounds so me.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:10.700]   It's Lincoln, Civil War, and the role of technology in the Civil War and like how the telegraph
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.300]   and the and the railroads and you know, it was actually these really advanced technological
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.860]   systems were so intertwined in Lincoln's managing of the war.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860]   I mean, that's.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.460]   That's kind of hitting all my buttons, probably.
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:25.540]   How many Lincoln books do you think you've consumed like 30?
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.220]   Probably not 30 a dozen, I would say.
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.060]   Have you always been a fan?
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.380]   I came to him through books.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.900]   I came to him through.
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:40.900]   My mother-in-law bought me Lincoln's Virtues and then Miller wrote another book about Lincoln's
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:41.900]   time in the White House.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:42.900]   I read those.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.980]   This would have been grad school and that kind of set me down.
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.340]   And then John Stauffer, we knew.
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:53.460]   So John Stauffer, when I was at MIT, my wife worked at a nonprofit in Watertown with John's
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.860]   wife and they did not.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:59.660]   It was an education nonprofit, history, education, nonprofits like John.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.860]   He was always involved and would do events.
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:08.140]   And so I remember like John Stauffer and Skip Gates from Harvard were always sort of around.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.700]   And so I remember his, you know, his book signing party for that book.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:16.260]   So we knew John just knew him from our time in Cambridge, babysat his kids before.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.060]   So then that book also was exposed to around that same time.
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.060]   It's a great book.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:24.060]   All right.
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.340]   I want to get to this new segment.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.340]   Three interesting things.
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.380]   First, let me briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:35.000]   That's our friends at 8 Sleep.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.800]   As you now know, if you've been listening to this podcast recently, I am an 8 Sleep
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.800]   addict, addict, addict.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800]   What am I saying?
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800]   Addict or addict?
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.700]   Why can't I say this word, Jesse?
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.700]   You say it.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.060]   Addict like in your basement.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.340]   I live in an attic with an 8 Sleep machine.
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.340]   Addict.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.340]   See, it's hard.
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.660]   It doesn't sound right to my ear.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.740]   It all sounds like the word addict, T T I C instead of A D D I C T.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Addict, addict.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.060]   I'm an 8 Sleep addict.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:11.500]   Well, anyways, the 8 Sleep pod is a cover you put on top of your mattress and then you
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.380]   hook it up to this 8 Sleep machine that allows you to control the temperature of what you're
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.380]   sleeping on.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:20.060]   It has all these little capillaries and it runs water through it and back to this machine
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:25.740]   that takes heat out or adds heat in and you control it from an app and you can set the
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:30.060]   exact temperature you want the surface of your bed on both sides.
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:33.940]   I am completely hooked on this because here's what it does.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.980]   It can take the heat away when you sleep.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:41.180]   So you can have the blankets on, you can have the comforter on, on that winter night and
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:45.180]   not have to wake up two hours later and be completely overheated as all this body heat
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.180]   builds up.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.420]   It can just, you set it just right.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.780]   It just whisks away enough of that heat that you're always comfortable.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780]   You're not too hot.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:51.780]   You're not too cold.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:57.940]   I now have trouble sleeping on other beds because I have become so used to the 8 Sleep.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:02.460]   So I'm giving you my full personal anecdote here, my full personal endorsement.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.500]   I'm a hot sleeper.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.340]   This thing really works.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:12.860]   It allows you to cool as low as 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:14.980]   If you're an 8 Sleep user that you'll see they use numbers.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.140]   I'm a negative one.
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.780]   I'm negative one on that scale is my sweet spot.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:21.100]   They have surveys about how it helps people sleep better.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.260]   You don't need to hear the surveys.
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.260]   Hear it from me.
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:25.980]   I sleep worse without it.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:29.700]   So even better, the 8 Sleep recently launched the next generation of their pod.
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:34.100]   The new pod three enables more accurate sleep and health tracking with double the amount
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.260]   of sensors delivering the best experience on earth.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.980]   Yeah, it gives you information about your sleep, by the way.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.260]   So it'll actually tell you if you look at the app like, hey, you slept this much last
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.020]   night, here's, you know, et cetera.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.020]   Cool technology.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.060]   So the pod's not magic, but it feels like it.
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:50.580]   I'm a big 8 Sleep fan.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.860]   You sleep hot.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860]   You got to try it.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   You got to try it.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:58.660]   So go to 8sleep.com/deep to save $150 on the pod.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:01.660]   That's E-I-G-H-T sleep.com/deep.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:04.260]   You need that slash deep to get the $150 off.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:12.420]   8 Sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada, the UK, select countries in the EU and Australia.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.060]   I want you and I want just like an 8 Sleep chair.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:21.140]   You know, so like I don't have to make the podcast studio frigid.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:24.980]   If I just had like an 8 Sleep chair, you know, just like take it, just keep taking like a
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.980]   little bit of heat off of me.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.980]   That'd be great.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:29.180]   I could podcast all day.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.620]   David Sachs made a lot of comments about the temperature of the studio.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:35.420]   Oh yeah, he couldn't take it.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.340]   I don't want to cast aspersions.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:41.180]   David Sachs did not like the cool weather, but different people run hot and different
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:42.180]   people run cold.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:46.300]   When I'm doing an event, my concern is like I'm going to be too hot.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.300]   It's always my concern.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.180]   I'm never worried I'm going to be too cold.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:56.380]   Sachs came to that event at East City Books wearing a sweater and a jacket and a shirt.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:02.700]   I could never, if I had like an undershirt, a dress shirt, a sweater and a blazer on,
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.380]   I mean, I would just faint.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.020]   I'd be like, thank you for coming out.
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:10.700]   Faint, you know, but you know, some people are very different.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:14.140]   So if Sachs was using the eight sleep, he would probably be on the positive side of
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.140]   the, of the scale.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.140]   Like I don't want to get too cold.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   I'm the opposite way.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:23.020]   I don't want to get, I don't get, honestly, I, to me, the optimal outfit for like doing
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:29.020]   an event, like giving a speech or something, and I, this would be a, might not be the image
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.300]   I want to give.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.300]   It would be like a loose pair of athletic shorts and no shirt.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:42.180]   I don't know how this would go over on the today show or, you know, what I'm doing, Tim
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:45.580]   Ferriss's podcast, and we're on the video screen, but honestly, that's what I would
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.260]   be the most comfortable in outside in October.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.180]   So there's like, it's not frozen, but it's like 50 degrees out and there's like a brisk,
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.180]   a light is brisk.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.180]   I'm shirtless.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:00.140]   I try it, but you know, the event organizers never love it.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.140]   All right.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   Let's also talk about Grammarly.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.540]   Grammarly was the original, I believe they were the original sponsor of this show.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:13.100]   And for good reason, I make my living as right as a writer.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:17.580]   But even if you're not a professional writer, clarity in your expression and written word
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.260]   is at the core of almost every profession.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:25.940]   It seems these days, if you can express yourself clearly, confidently with the right tone,
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:30.140]   makes such a difference, especially as more and more work is remote, more and more communication
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:33.100]   is happening on email, more and more communications happening on Slack.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:38.140]   It's never been more important to be clear in your writing.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.420]   This is where Grammarly enters the scene.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:45.020]   It's like having a professional editor looking over your shoulder as you write every email
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.500]   and send every chat message.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.900]   Grammarly is free to download and works where you do.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:54.640]   And so it will help you be clear and get your projects done faster.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.260]   So if you start with the free version of Grammarly, what you're going to get is comprehensive
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.940]   spelling, grammar and punctuation suggestions.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.540]   So this is going to make sure you don't make mistakes.
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.660]   You're not going to misspell words.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.900]   You're not going to get grammar wrong.
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.900]   Like, don't do this.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.140]   That's the wrong form of there.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:10.140]   This is possessive.
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.540]   It shouldn't be.
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.900]   You probably should have a semicolon here, not a comma.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.820]   So the free version of Grammarly is going to make you come across sharp, right?
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:22.260]   This is a good writer who doesn't make mistakes, very professional.
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:26.980]   Where the magic really starts to happen, I think, is with the premium version of Grammarly,
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:32.060]   which keeps all of the world class spell checking, grammar checking, et cetera.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.480]   And it adds clarity focused sentence rewrites.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.340]   So this is where it'll actually say, rewrite the sentence this way.
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.980]   It'll make your point clear.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.300]   It's simpler.
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:49.540]   This is where you begin to get that reputation as a particularly clear communicator.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:53.980]   When people see your super sharp sentences, they just think you're smarter.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.340]   You're going to get promoted faster.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.540]   People are going to have more respect for you.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:04.060]   Grammarly also has, once you're at the premium version, a tone detector.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.980]   That might be in both versions.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.380]   I'm not quite sure about that.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:11.780]   But it has a tone detector, which will look at what you write and say, this is what we're
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:12.860]   detecting on tone.
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:16.300]   I wrote about this issue in my book, A World Without Email.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:22.620]   We're very bad at judging for ourselves the tone of our written communication.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.160]   We think we're being funny.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.060]   We think we're being sarcastic.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.260]   The other person thinks you're mad at them.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:32.300]   Grammarly's tone detector helps you come in and recognize when this is not the tone that
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.540]   you're going for.
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:38.820]   So in today's world, especially remote focused knowledge work, you have to be a clear communicator.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.860]   It means you have to have Grammarly.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:45.260]   So get more time in your day, get more done, be more confident in your communication with
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:46.260]   Grammarly.

[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:18.680]   All right, Jesse, for our last segment of the day, I call this three interesting things.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:25.160]   These are things that I either came across on my own or were sent to me in my interesting@calnewport.com
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.360]   email address that I found interesting, and I will share them with you now.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.200]   All relevant links to each of these things are in the show notes.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:40.320]   All right, the first interesting thing is a news report, a news report out of Cleveland,
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.320]   Ohio.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.720]   And I've loaded this on the tablet for those who are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:49.880]   If you want to find this, this is the video for episode 224.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:58.920]   All right, so here's an article from Ohio in particular, Warrensville Heights, Ohio,
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.120]   at the T-Squared Honors Academy.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.920]   This is a charter school in Ohio.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.340]   So this is a report from NBC News.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:11.200]   So what happened with this charter school is coming back from COVID-19 last year, they
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.960]   had a lot of challenges, especially with discipline, etc.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.920]   So the leaders of this charter school started looking through their data to say, what is
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.080]   causing these issues?
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.680]   And what they found is that the bulk of the problems, and I'm quoting this article now,
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.240]   were linked either directly or indirectly to cell phones.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.740]   Students were scrolling social media, playing games and late to class because they were
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:39.300]   making TikToks in the hall.
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:43.960]   So last week we talked about a boarding school, or was this two weeks ago, Jesse, when we
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.540]   talked about the boarding school?
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.540]   Last week?
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.540]   I think it was two weeks ago.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:50.400]   Two weeks ago, we talked about a boarding school that banned smartphones.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.740]   We said, okay, you can kind of do that at a boarding school.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.360]   Would this work at just a normal, this is a charter school, but a school you just go
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.020]   to in the morning and come home.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:00.300]   Here's how they solve the logistical problem.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:04.720]   They're using yonder, Y-O-N-D-R bags.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.780]   These are the bags that they use at, for example, performances, comedians that are working on
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:15.360]   a new set, a big comedian like Dave Chappelle, they will have you put your phone into one
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.360]   of these bags.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.320]   And what happens with these bags is you get to keep your phone.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:23.040]   So it solves the issue of, oh, we have to store everyone's phone and get it back to
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.040]   them.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.040]   If there's an emergency, they can't get it.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.280]   You get to keep your phone, but it's in this bag.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.760]   And as long as it's in this bag, it can't receive, it's a Faraday cage in a bag form.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.480]   It can't receive calls, can't receive texts.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.000]   So you keep it with you, but it can't work.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.880]   And then when you leave the performance hall, you take it back out.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.800]   Well, at the school, they're like, great, you can keep your phone, but you have to keep
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.840]   it in this bag.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.180]   So that solves the logistical problem of how do we collect phones from 200 kids.
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.680]   But it also introduces an environment where no one's on their phone.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.560]   And now, of course, it's really easy to see violators here.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.960]   If you see anyone holding a phone, anyone taking it out of their bag, you say, okay,
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.080]   look, discipline.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.780]   So they use these yonder bags.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.440]   Students lock up their phones, and I'm quoting the article here, from the moment they walk
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.280]   into the school to the time they are dismissed at the end of the day.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.880]   All right, so how did this go?
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.160]   Well, I have a couple of quotes here.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.240]   So this charter school was initially worried about enrollment dropping with this new policy
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.720]   because the charter school, so people can choose to not go there anymore.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:22.320]   They ended up having the opposite problem.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.560]   More parents wanted to send their kids to this charter school specifically because of
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.280]   their policy of putting the phones in these bags.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.520]   Here is a couple of other quotes.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.360]   Here's from the principal.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.260]   It's taken a layer of distraction and stress for some kids away.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.960]   So it's great to see.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.440]   The principal went on to say that transitioning to the pouches was surprisingly smooth for
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.440]   the students.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:47.200]   And most of all, it's been refreshing to see kids just being kids again at lunch, in the
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:50.760]   halls and at recess, interacting, having fun, talking.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:55.240]   At recess, they're playing football, basketball, and just being kids.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.520]   It turns out that over 25 schools in Ohio are using these cell phone bags to get cell
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.840]   phones out of the schools, including six in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.840]   alone.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.040]   That's where this particular charter academy is.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:15.160]   There's over 1,200 schools across the country that are doing something similar.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:19.840]   A survey of 900 of these schools that are putting cell phones in these bags throughout
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:26.280]   the day found that 74 reported an improvement in student behavior, 65% have an improvement
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.520]   in academic performance.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:34.160]   Anyone in school reform knows those percentages are massive.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:38.720]   That's like magic bean level, almost like don't try to find some intervention that's
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.160]   going to make such a difference in schools.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.160]   This one thing is.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.920]   Anyways, I like this article.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:50.000]   I found it interesting because it shows this notion that kids these days have to have their
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.400]   phones.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.240]   There's no way to take them away.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.400]   Pandora's box has been opened.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.920]   All we can do is just say we had our own things when we were kids, our parents understand
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.000]   they have theirs.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.800]   Those arguments do not have strong support.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.760]   There's over a thousand schools already in this country that takes kids' phones away,
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.080]   and they're almost all finding very positive benefits.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.600]   It's almost like a secret weapon to improvement of school environments.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:22.040]   So I no longer accept the argument of kids these days as a way of maintaining the status
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.400]   quo with phones.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:26.960]   A lot of schools are doing things about it, and the kids are happier, the teachers are
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.260]   happier, performance is up, discipline is up.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:30.520]   So to me, that's good.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   That's progress.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.040]   So that is an interesting thing.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.040]   All right.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:39.680]   My second interesting thing is one of these buzzy articles from the Atlantic that is making
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.680]   the rounds.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.800]   It's from November 10th.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:49.880]   It's titled The Age of Social Media is Ending, written by Ian Bogost or Bogost.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.840]   The subtitle is It Never Should Have Begun.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.600]   It has just what I think is a confusing graphic.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:01.000]   So for those who are watching on the YouTube channel, I thought this was a white domino
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.720]   with blue, three blue dots that for some reason had a little thing coming out of it.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:13.360]   But I guess this is like a plastic version of, I don't know, like the I'm typing in text
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.360]   message bubble.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.440]   Do you think that's right?
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.960]   It looks kind of like a speech bubble with three dots in it.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.960]   Or is that a Twitter thing?
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960]   I don't really know.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:26.120]   >>AJ Yeah, it looks like a text thing with the dots.
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.420]   >>DAVE So look, not to blame here, but this is an article about social media not texting.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:33.520]   So I don't know about this graphic choice.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:39.160]   But if we can make it past there, this is a buzzy article.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:41.360]   It starts by saying it's over.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.640]   Facebook is in decline.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.600]   Twitter is in chaos.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.720]   Mark Zuckerberg's empire has lost hundreds of billions of dollars and laid off 11,000
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:51.400]   people, blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:56.400]   It never felt more plausible that the age of social media might end and soon.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.820]   But now that we've washed up on this unexpected shore, we can look back at the shipwreck that
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.260]   left us here with fresh eyes.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.320]   And perhaps here we can find some relief.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.800]   Social media was never a natural way to work, play, and socialize, though it did become
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:07.800]   second nature.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.800]   All right.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.560]   So basically, I'm glad this is spreading.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.400]   And Jesse, you can back me up here.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.000]   But my reaction to this is, all right, well, welcome to my party.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.920]   I've been hosting this for a while now.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.040]   I mean, it really was about two years ago that I began going on major shows and saying,
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.280]   you guys don't understand that the decline of social media has already been set into
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.280]   motion.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.560]   That this age of these monopolies being at the center of cultural life, the apex of that
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]   has already passed.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.360]   You just don't notice it yet.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.000]   And there's going to be this decline in fragmentation.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.160]   And no one really bought that.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.800]   And now like a year or two later, I feel like I was right.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.880]   That A, it is fragmenting like I predicted it would.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.840]   And B, that's good because it's very unnatural.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:00.080]   These are the two things that no one would accept in 2020 or 2019.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.120]   No one would accept that it was somehow unnatural, all of this tweeting back and forth and Instagram
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.120]   with these tags.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.480]   And you click on these icons and you forward these things and you swipe on the phone.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:13.960]   And I'm saying, this is so out of character, human character.
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.720]   This is an artificial way to interact.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.920]   It is a perversion of the internet to try to run it through a small number of walled
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.060]   gardens.
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.080]   And this is very unstable and it's not going to last.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.160]   And no one came around to that.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:29.200]   But now in this article, it's being proposed and what's happening now.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.480]   So welcome to my party.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.720]   And I'm glad people are, I guess I'm glad people are showing up.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.520]   This may be maybe the way I'll think about it.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.520]   People are coming to your party.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.520]   Like I'm in my party.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.520]   All right, let's do the third interesting thing.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.520]   All right.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:47.500]   So here, what I'm going to do for this third interesting thing is I haven't read this yet.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.680]   Someone sent this to me.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.720]   The concept sounded great.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.520]   So we can discover this together.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.720]   So this is an article from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.720]   Let me get the date.
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:00.720]   I think this is recent.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720]   Let's see here.
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720]   November 17th.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.720]   All right.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.720]   So here's the name of this article.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.680]   And this is all I know about this so far is the article and subtitle, but you'll see
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:09.480]   why this caught my attention.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480]   Here's the title.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.120]   Eat, Pray, Heard.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:19.300]   How an IT guy found career happiness owning 78 camels.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:25.300]   And the subhead is Muhammad Isaac grew tired of office life in Canada.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:31.640]   So he returned to a Somaliland birthplace and took up an ancient trade.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.140]   So speaking of deep life and deep resets, getting back in touch with something, making
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:40.840]   a radical move, getting back in touch with values, shaping your life in a very intentional
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:41.840]   way.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.720]   This seems like it's one of those canonical examples.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.720]   All right.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.680]   So let's let's get just a couple of details here together.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.680]   Let's see.
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.560]   He took 78 camels, but Muhammad Isaac is no longer miserable and reversal.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.560]   The usual way of things.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.560]   Mr.
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.280]   Isaac had fled distress of city life in the West to become a camel herder in the drought
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.800]   stricken scrub lands of Eastern Africa.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.240]   Oh, Jesse, is that all cliche?
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:13.480]   If I had a dime for every knowledge worker, he reacted to the stress of the life, the
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:17.480]   move to drought stricken Africa to raise camels.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.160]   I would have one dime.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.440]   I'm going to let me just push back.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:26.000]   We're reading this together live in the reversal, the usual way to do things.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.160]   That's not a reversal right now.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.160]   The usual way to do things.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.080]   I mean, if anything, this is the big trend of the last three years is especially knowledge
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:35.440]   workers radically rebuilding their lives in ways are more valuable.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:41.800]   So I would say in a further exemplification or a particularly strong example of how things
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.640]   are going now.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.640]   Mr.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.640]   Isaac fled the stress of the city.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:51.480]   I mean, unless the implication here is the usual way of doing things is that camel herders
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:56.520]   from the scrub lands in Eastern Africa moved to Canada to become IT professionals.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.520]   Then that might make sense, but I don't know how strong that pipeline is.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.520]   All right.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:02.360]   We get a little more details here.
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.360]   Mr.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.120]   Isaac worked as a computer network administrator in Ottawa.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.120]   This is not fair, Jesse.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.720]   I don't know if you agree with this, but for some reason I, you know, office life is something
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.720]   I don't love.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.720]   I like to be my own boss.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.080]   For some reason it feels like office life in Canada is probably even worse.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:21.640]   It's like even like nicer and more bland, like at least in the U S like you're going
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.600]   to have one or two people who are kind of crazy and it's, you know, like a, there'll
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.480]   be like the Q and on guy and at least there'll be like some excitement, right.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:35.080]   Or like the guy who has like way too into, you know, weightlifting or the, like, I'm
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.200]   really into the woman really in the goop.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.840]   And like, at least you're going to have some wacky characters that sort of also like are
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.840]   very threatening.
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:43.840]   So there's like some spice to it.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.440]   I just feel like in Canada, everyone would just be, it'd be like really nice.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.600]   Not as fun.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:52.320]   Anyway, so he returned, we'll just, we'll just skip through this, but this is just to
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.400]   get the highlights here.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.800]   He has a long family history of the, of the camel herding.
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.840]   So he's not just doing this from scratch.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.600]   And what he says is what's important is happiness.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.920]   So it's interesting.
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.120]   The nomad life is not easy.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.360]   He also adds, but this is our heritage.
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.700]   He's 53.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:15.960]   He looks much younger because he worked as an IT administrator his whole life instead
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.480]   of a camel herder.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480]   He worries about sunburn.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.560]   That's some interesting details here.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.400]   Interesting details.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:27.840]   So you know, this is cool.
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:31.960]   Let's just pull out the, there's a lot of interesting history of Somalia, Somalia here
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.960]   and other types of things.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:39.600]   It's a good article, but I'm just, I'm scrolling here as we read.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.000]   It's about how he learned how to do this.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.540]   He read camel herding books, not a lucrative niche in the publishing industry.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:47.020]   I can tell you that from experience.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:49.700]   They watched a documentary called Camelicious.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.320]   All right.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:56.140]   And he learned how to do it, move there and began camel herding.
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:01.140]   So I think the takeaway message of that interesting thing is not to become a camel herder, but
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:05.100]   look at the general outline of what Muhammad Isaac did here.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:06.860]   He stepped back to do a deep reset.
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.820]   He was a network administrator in Ottawa.
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:10.360]   He was bored.
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.580]   He felt disconnected from his heritage and his family.
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:15.500]   So he said, let me do some equivalent of a deep reset.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:17.420]   What are, what's important to me?
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:19.940]   How can I radically realign my life around what's important to me?
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:25.400]   And for him, reconnecting to a ancient family trade from his homeland that he had left and
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:31.940]   felt disconnected from, that is pure intention, a crafting of a life around things that really
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.280]   matter, throwing in a dash of radicalness and doing so.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:40.840]   That general structure I think is replicatable in a lot of different specific flavors.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.540]   So I should say that general recipe is implementable in a lot of different flavors.
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:51.200]   But what, what I think these type of deep reset share is that intentionality, values
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.560]   based and radicalness.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.760]   I want to be very careful about how I craft my life.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:00.800]   I want to base this off of what's important to me and I'm willing to do radical things
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:01.800]   to follow it.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.120]   So you don't have to become a camel herder, but a lot of people have their own, probably
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.440]   equivalent of camel herding in their own life.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.120]   Heritage, family, connection, things really important to them that you could make a radical
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.120]   change around.
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.080]   So that was definitely a interesting thing.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.120]   All right, Jesse, I think we've talked enough today.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.760]   Let's wrap things up.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.760]   Thank you everyone who sent in their questions and left voicemails and did live calls and
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.960]   sent in interesting things.
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.960]   Wow.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]   We really have a lot of interaction going on.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.600]   So thanks for that, everybody.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:34.720]   We will be back next week with another episode of the Deep Questions Podcast.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.320]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:48.720]   [Music]
