[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.360]   - Folks, my name is John Luskin.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.920]   You may remember me from such shows as Bogleheads Live
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.520]   and doing a brief stint on the
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.220]   Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.060]   Today I am here to once again interview Bill Bangin.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960]   I previously interviewed Bill on episode 35
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.600]   of the Bogleheads Live show.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   If you guys wanna check that out, go to boglecenter.net.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800]   And if you like what you hear,

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.760]   Let me introduce a man that needs no introduction.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   Bill Bangin received his BS from MIT
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.860]   in aerospace engineering.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.000]   He's had four careers,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.520]   including his third in fee-only financial planning,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.280]   where in the early '90s,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.240]   in an attempt to answer questions from clients,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.760]   he began his research on sustainable spending in retirement
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   leading to the 4% rule of thumb that we all know today.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960]   Bill, welcome to the 2024 Bogleheads Conference.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.800]   - Yeah, thanks.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.400]   I appreciate the invitation.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.580]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.800]   - Folks, I am gonna start asking Bill some questions
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   that I got beforehand from the Bogleheads communities online
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.720]   but if you have a question,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.240]   go ahead, get a pen, some paper, write it down.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.720]   And then Karen is gonna be going around
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.080]   collecting the questions.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   There she is.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.320]   Fantastic.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.240]   So let's start with the basics.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   Tell us about the 4% rule.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.400]   What is it?
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.500]   - I have no idea, quite frankly.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.240]   We're really talking about something
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.760]   that technically doesn't exist,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   or at least I never created it.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.320]   I did a paper in '94, October,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.160]   it's almost 30 years ago, next month,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   in which I took a very preliminary look
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   at what kind of withdrawal rate,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   safe withdrawal rate retirees
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.480]   could use under the worst conditions,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.240]   worst case conditions.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.400]   And that turned out to be 4.15%.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.960]   And I just put that paper out there.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.880]   And I wrote other papers but they kind of got ignored
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   and people focused on that first paper
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   and they approximated the 4.15% to 4%
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.780]   and then they went further and said,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780]   "Well, that's a rule we can all follow."
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.120]   Which I never said because my belief as a financial advisor,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.840]   every individual, every client
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.520]   has unique needs in retirement
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.600]   and the process for getting to a quote number
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   is a lot more complicated
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.320]   than using just a simple one size fits all rule.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.280]   - Wonderful.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.400]   Tell us about some of your more recent research.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720]   What have you found continuing to research this subject?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   How has the answer changed?
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.080]   - Okay, well now we have, I think, the 5% rule, if you will.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.280]   I've been, over time,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.200]   I've been making my research more sophisticated.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.480]   I've been adding ACID classes.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.940]   My first paper used only two ACID classes,
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.460]   which is hardly a diversified portfolio.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.800]   When I added small caps in 2006, just one more ACID class,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   it went from 4.15% to 4.5, which was a nice jump,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   but that's still a long way from a diversified portfolio.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   And more recently, I used seven ACID classes,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.160]   adding mid caps and international stock, micro caps.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.900]   And when I did that, I got up to just about 4.7%.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.540]   Once again, this is for the worst case scenario.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.820]   Yeah, I studied 400 retirees
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.580]   retiring on the first date of each quarter,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.060]   beginning in January 1st, 1926.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.040]   So there's almost 400, 100 years of data there.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.540]   And only one of those 400 individuals
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.000]   was constrained with that low worst case rate.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.260]   Everyone else was higher.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.020]   Most were quite a bit higher.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.100]   The average for all retirees
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.700]   across that 100-year period is 7%.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.500]   If you wanna have a rule, you gotta use a 7% rule, you know?
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.820]   Although, for the last 25 years,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.380]   I've not been able to find a retiree who was average.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.640]   It's because of the high valuations in the stock market.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.220]   We've been toward the lower end of the spectrum,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.340]   but still, you know, above 5%, in my opinion.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.900]   - That's a great segue into another question
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.100]   related to what we had to find from the community.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.100]   Given that valuations are high,
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100]   what impact do valuations have
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.260]   on sustainable spending in retirement?
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.600]   - Okay, that's really an interesting question.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.400]   And that leads into the conclusion
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.140]   I reached early in my research,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.300]   which everybody knows,
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.160]   that if you run into a major bear market in stocks
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.500]   early in retirement, it damages your portfolio,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.260]   and therefore, will reduce your retirement withdrawal rate.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   And to get to that point where you have
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.700]   a major bear market early in retirement,
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.220]   they almost all occur from periods of high valuation.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.060]   With stock markets rarely collapse
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.220]   when they have a P/E of 10 or 12 or something like that.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.480]   Almost all the major bear markets in history
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.020]   have come from much higher.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.940]   And we certainly know that in this century.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.460]   And in 2008, a colleague of mine, Michael Kitsies,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.380]   who you probably know, a brilliant guy,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.740]   published a paper, actually in his newsletter,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.180]   and a wonderful chart in which he tracked
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.500]   stock market valuations year by year since 1926,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.460]   even back further, against the withdrawal rate
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.700]   that would have applied to that particular year.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.800]   And it's an amazing chart because it shows
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.380]   that withdrawal rates and stock market valuation
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.260]   move in opposite directions, which you'd kind of expect.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.220]   In other words, the more expensive the stock market is
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.100]   early in retirement, the more likely you are
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.900]   to have a bear market and the lower the withdrawal rate.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.140]   However, if you were fortunate enough to retire
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.100]   at a time of really low stock market valuations,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.340]   you would be able to take quite a bit more,
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.680]   quite a bit above average.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.940]   And when I saw that chart, I nearly jumped out of my chair.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.180]   I remember the moment, opening that publication,
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.500]   looking and saying, my gosh, this is the answer.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.320]   Because up to that point, what guidance
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.180]   could I have given my clients to decide
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.460]   what their withdrawal rate would be?
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.980]   That was a real issue in the early years.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.880]   I could draw a chart, I could count the number of retirees,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.140]   let's say, who could retire successfully at 4 1/2%.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.500]   That was 100%, let's say, in my earlier research.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.300]   And then if I increased the withdrawal rate to 5%,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.140]   maybe 95% of the people would have been able
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.780]   to successfully negotiate retirement.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.660]   Then I went to 5 1/2%, maybe it was 90,
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.140]   and I go through the whole list.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.700]   And so I have a chart which basically assigned
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.140]   to each withdrawal rate, up to 10, 12, 13%,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.900]   the probability, based on history,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.740]   that you would have been able to successfully withdraw.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.780]   The problem is with that, how does an individual choose
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.540]   what's the appropriate probability for them to use?
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.380]   What criteria?
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.620]   I always felt when I gave a client this chart
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.800]   and said, here it is, you can figure out the probability,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.140]   I don't have a clue, it was kind of like
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.500]   sending them off to Vegas with one of those blackjack charts
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   where it kind of says hold on 17 and get hit on 16
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.760]   and split eights and take insurance and do this.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.840]   So I felt very uncomfortable with that whole issue.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.380]   And really, particularly uncomfortable
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.540]   because it's at the very beginning of the process.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.100]   If you're developing a plan for your withdrawals,
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   that's one of the first issues you want to take a look at.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.740]   And it wasn't until three summers ago,
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.580]   actually 27 years into my research,
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.860]   that I found what I call a missing link,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.900]   which is inflation.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.460]   I knew inflation had to be a factor
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.820]   'cause we know stock market, bear markets,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.340]   are really powerful determinants of withdrawal rates,
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.900]   but the correlation is not close enough
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.420]   to confidently predict what the withdrawal rate should be
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.340]   based upon the stock market valuation.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.020]   There's just too much slosh,
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.140]   it's maybe only a 75% correlation.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.500]   I needed higher and I used to sit and look and think
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.940]   and drive myself crazy and say,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.420]   no, inflation is in there somewhere,
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.180]   but I keep drawing charts of stock market valuation
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.420]   and I put down the inflation rates associated with it
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.740]   and it's a messy chart, I don't see a pattern.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.700]   And then I remember one summer morning,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.460]   I got up early and I was just thinking about this problem
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.540]   and I just had this flash.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.900]   I said, wow, what if instead of treating withdrawal
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.060]   of the stock market valuation first,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.460]   why don't we make inflation the most important factor?
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.580]   Very powerful because you have to increase your withdrawal rates,
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.460]   they're gonna get stuck at this higher level
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.260]   for the rest of retirement.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260]   So what I did was create six inflation regimes,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260]   three in the inflation side,
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.500]   moderate, low and high inflation,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.100]   three on the deflation side,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.300]   moderate, low and high deflation,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.100]   and then put the stock market valuation within them
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.620]   and the chart was beautiful.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.500]   So I was able to, from that, create a chart
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.180]   starting with the inflation regime you think you're in
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.820]   and within it list the stock market valuations
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.820]   of Shiller CAPE and that gave me a tool
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.500]   that's about 85 to 90% correlation.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.180]   That gave me the confidence to say,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.780]   "I can now, somebody comes to me
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.540]   "and tells me when they retire,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.860]   "the stock market's valued this high
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.100]   "and on top of it, we have the inflation rate we know,
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.500]   "I can suggest now a withdrawal rate
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.420]   "which might not be the worst case.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.340]   "It might be five, might be six,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.860]   "might be seven, might be 10 if we get lucky
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.340]   "and we get a low stock market valuation."
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.220]   So finally that problem for the first time after,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.700]   I'm sorry, it took 27 years folks to get that done,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.740]   but it looks like I've got a solution to that problem there.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.140]   - Wonderful.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.220]   Let's geek out a little bit on the numbers
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.700]   as we're all investment fans here.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.580]   Let's talk about some of the data
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.420]   and some of the approach that you used.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.980]   So we got a question here that asks about
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.060]   how fees show up in a distribution rate.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.860]   So certainly if we're using a low cost index fund,
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.460]   that's gonna be easy 'cause it's gonna have
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.580]   a very small effect on how much we're spending.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.620]   Has your research looked at the different fees
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.900]   in the various indices that you've used?
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.340]   For example, small cap funds,
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.500]   those might be more expensive to trade given illiquidity.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.900]   Has that shown up in your research
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   as well as relatedly a question here about advisor fees?
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.180]   What work would be done on fees
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.700]   and how that impacts portfolio distribution rates?
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.820]   - Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.420]   In my research, I don't concern myself with fees.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.860]   I'm assuming today, at least as far as funds,
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.340]   using fund investments,
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.740]   what I assume I'm using in my research,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.820]   that there will be none.
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.820]   And we've practically come to that point.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.300]   There are no commissions really on trades anymore.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.260]   We're in a commission free environment.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.380]   When I first did my research 30 years ago,
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.500]   if you'd asked me that question,
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.100]   I might have been a little bit embarrassed
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.940]   because wow, they were still a factor, but not anymore.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.420]   The advisor fees are though, and I had a friend
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.460]   some years ago did a study of that.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.900]   You have advisor fees of 1%, 1.25%.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.100]   They're a significant factor.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.780]   But I don't take them into consideration
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.500]   for the simple reason that they vary so much
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.700]   from individual to individual.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.380]   I can't give a consistent result.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.260]   And what I suggest is that people,
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.980]   when you do your budget for retirement,
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.660]   your expense budget, is that is an expense item
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.900]   and it's different for everyone.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.540]   So, but actually it has to be taken into account.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.780]   - All right.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.780]   And folks, if you have a question, write it down,
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.780]   Karen will collect it and then she'll bring it up here
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.340]   and we can ask Bill Bangor your question.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.500]   Let's jump to some other questions we got
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.020]   from the Bogleheads community beforehand.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.900]   This one comes from Fender Strat Guy
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.780]   from Bogleheads Reddit.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.220]   Shout out to Bogleheads Reddit, by the way.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.900]   They asked some great questions.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.260]   He wants to know what your thoughts are on your research,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.140]   which looks at historical data
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.500]   versus a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.980]   - Yeah.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.740]   Theoretically they should both give similar results
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.220]   and I think they do.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.660]   I'm kind of anomaly.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.100]   I don't think too many do the way I'm looking
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.300]   at it myself right now.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.820]   Most people are using Monte Carlo simulations.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.780]   They're both legitimate approaches.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.660]   I just feel comfortable using historical data
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.980]   because I kind of enjoy talking to people
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.420]   about 1947 there, we had an inflation outbreak
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.980]   and it affected the withdrawal rate or 1962.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.460]   Some people can relate, I think, a lot easier
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.780]   to actual historical periods they may have lived through
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.740]   to thousands of anonymous trials.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.700]   But as a technical tool, it's perfectly valid.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.900]   A lot of people do their research, I respect it
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.940]   and fortunately we come up something fairly close.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.620]   - And for those who aren't super investment nerds,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.100]   as you may already know,
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.900]   probably doesn't need much explanation,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.820]   Bill's research looks at what has happened in the past,
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.020]   what could I have spent in the past from my portfolio.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.820]   Monte Carlo simulation, we're gonna tell a computer,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.860]   "Hey, this is what investment returns were.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.220]   "Now I want you to make up what investment returns
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.740]   "are gonna be in the future."
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.740]   And then do that maybe 1,000 or 10,000 times.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.100]   How many of those times did the particular situation
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.620]   run out of money or have enough?
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.540]   And that's gonna be a success rate,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.740]   that is a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.140]   Christine Benz, who we'll get to chat with later,
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.780]   she used that in doing her research
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.620]   on sustainable spending in retirement.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.140]   - John, can I make just a brief comment?
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.620]   - Yeah, no, please. - Out of the blue.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.700]   I'm just curious, this conference is named
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.020]   after John Bogle, a great man.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.260]   I'm just curious how many out in the audience
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.860]   might have had a fortune enough
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.660]   to have met Mr. Bogle at some time?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.260]   - Not too many, I just wanna say it's a privilege
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.860]   to be at a conference named after him.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.660]   I did meet him once.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.700]   It was in my early years as an advisor,
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.020]   early '90s, I think, I got asked to join
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.980]   what Vanguard called their advisory council.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.260]   And twice a year, we'd fly out to Valley Forge
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.820]   and we'd meet with the executives at Vanguard
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.340]   and we'd talk about items of mutual interest.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.180]   And one year, Mr. Bogle came out to talk with us
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.180]   and Mr. Bogle was my hero and still is a hero for me.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.780]   He was an extraordinary individual
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   and a very imposing individual.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.620]   He was big and big boned and he had this magnificent voice.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.620]   I mean, he probably could have put James Earl Jones
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.260]   out of business as Darth Vader if he wanted to.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.740]   He was powerful, but he was also a very kind man.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.820]   And he answered my ignorant early year questions
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.580]   as an advisor with great consideration.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.740]   And I just think it's wonderful
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   you've named this organization as a conference after him
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.740]   because he is deserving, in my opinion,
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.180]   he was a titan and still is a titan of the financial world.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.300]   So privileged to speak at a conference named after him.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.140]   - Wonderful.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.900]   - Do we have some, okay, great.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.020]   Thank you, Karen.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.980]   All right, let's jump to another question
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.580]   from the BogleHeads community that we got from beforehand.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.020]   This one is from Man of Clouds from BogleHeads Reddit
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.180]   and he asks about, I have traditional 401k,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.340]   I've got a Roth IRA,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.300]   I've got a plain vanilla taxable account.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.260]   What should I be thinking about
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260]   with respect to distributions for the 4% rule
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.860]   across these different types of accounts?
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.020]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.260]   I assume in my research
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.820]   that you're probably gonna have one primary account
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.860]   for which you're gonna withdraw during retirement.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.420]   And that's very important,
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.500]   whether it's a taxable or tax deferred
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.340]   or tax advantage count.
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.260]   There are different withdrawal rates for each one.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.940]   That's one of eight factors I looked at.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.700]   I'm just finishing up a book on this whole thing.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.860]   We're gonna take my whole 30 years of experience
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.500]   and put it out for the world to see.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.980]   And that's one of the, what I call,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.380]   one of the eight important elements
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.820]   to compute your withdrawal rate
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.500]   is knowing what type of account you have.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.660]   Withdrawal rates for taxable accounts
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.660]   are obviously less than they are for tax advantage accounts.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.380]   But it depends upon the tax rate.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.700]   In my book, I use what I call
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.020]   a computed average tax rate for your account.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.180]   Then I'll have a chart
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.180]   showing you what the withdrawal rate would be.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.060]   It could be 10% less, could be 20% less or more
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.700]   than for a tax deferred account.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.660]   - All right, so let's talk about
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.740]   how does the 4% rule apply to early retirees,
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.620]   folks who have a long retirement in front of them.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.380]   - Sure, this is one of the eight factors in,
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.700]   which is planning horizon, essentially.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.580]   It's a very important issue.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.540]   The so-called 4% rule applied to 30 years.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.740]   For folks, let's say, who have very short retirements,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.220]   let's say 10 years, you could get up to 8% or 9%.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.980]   When you get to longer retirements,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.580]   which I know a lot of folks are very interested in,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.140]   40 years, 50 years, or more,
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.980]   the retirement rate, let's say we were at 5%,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.460]   starts to decline, but it kind of does so,
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.580]   somebody would use asymptotically,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.860]   where it approaches a level of around 4.3%.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.140]   And this is a worst-case scenario.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.780]   We're talking, once again,
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.700]   so that if you get out even 100 years or 150 years,
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.620]   you're gonna be about 4.3% or so.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.860]   I don't know what the exact number is,
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.340]   but it's pretty close to that.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.180]   So that, yes, the withdrawal rate is very sensitive
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.900]   to the time horizon that you use.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.900]   - So what withdrawal rate would you suggest
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.740]   for someone who has a long timeline in front of them?
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.460]   - What would I suggest here?
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.420]   Well, you know, I'd have to look at all the eight factors.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.220]   In addition, that's just one of the eight factors.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.060]   That's why I'm trying to get away
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   from the use of the term rule, 4% rule.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.540]   Oh, I must admit, I'm a complete hypocrite in that regard,
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.020]   'cause I recently changed my Arizona license plate
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.100]   to read Mr. 4%.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.940]   And part of the reason is because every time
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.500]   that I go to a hotel, park my car,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.900]   they ask me for the license plate,
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.980]   which I could never remember.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.900]   Now I can remember my license plate when they ask it.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.140]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:57.620]   Thoughts on 3% as a distribution rate for early retirees.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.460]   - I'm sorry?
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.740]   - Oh, what are your thoughts on a 3% distribution rate
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.860]   for early retirees?
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.860]   - 3% seems unnecessarily penurous.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:15.660]   I think you're gonna find yourself late in retirement
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.060]   extremely wealthy with a lot of regret, in my opinion.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.740]   If you want to have a decent lifestyle,
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.460]   I don't know why you would want to necessarily spend it all
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.780]   unless you're very fearful about something that I'm,
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.620]   you know, I tend to be an optimist overall.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.780]   I think we'll get through our situations,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.380]   whatever we're facing, you know.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.780]   I think 3% is overdoing it a bit.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.780]   I can't, you know, I run models.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.180]   When somebody asked me a question, I said,
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.900]   well, what kind of combination of circumstances
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.060]   would it take to force somebody into a worst case 3%?
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.660]   It would take probably 20 years of 10% inflation
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.180]   and a 70% bear market.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.620]   And we haven't seen that coming.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.260]   I hope we don't, you know.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.420]   But that's kind of the thing it would take
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.140]   to force this into 3%, in my opinion, yeah.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.820]   - So in your research, you looked at,
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.940]   original research rather, you looked at large cap
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.940]   and intermediate term treasuries for the portfolio.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.100]   This question asks, when you do pay yourself,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.900]   when you do make your distributions,
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.380]   should you sell equally across both stocks and bonds?
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.340]   - Oh, rebalancing at the end of the year,
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.900]   which is another important factor.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.380]   Generally, you will be selling off the assets
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.020]   who have outperformed, whether it be stocks or bonds,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.740]   and, you know, then buying assets that have underperformed.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.380]   And that has a beautiful, rebalancing,
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.020]   it's just so important in doing that in a portfolio.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.620]   I have some illustrations in my book.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.340]   If you take a look at the seven asset classes I have
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.460]   and calculate an expected one-year return,
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.860]   I think you come out with around 8.5%, something like that.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.940]   But if you look at the portfolios run over 50-year periods,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.780]   compounding and rebalancing once a year,
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.300]   they average 10% a year.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.260]   That extra return is generated
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.740]   by the benefits of rebalancing,
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.620]   where you're naturally selling off assets
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.700]   that have done well and probably about to do less well,
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.660]   and buying assets that have probably done less well
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.420]   on average and about to do better.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.340]   And it's amazing.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.700]   And if we didn't have that rebalancing effect,
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.140]   we wouldn't be anywhere near 5%.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.980]   It'd probably be 1, 1.5% less.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.500]   Then it would make sense to take out 3%, maybe, yeah.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.220]   - So here's a good introductory question
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.540]   that asks a little bit more
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.940]   about sustainable distributions and retirement,
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.100]   and that is how inflation is taken into account
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.820]   into spending from your portfolio.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.020]   So maybe since we've sort of skipped over that point,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.620]   I'll let you talk a little bit about
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.140]   how inflation is computed
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.300]   into the sustainable distribution rate.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.300]   - Yeah, in my models, I use the CPI from tables over time.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:09.180]   And we all know that that's a statistic
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.580]   that's widely available.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.460]   But each individual probably has their own inflation rate.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.500]   If you really want to get sophisticated,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.020]   you might want to do your forecast
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.500]   and a determination withdrawal rate
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.060]   based on your personal rate of inflation.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.500]   Some people might have lower,
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.260]   some people might have higher due to a lot of things.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.940]   Maybe some people, a mortgage is a big factor,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.180]   a fixed mortgage, and it might be lower inflation rate.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.660]   Some people might have very high medical costs,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.820]   and they're facing high medical insurance rates.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.980]   So yeah, inflation is very critical,
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.540]   and to a certain extent,
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.980]   it limits the applicability of my research
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.100]   because I'm using a standard figure
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.580]   which may not apply to everybody,
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.900]   but it's a starting point.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.620]   - And at the risk of maybe answering this question too,
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.300]   basically, but I want to make sure that it does get answered,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.060]   we are going to assume that inflation
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.580]   is built into every successive year distribution.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.980]   That's to say, if you've got a million dollar portfolio,
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.540]   let's say you're targeting 4%,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.180]   first year you're going to take out 40,000,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.740]   next year it's going to be 40,000
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.940]   plus whatever inflation is for that year.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.700]   All right, if I am retiring right now,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.900]   what spending percentage do you suggest?
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.020]   - That's a great question.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.500]   Because I have this method
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.660]   where I use the current stock value evaluation,
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.540]   which is very high.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.140]   By anything I look, whether you use the Shiller CAPE
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.140]   or you use Warren Buffett's stock market value to GDP.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:45.300]   And inflation is what you would call moderate,
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.100]   pretty close to the historical average of about 3%.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.780]   And quite frankly,
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.340]   there is nothing in the historical record
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.060]   that really compares to this current situation.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.260]   So I'm kind of on the horns of a dilemma
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.780]   being a historical researcher.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.660]   So my instinct, if I was recommending to a person,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.380]   I'd say, I don't think we're in a worst case situation.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.060]   I don't think we're anywhere near
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.660]   what happened in the 1970s where inflation was raging
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.100]   and stock market valuations were in the '60s were high
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.620]   and they came down quite a bit.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:27.660]   But I would say if I'm recommending 5%
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.700]   as being a worst case, maybe 5.5%.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.500]   In fact, 5.5% for the one,
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.860]   the individual retired in July of 2001,
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.980]   which is not a great time to retire
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.780]   'cause he ran into a huge bear market.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.940]   You all remember the dot-com bust.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.940]   That was, that retiree with 24 years of data,
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   I think would have been able to withdraw 5.5%
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.780]   from a tax deferred account.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.780]   The 2007 retiree before that 58% monster in 2007,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   not 5.25%, so I suspect we're probably in that class
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.740]   given the valuations we're at
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.660]   and the inflation level we're at.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.900]   Somewhere in the 5.25, 5.5% range would make sense to me.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.340]   I don't think you need to go all the way down to five.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.460]   - Okay.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.180]   Yeah, one thing that really strikes me
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.500]   about using any sort of valuation metrics
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.100]   is that you just never know where valuations
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.820]   are gonna go in the future.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.820]   I think about a paper I did on doing dollar cost averaging.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.380]   Yes or no, in light of valuations,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.540]   the only conclusion I found is that,
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.460]   yes, you can do that.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.500]   You can do a dollar cost averaging or lump sum investing
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.140]   given what valuations may be at the time,
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.220]   but there's no guarantee
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220]   that high valuations won't go higher.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.060]   - That's true.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.380]   They've done that in the past.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.820]   No question.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.360]   - Certainly one wrinkle in investing.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.900]   - All right, what are your thoughts
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.980]   on some alternative withdrawal strategies?
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.900]   - Yeah, I've studied a number of those.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.780]   I've looked at something called
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.860]   what I call a percentage of portfolio value
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.860]   where you basically take 5% of whatever your portfolio value
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.340]   is at the start of the year.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.740]   That's a very popular concept
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.380]   because when I first did my research,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.140]   a lot of people thought that was how the 4% rule worked.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.860]   You know, you would take 5% of every year
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.460]   and it took a while to get people understand.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.700]   No, we kind of work more like social security,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.020]   you know, where we're taking a figure
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.060]   and then giving ourselves a cola.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.700]   But in this method, we're taking a percentage 5%,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.980]   let's say the portfolio each year.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.580]   That works in some cases,
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.300]   if you're lucky enough to retire into a big bull market
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.000]   and it fails miserably in other cases.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.980]   It's true, you'll never run out of money
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   'cause you're taking a percentage.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.260]   But, you know, if your portfolio drops to $1 in value,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.460]   you're gonna get 20 cents for your next year withdrawal.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.620]   That probably doesn't cut it for most folks,
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.580]   my understanding.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.240]   So that's not an exciting option.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.420]   I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.380]   Another option I've studied closely
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:18.380]   is what I call the cliff method,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.260]   where basically a retiree says,
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.020]   "Look, for the first 10 years of my retirement,
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.800]   "I'm gonna do a lot more traveling,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.080]   "a lot of other exciting stuff.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080]   "I need more money.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.580]   "So I wanna take above the safe withdrawal rate
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.460]   "in my early years.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.980]   "And then I wanna cut back after 10 years.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.800]   "I have the discipline to cut back to whatever it takes
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.100]   "to put me back on the safe path."
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.980]   And that works just fine.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.460]   You just have to recognize that the cliff
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.140]   going from the beginning, end of the 10th year
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.620]   into the 11th can be pretty steep.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.220]   And the friskier you get with your expenses
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.660]   early in retirement, if you say,
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.880]   "I wanna take 15 or 20% more on the safe level,"
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.760]   the bigger that cliff is, it might be 30, 35% or more.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.080]   It can work.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.280]   You have to run the numbers
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.640]   and make sure you understand well ahead of time,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.500]   this is what you'll be facing,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.280]   and this is how you will have to need to operate
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.340]   and be realistic with yourself.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.660]   But there's no reason that can't work.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.880]   I've looked at fixed annuity withdrawal rates
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.060]   with a little bit over 5%.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.880]   And there are other variations.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.960]   I'm still, there always seems to be something new,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.480]   exciting for me to study.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.080]   That's why I'm still doing this after 30 years,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.600]   is people come up with ideas,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.840]   they come up with a smile kind of a way.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.820]   You start with a high level of expenses
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.280]   and they decline your retirement,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.440]   then they actually go up.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.760]   I haven't looked at that in detail,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.940]   so I can't give you an answer,
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.040]   but I'll be doing that soon.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.000]   - I'm looking forward to it.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.360]   - All right, it's an interesting question.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.040]   Some folks want to preserve the real value
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.260]   of their assets for the next generation, right?
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.400]   So given that, how would that change the withdrawal rate?
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.360]   What would be a sustainable withdrawal rate
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.040]   to preserve the real principle of their portfolio?
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.800]   - Okay, they want to retain 100%
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.060]   of the real value of their portfolio.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.200]   You can do that,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   and that's one of the eight factors I looked at,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.300]   which is what I call legacy.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.520]   Do you want to leave money to your heirs?
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   Because in my original research,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.840]   I assumed that with your last dying breath,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.440]   after 30 years, you were going to go to a zero balance.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.960]   And most of us don't have that kind of timing,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.580]   quite frankly, to figure that good.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.420]   I don't know if I will,
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.280]   but it does sound highly improbable,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.600]   which is I recommend people probably
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.360]   select a time planning horizon
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.280]   that's at least 10 years longer
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.360]   than they actually think that lives.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.160]   But all the plans that I develop,
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   eventually end up running to 100% withdrawal rate
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.040]   at the end with a zero balance.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.720]   If you specify that you want to have a balance,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.840]   I've looked at those, it'll be in the book,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.480]   have a chart showing, depending upon how much value
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.360]   you want left in your portfolio
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.920]   at the end of your retirement,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.320]   to keep 100% of your portfolio value
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.360]   really a steep cut in withdrawal rate.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.920]   We're looking like going from 5% down
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360]   probably into the twos somewhere.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.200]   So it's steep.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.280]   It can be done once again, you know?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.840]   - Yeah, that certainly sounds right.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.680]   All right.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.800]   All right, if I plan to retire in a country
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.080]   other than the US, what sort of safe withdrawal rate
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.520]   should I plan to use?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.160]   - Oh, I think you can do 19%, no problem.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.320]   You know, that's a tough question
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.640]   'cause I've been focusing primarily on US investors.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.760]   I'm not xenophobic, it's just that
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.360]   there's so much work just in that area for me.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.120]   I know Wade Fowler's done some work in that area
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.200]   and he's determined that the withdrawal rates
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.640]   would probably be lesser 'cause we've been fortunate.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.520]   You know, United States investors
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.160]   have had a great stock market
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.520]   and access to those kinds of investments for a long time.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   Not everyone has stock markets that perform as well
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.560]   or has access to those kinds of investments.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.920]   So for me, that's a really tough question to answer.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.840]   I'm gonna beg out on that if you don't mind.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.000]   - Yeah, no, that's fine.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.320]   You know, I think another way I look at this question
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.560]   isn't necessarily that I'm going to be
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.960]   investing internationally so much as I'm
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.000]   perhaps investing domestically but living abroad, right?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.960]   And so that's a scenario.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.880]   If you look at exchange rates and what the inflation--
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   - Local tax rates and so forth,
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.560]   yeah, what kind of account you have, yeah.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.160]   - Yeah, what the inflation would be in that other country.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.000]   All right.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.640]   Isn't it a disadvantage to rebalance
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.020]   given the recognition of taxes?
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:08.860]   - Well, obviously rebalancing,
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.600]   if you're using a taxable account
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.640]   and you're selling investments to rebalance,
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.060]   there'll be some consequence of that.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:21.280]   But the importance of rebalancing is so great.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.920]   It adds so much value to the portfolio and your withdrawal rate.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.600]   It overwhelms tax considerations in the computations I do.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.400]   I look at that once again in the book.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.760]   I look at different rebalancing periods.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.920]   I found six to 12 as optimal,
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.760]   but there have been years where you could go 30 years
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.160]   without rebalancing and end up with a higher withdrawal rate.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.020]   It's very, very, it's unique.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.960]   There aren't too many situations like that.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.120]   They're all over the map.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.920]   I just wouldn't count on you retiring
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.440]   into a period like that.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.280]   I think the standard of practice of one year rebalancing
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   or slightly less, I pretty well agree with based on my data.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.200]   - All right, we have another case study question.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   If I want to assume inflation is 3%, I'm 73 years old,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.240]   what would be a safe withdrawal rate?
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.720]   - And what's the age?
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.840]   - 73.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.680]   - Okay.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.560]   I don't know.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.080]   My research doesn't assume
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.720]   a particular inflation rate will be in the future.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.560]   We don't know.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.640]   It's based on what's happened historically
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.800]   with a wide range of inflation rates.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.000]   I mean, someone could do a calculation
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   on a spreadsheet with that,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.400]   but it's dangerous because if you're looking
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.280]   over a 30-year period, who knows what inflation will be?
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.360]   Who knows what returns will be?
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.920]   Who knows what the economic environment will be?
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.840]   We could get an answer to that question
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.360]   and it'd probably be, you know,
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.000]   but it'd be using today's inflation regime,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.800]   today's stock market valuations
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.320]   because that we know fairly certainly.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:16.560]   That question really is one for Nostradamus, not for me.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.960]   - Yeah, certainly to your point,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.320]   at least with respect to assuming living 10 years longer
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:29.520]   than you would guess, using 30-year data, 73-year-old,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.120]   that could be a relatively conservative way
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.320]   to look at that.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.280]   All right, here's a fun one.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.880]   What method of withdrawal you use for your own retirement?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.640]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.760]   I retired in 2013 and at that time,
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.640]   four and a half percent was the worst case.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.400]   So I said, let's do the worst case, you know,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.720]   and I've been fortunate that I retired
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   into a nice bull market that's gone on for a number of years.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.920]   So if you look at my current withdrawal rate,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.360]   you can calculate,
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.160]   it's quite a bit less than four and a half percent now.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.080]   So I'm a very happy person, you know,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.880]   in that regard, it's worked out nicely.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.160]   I still think we got some kind of ugly bear market
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.920]   lurking somewhere in the not so distant future,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.160]   but things have gone well enough here the first 10 years
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.720]   that, you know, midterm bear markets
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.520]   are not as devastating as an early bear market, you know.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   - Yeah, and given that you've had so much success
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.560]   investing early on in your retirement
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.920]   and that's where all the risk is,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.080]   it's the beginning of retirement,
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.600]   it's that sequence risk,
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   have you adjusted your distribution rate?
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.320]   Have you increased it given the lucky outset
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.200]   of your retirement investing experience?
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.320]   - Well, you know, what I try to do,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.200]   I haven't actually made much adjustments,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.400]   but I've tried to increase the amount of money
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.880]   I give my children.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.400]   That's why, you know, some people will say
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.720]   your expenses will go down in retirement.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.160]   I haven't seen that because I treat my gifting
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.360]   to my children as an expense.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.160]   And so I keep that up as high as it is.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.880]   It keeps my expenses basically growing
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.240]   pretty much with inflation on a steady basis.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.520]   - Now that bond yields are higher,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.840]   how has that impacted your research?
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.680]   What does that mean for sustainable spending
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.080]   now that bonds are paying higher interest rates?
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.800]   - Well, I'm glad to see them there.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.240]   You know, for years we had the TINA condition.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.040]   There are no alternative to stocks,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.280]   which was absolutely nuts.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.320]   Now there is an alternative,
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.960]   and we're approaching more closely
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.360]   to an historically average situation.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.680]   So I'd say, since I'm a historical researcher,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.080]   it increases my confidence in my current forecast,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.680]   you know, using my methodology.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.920]   It's good to see.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.720]   We'll see what happens, you know,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.400]   to bond yields in coming years.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.920]   Summer forecast in the 10 year
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.840]   could go down into the twos again.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.680]   I don't know.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.840]   Once again, that's not my job to forecast the future.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.080]   I have a hard enough time studying the past.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.520]   But it's reassuring to get back there
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.320]   to a more normal situation.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.720]   Another interesting case study.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   What if you're retiring into ongoing health issues?
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.440]   Any thoughts or recommendations in that situation?
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.680]   - Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.080]   - Oh, retiring with ongoing health issues.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.040]   So I'm assuming lots of high medical expenses.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.880]   - Sure.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.280]   - How does that impact distribution planning in retirement?
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.160]   - Well, it means your expenses potentially,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.760]   you're going to then,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.840]   it's really a budgeting scene more of a drawl issue.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.920]   I mean, my job is to figure out the most
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   you can get out of your retirement accounts safely,
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   you know, without taking unnecessary risk.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.520]   If you have an unusual situation in terms of your expenses,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.160]   that's going to have to be dealt pretty much
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.320]   on the expense side,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.520]   because portfolio can only stand so much,
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.680]   no matter what your physical condition is, you know.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.000]   Portfolio doesn't care.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.120]   It's going to do what it's going to do.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   And hopefully, closely follow historical, you know,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.000]   patterns.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.720]   - Yeah, it's really an issue of how terminal, right,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.560]   the health issue is.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.040]   Is it something that's chronic on ongoing?
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.280]   Am I going to have those expenses for a long time?
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.760]   Or is it going to be more short-lived and very expensive?
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.600]   - That's right.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.960]   And then it becomes a planning horizon issue.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.480]   - This question also from Boglehead's Reddit,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.280]   from username Buffanita.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.840]   This one asks about if retirement is a long time away
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.160]   for them in the future,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.240]   what sort of thoughts or considerations
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.560]   should they be giving to the research
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.200]   that they're coming across now
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.320]   versus weighing that against future research?
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   How seriously should they take the 4% rule,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.080]   the Trinity study, et cetera,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.920]   for something that may come out
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.000]   when they actually are ready to retire?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.680]   - So that's an interesting situation
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.600]   where people perhaps with 30 years to retirement
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.000]   are wondering whether or not the research I've done
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.240]   will still be applicable in the future.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.800]   That's really a very tough question to answer.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.320]   To a certain extent,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.760]   there are a lot of underlying assumptions to my research,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.040]   is one is that markets will behave pretty much the same
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.520]   as they have in the past,
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.640]   that the U.S. economy will behave
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.360]   pretty much as it has in the past.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.640]   I've seen some people who feel
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.560]   that the U.S. growth rate, the GDP,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.400]   well, there we are, that was not predictable.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.600]   - I guess that was our five-minute warning.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.640]   - As usual, I find myself in the dark,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.360]   and that does raise a lot of tough questions
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.640]   that I don't know how to answer
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.240]   other than I suspect the United States
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.800]   will continue to be a powerful engine of growth
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.640]   for a long time into the future,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.720]   and that we may slow down a little bit our growth rate
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.600]   for demographic reasons or for other considerations,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.120]   but I wouldn't necessarily have a pessimistic view
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   about the future, at least neutral,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.440]   and I think it's even happier to be optimistic,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.120]   so I'd be an optimist.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.360]   - Yeah, I think with respect to considering your research,
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.840]   looking at what has worked in the past
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.280]   for spending sustainably in retirement,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.880]   that worst case, October '68,
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.600]   that period of high inflation,
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.200]   that's where we get that 4% guideline,
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.800]   so if there is worse performance over the next 30 years,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.840]   that was just a lower level of spending than that,
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.480]   but absent that, 4% would still,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.600]   or 4% higher given the additional other asset classes.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.160]   - Yeah, and you know, it's possible.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.560]   I'm never gonna claim that the current levels,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.520]   historical precedents, are gonna last forever,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.560]   'cause we know they haven't,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.400]   because they changed in 1968.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.320]   Prior to 1968, there was a higher withdrawal rate,
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.280]   you know, it would've been,
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.720]   and if you look at the very start,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.520]   you know, 1926, it was around 5 3/4, 6%,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.640]   and then the Great Depression brought that down,
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.880]   and then World War II, and things,
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.640]   and so gradually, we went from like about 6%
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   down to about 5%, and it could happen.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.680]   We could enter a period of history
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.920]   where some terrible things could happen,
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.600]   and you'll end up with a new worst case scenario.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.280]   I fully admit that, but I had, you know,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.240]   this current one's lasted for 50 years,
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.760]   which is the longest time any withdrawal,
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.000]   worst case withdrawal rate has lasted in the last 100,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.680]   so hopefully we get a few more years out of it, decades.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.480]   - Yeah, we'll certainly know 30 years from now.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.800]   - Yeah.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.640]   - All right.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.440]   What role did dividends play in your research?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.320]   - I don't specifically isolate dividends.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   You know, basically, my research is based
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.600]   on a total return basis,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.760]   where your portfolio earns interest, and dividends,
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.640]   and capital appreciation, and if it's a taxable portfolio,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.240]   you know, we're gonna tax them differently,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.080]   but if it's a tax-deferred portfolio,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   they're all kind of lumped together,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.000]   and just basically grows your portfolio
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.360]   on a total basis.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:43.080]   I know some folks like high-dividend stocks,
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.800]   and from the perspective of my research,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.400]   it really doesn't make too much difference,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.440]   but I can see a positive.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.880]   The hardest thing when you establish an investment plan
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   is sticking with it,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.480]   particularly when the big bear market comes,
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.800]   and if dividend-paying stocks continue
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.840]   to pay good dividends, they're a bear market,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.200]   and give an investor a sense of security,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.760]   and less panic, because they're still earning some dividend.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.480]   I think that's a plus for that particular strategy.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.800]   If it can keep you on your plan, you know, I'd go for it.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.920]   - We've got a couple minutes left.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.600]   Tell us about some of the newer asset classes
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.120]   that you've added to your research.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.160]   Certainly, we started with the S&P 500,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.680]   intermediary from treasuries.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.800]   What are those other asset classes that you shunned?
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.240]   - Yeah, I started out with, of course,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.400]   just two asset classes, U.S. large-cap stocks,
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.600]   and U.S. intermediate-term government bonds,
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.000]   and I added 2006, I added U.S. small-cap stocks,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   and then I added, and recently, several years ago,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.480]   I added international stocks,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.880]   I added U.S. micro-cap stocks, U.S. mid-cap stocks,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.680]   and treasury bills as a cash surrogate.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   And I wonder, and those, of course, elevated the portfolio.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   I suspect, you know, because I didn't get that large a bump
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.640]   when I added those four asset classes recently,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.240]   they were probably approaching diminishing returns.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.440]   There are other asset classes that we could use.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.880]   We could use REITs, commodities, we could use gold,
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.000]   alternatives, I suspect, though,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   that the correlations between the assets
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.480]   are gonna become more difficult to be advantageous
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.240]   in that you're gonna find that we may get 5.1, 5.2,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.480]   but we're probably getting pretty close to the limits
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.560]   of what we can get with a diversified portfolio.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.360]   - Did each of those sub-asset classes
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.280]   add to the distribution rate?
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.800]   - I didn't, you know, that's an interesting question.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.200]   I didn't try to add them one at a time
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.280]   and see what the effect was.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.080]   I added them as a lump, you know,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.840]   'cause I was trying to replicate
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.280]   what most investors would use,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.520]   a well-diversified portfolio.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.360]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.520]   - Yeah, I wonder if bills were a little bit of a drag.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.360]   - Yeah.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.400]   I'll add that to my list, though.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.440]   Thank you, John.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.600]   One more thing to do.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.480]   - Happy to add to your list.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.080]   Well, folks, that is gonna be it.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.040]   That is the end of our interview with Bill Bang,
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.760]   and he will be returning in a couple hours
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.160]   to rumble with Christine Benz and Carson Jeske
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.040]   for our withdrawal rate rumble in a couple hours.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.000]   Back here in the big room when we merge it all together.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.200]   We'll see you there soon.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.040]   - Knives out.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.840]   - Thank you all.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.060]   you
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.120]   you
