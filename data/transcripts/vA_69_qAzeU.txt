[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.320]   - Folks, my name is John Luskin.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   You may remember me from such shows as Bogleheads Live
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.520]   and doing a brief stint on the
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.200]   Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   Today, I am here to, once again, interview Bill Bangen.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.960]   I previously interviewed Bill on episode 35
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.600]   of the Bogleheads Live show.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   If you guys wanna check that out, go to bogelcenter.net.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800]   And if you like what you hear,

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.780]   Let me introduce a man that needs no introduction.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.640]   Bill Bangen received his BS from MIT
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.860]   in aerospace engineering.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.000]   He's had four careers,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.520]   including his third in fee-only financial planning,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.280]   where in the early '90s,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.240]   in an attempt to answer questions from clients,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.760]   he began his research on sustainable spending in retirement
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   leading to the 4% rule of thumb that we all know today.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960]   Bill, welcome to the 2024 Bogleheads Conference.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.800]   - Yeah, thanks.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.380]   I appreciate the invitation.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.800]   - Folks, I am gonna start asking Bill some questions
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   that I got beforehand from the Bogleheads communities online
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.720]   but if you have a question,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.240]   go ahead, get a pen, some paper, write it down.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.720]   And then Karen is gonna be going around
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.080]   collecting the questions.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   There she is.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.320]   Fantastic.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.240]   So let's start with the basics.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   Tell us about the 4% rule.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.400]   What is it?
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.500]   - I have no idea, quite frankly.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.240]   We're really talking about something
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.760]   that technically doesn't exist,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   or at least I never created it.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.320]   I did a paper in '94, October,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.160]   it's almost 30 years ago, next month,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.600]   in which I took a very preliminary look
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   at what kind of withdrawal rate,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   safe withdrawal rate retirees
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.480]   could use under the worst conditions,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.240]   worst case conditions.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.400]   And that turned out to be 4.15%.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.960]   And I just put that paper out there.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.880]   And I wrote other papers, but they kind of got ignored
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   and people focused on that first paper
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   and they approximated the 4.15% to 4%,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800]   and then they went further and said,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   "Well, that's a rule we can all follow."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.120]   Which I never said because my belief as a financial advisor,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.840]   every individual, every client
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.400]   has unique needs in retirement.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.600]   And the process for getting to a quote number
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   is a lot more complicated
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.240]   than using just a simple one size fits all rule.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.280]   - Wonderful.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.400]   Tell us about some of your more recent research.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720]   What have you found continuing to research this subject?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   How has the answer changed?
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.160]   - Okay, well, now we have, I think,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.080]   the 5% rule, if you will. (laughs)
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.240]   I've been, over time,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.200]   I've been making my research more sophisticated.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.440]   I've been adding ACID classes.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.920]   My first paper used only two ACID classes,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.440]   which is hardly a diversified portfolio.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.400]   When I added small caps in 2006,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.760]   just one more ACID class,
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.080]   it went from 4.15% to four and a half,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   which was a nice jump,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.800]   but that's still a long way from a diversified portfolio.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   And more recently, I used seven ACID classes,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.160]   adding mid caps and international stock, micro caps.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.880]   And when I did that, I got up to just about 4.7%.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   Once again, this is for the worst case scenario.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.800]   Yeah, I studied 400 retirees
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560]   retiring on the first date of each quarter,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   beginning in January 1st, 1926.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.040]   So there's almost 400, 100 years of data there.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.520]   And only one of those 400 individuals
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.000]   was constrained with that low worst case rate.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.360]   Everyone else was higher.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   Most were quite a bit higher.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.080]   The average for all retirees
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.680]   across that 100-year period is 7%.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.480]   If you want to have a rule, you ought to use a 7% rule.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.800]   Although for the last 25 years,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.360]   I've not been able to find a retiree who was average.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   It's because of the high valuations in the stock market.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   We've been toward the lower end of the spectrum,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.320]   but still, you know, above 5%, in my opinion.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.880]   - That's a great segue into another question
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.080]   related to what we had to find from the community.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.040]   Given that valuations are high,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.080]   what impact do valuations have
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.240]   on sustainable spending in retirement?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.600]   - Okay, that's really an interesting question.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.400]   And that leads into the conclusion
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   I reached early in my research,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   which everybody knows,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.160]   that if you run into a major bear market in stocks
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.480]   early in retirement, it damages your portfolio,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.240]   and therefore will reduce your retirement withdrawal rate.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   And to get to that point
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   where you have a major bear market early in retirement,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.200]   they almost all occur from periods of high valuation.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   But stock markets rarely collapse
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.200]   when they have a P/E of 10 or 12 or something like that.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.480]   Almost all the major bear markets in history
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.000]   have come from much higher.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.920]   And we certainly know that in this century.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.440]   And in 2008, a colleague of mine, Michael Kitsies,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.360]   who you probably know, a brilliant guy,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.720]   published a paper, actually in his newsletter,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.160]   and a wonderful chart in which he tracked
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.480]   stock market valuations year by year since 1926,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.400]   even back further, against the withdrawal rate
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.640]   that would have applied to that particular year.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.760]   And it's an amazing chart because it shows
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.320]   that withdrawal rates and stock market valuation
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.200]   move in opposite directions, which you kind of expect.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.160]   In other words, the more expensive the stock market is
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.040]   early in retirement, the more likely you are
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   to have a bear market and the lower the withdrawal rate.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.080]   However, if you were fortunate enough to retire
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   at a time of really low stock market valuations,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.320]   you would be able to take quite a bit more,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.680]   quite a bit above average.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.920]   And when I saw that chart, I nearly jumped out of my chair.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.160]   I remember the moment, opening that publication,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.480]   looking and saying, my gosh, this is the answer.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.320]   Because up to that point, what guidance
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.200]   could I have given my clients to decide
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.480]   what their withdrawal rate would be?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.960]   That was a real issue in the early years.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.880]   I could draw a chart, I could count the number of retirees,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   let's say, who could retire successfully at 4.5%.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.640]   That was 100%, let's say, in my earlier research.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.280]   And then if I increased the withdrawal rate to 5%,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.120]   maybe 95% of the people would have been able
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.760]   to successfully negotiate retirement.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.640]   Then I went to 5.5%, maybe it was 90,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.120]   and I go through the whole list.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   And so I have a chart which basically assigned
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.120]   to each withdrawal rate, up to 10, 12, 13%,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.880]   the probability, based on history,
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.720]   that you would have been able to successfully withdraw.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.760]   The problem is with that, how does an individual choose
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   what's the appropriate probability for them to use?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.120]   What criteria, I always felt when I gave a client
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   this chart and said, here it is,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.760]   you can figure out the probability, I don't have a clue.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.480]   It was kind of like sending them off to Vegas
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.520]   with one of those blackjack charts,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.480]   where it kind of says, hold on 17,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   and get hit on 16, and split eights,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.720]   and take insurance, and do this.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.840]   So I felt very uncomfortable with that whole issue.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.400]   And really, particularly uncomfortable
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.520]   because it's at the very beginning of the process.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.080]   If you're developing a plan for your withdrawals,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.040]   that's one of the first issues you wanna take a look at.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.720]   And it wasn't until three summers ago,
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.560]   actually, 27 years into my research,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.840]   that I found what I call a missing link,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.920]   which is inflation.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.440]   I knew inflation had to be a factor,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.840]   'cause we know stock market, bear markets,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.320]   are really powerful determinants of withdrawal rates,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.880]   but the correlation is not close enough
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.400]   to confidently predict what the withdrawal rate should be,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.320]   based upon the stock market valuation.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.000]   There's just too much slosh,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.120]   it's maybe only a 75% correlation.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   I needed higher, and I used to sit, and look, and think,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.920]   and drive myself crazy, and say,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.400]   no, inflation is in there somewhere,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.160]   but I keep drawing charts of stock market valuation,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   and I put down the inflation rates associated with it,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.000]   and it's a messy chart.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.720]   I don't see a pattern.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.680]   And then I remember one summer morning,
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.440]   I got up early, and I was just thinking about this problem,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.520]   and I just had this flash.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.880]   I said, wow, what if instead of treating withdrawal
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.040]   of the stock market valuation first,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.440]   why don't we make inflation the most important factor?
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.560]   Very powerful, because you have to increase withdrawal rates,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.440]   they're gonna get stuck at this higher level
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.240]   for the rest of retirement.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   So what I did was create six inflation regimes,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   three in the inflation side,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.520]   moderate, low, and high inflation,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.120]   three on the deflation side,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.320]   moderate, low, and high deflation,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.120]   and then put the stock market valuation within them,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.640]   and see what, and the chart was beautiful.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.520]   So I was able to, from that, create a chart,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.200]   starting with the inflation regime you think you're in,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.720]   and within it, list the stock market valuations,
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.520]   Shiller CAPE, and that gave me a tool
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   that's about 85 to 90% correlation.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.200]   That gave me the confidence to say,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.440]   I can now, somebody comes to me and tells me
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.920]   when they retire, the stock market's valued this high,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.160]   and on top of it, we have the inflation rate we know,
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.600]   I can suggest now a withdrawal rate,
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.520]   which might not be the worst case.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   It might be five, might be six, might be seven,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.920]   might be 10, if we get lucky
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.320]   and we get a low stock market valuation.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.200]   So finally, that problem, for the first time after,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.720]   I'm sorry it took 27 years, folks, to get that done,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.760]   but it looks like I've got a solution to that problem there.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.160]   - Wonderful.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.240]   Let's geek out a little bit on the numbers
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.720]   as we're all investment fans here.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.600]   Let's talk about some of the data
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   and some of the approach that you used.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   So we got a question here that asks
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.080]   about how fees show up in a distribution rate.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.880]   So certainly, if we're using a low-cost index fund,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.520]   that's gonna be easy 'cause it's gonna have
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   a very small effect on how much we're spending.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.680]   Has your research looked at the different fees
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.960]   in the various indices that you've used?
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.400]   For example, small-cap funds,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   those might be more expensive to trade given illiquidity.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.960]   Has that shown up in your research
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   as well as, relatedly, a question here about advisor fees?
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.280]   What work could be done on fees
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.760]   and how that impacts portfolio distribution rates?
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   - Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.400]   In my research, I don't concern myself with fees.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.840]   I'm assuming today, at least as far as funds,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.360]   using fund investments, what I assume I'm using
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.800]   in my research, that there will be none.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   And we've practically come to that point.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.280]   There are no commissions, really, on trades anymore.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.080]   We're in a commissioned environment.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.360]   When I first did my research 30 years ago,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.480]   if you'd asked me that question,
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.080]   I might have been a little bit embarrassed
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.400]   because, wow, they were still a factor.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.920]   But not anymore.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.520]   The advisor fees are, though,
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.440]   and I had a friend some years ago did a study of that.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.920]   If you have advisor fees of 1%, 1.25%,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.120]   they're a significant factor.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.760]   But I don't take them into consideration
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.520]   for the simple reason that they vary so much
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.720]   from individual to individual.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.400]   I can't give a consistent result.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.240]   And what I suggest is that people,
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.000]   when you do your budget for retirement,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.640]   your expense budget, that is an expense item
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.240]   and it's different for everyone.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.480]   But actually, it has to be taken into account.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.760]   - All right.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   And folks, if you have a question, write it down.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   Karen will collect it and then she'll bring it up here
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.320]   and we can ask Bill Bangor your question.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.160]   Let's jump to some other questions
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.000]   we got from the Bogleheads community beforehand.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.880]   This one comes from Fender Strat Guy
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.760]   from Bogleheads Reddit.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   Shout out to Bogleheads Reddit, by the way.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.840]   They ask some great questions.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.560]   He wants to know what your thoughts are
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   on your research, which looks at historical data
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.480]   versus a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.960]   - Yeah.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.720]   Theoretically, they should both give similar results
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.200]   and I think they do.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.640]   I'm kind of anomaly.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.600]   I don't think too many do the way
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.280]   I'm looking at it myself right now.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.800]   Most people are using Monte Carlo simulations.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.760]   They're both legitimate approaches.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.640]   I just feel comfortable using historical data
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.800]   because I kind of enjoy talking to people about,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.360]   hey, 1947 there, we had an inflation outbreak
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.920]   and it affected the withdrawal rate, or 1962.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   Some people can relate, I think, a lot easier
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.720]   to actual historical periods they may have lived through
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.680]   to thousands of anonymous trials.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.600]   But as a technical tool, it's perfectly valid.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.840]   A lot of people do their research, I respect it.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.880]   And fortunately, we come up something fairly close.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.600]   - And for those who aren't super investment nerds,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.080]   as you may already know,
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.880]   it probably doesn't need much explanation,
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.840]   Bill's research looks at what has happened in the past,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.040]   what could I have spent in the past from my portfolio.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.880]   Monte Carlo simulation, we're gonna tell a computer,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   hey, this is what investment returns were.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.280]   Now I want you to make up what investment returns
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.720]   are gonna be in the future
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   and then do that maybe 1,000 or 10,000 times.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.120]   How many of those times did the particular situation
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.640]   run out of money or have enough?
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.520]   And that's gonna be a success rate,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.720]   that is a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.120]   Christine Benz, who we'll get to chat with later,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.800]   she used that in doing her research
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.000]   on sustainable spending in retirement.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.120]   - Can I make just a brief comment?
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.600]   - Yeah, no, please. - Out of the blue.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.680]   I'm just curious, this conference is named
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.000]   after John Bogle, a great man.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.280]   I'm just curious how many out in the audience
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.880]   might have had a fortune enough
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.680]   to have met Mr. Bogle at some time?
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.600]   Not too many.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.280]   I just wanna say it's a privilege
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.880]   to be at a conference named after him.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.680]   I did meet him once.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.720]   It was in my early years as an advisor,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.160]   early '90s, I think.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.080]   I got asked to join what Vanguard
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.000]   called their advisory council.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.240]   And twice a year, we'd fly out to Valley Forge
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   and we'd meet with the executives at Vanguard
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.320]   and we'd talk about items of mutual interest.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.160]   And one year, Mr. Bogle came out to talk with us.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   And Mr. Bogle was my hero and still is a hero for me.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.720]   He was an extraordinary individual
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.680]   and a very imposing individual.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.600]   He was big and big-boned and he had this magnificent voice.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   I mean, he probably could have put James Earl Jones
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.240]   out of businesses, Darth Vader, if he wanted to.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   He was powerful.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.720]   But he was also a very kind man.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.840]   And he answered my ignorant early year questions
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.600]   as an advisor with great consideration.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.760]   And I just think it's wonderful
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   you've named this organization as a conference after him
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   because he is deserving, in my opinion,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.200]   he was a titan and still is a titan of the financial world.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.280]   So privileged to speak at a conference named after him.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.120]   - Wonderful.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.440]   Yes, okay, great.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.000]   Thank you, Karen.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.960]   All right, let's jump to another question
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.560]   from the Bogle Heads community that we got from beforehand.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.000]   This one is from Man of Clouds from Bogle Heads Reddit.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.160]   And he asks about, I have traditional 401(k),
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.320]   I've got a Roth IRA,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.280]   I've got a plain vanilla taxable account.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.240]   What should I be thinking about
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.200]   with respect to distributions for the 4% rule
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.800]   across these different types of accounts?
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.960]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.240]   I assume in my research
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.800]   that you're probably gonna have one primary account
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.840]   for which you're gonna withdraw during retirement.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.360]   And that's very important,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.440]   whether it's a taxable or tax deferred
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.280]   or tax advantage count.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.200]   There are different withdrawal rates for each one.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.920]   That's one of eight factors I looked at.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.680]   I'm just finishing up a book on this whole thing.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.840]   We're gonna take my whole 30 years of experience
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.440]   and put it out for the world to see.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.320]   And that's what I call one of the eight important elements
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.760]   to compute your withdrawal rate
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.440]   is knowing what type of account you have.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.600]   Withdrawal rates for taxable accounts
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.000]   are obviously less than they are
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.640]   for tax advantage accounts.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.320]   But it depends upon the tax rate.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.640]   In my book, I use what I call
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.960]   a computed average tax rate for your account.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.480]   Then I'll have a chart showing you
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.120]   what the withdrawal rate would be.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.960]   It could be 10% less, could be 20% less or more
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.600]   than for a tax deferred account.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.720]   - All right.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.760]   So let's talk about how does the 4% rule
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.720]   apply to early retirees,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.600]   folks who have a long retirement in front of them.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.360]   - Sure, this is one of the eight factors in,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.640]   which is planning horizon, essentially.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.520]   It's a very important issue.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.440]   The so-called 4% rule applies to 30 years.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.640]   For folks, let's say, who have very short retirements,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.080]   let's say 10 years, you could get up to 8% or 9%.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.840]   When you get to longer retirements,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.440]   which I know a lot of folks are very interested in,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.000]   40 years, 50 years or more,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.880]   the retirement rate, let's say we were at 5%,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.320]   starts to decline, but it kind of does so,
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.480]   somebody would use asymptotically,
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.720]   where it approaches a level of around 4.3%,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   and this is worst case scenario, we're talking once again,
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.520]   so that if you get out even 100 years, 150 years,
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   you're gonna be about 4.3% or so.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.760]   I don't know what the exact number is,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.200]   but it's pretty close to that.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.080]   So that, yes, the withdrawal rate is very sensitive
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.800]   to the time horizon that you use.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   - So what withdrawal rate would you suggest
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   for someone who has a long timeline in front of them?
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.320]   - What would I suggest, Jerry?
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.280]   Well, you know, I'd have to look at all the eight factors.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.080]   In addition, that's just one of the eight factors,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.920]   that's why I'm trying to get away
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   from the use of the term rule, 4% rule.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.400]   Oh, I must admit, I'm a complete hypocrite in that regard,
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.880]   'cause I recently changed my Arizona license plate
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.760]   to read Mr. 4%.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.920]   And part of the reason is because every time
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.520]   that I go to a hotel, park my car,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.920]   they ask me for the license plate,
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.000]   which I could never remember.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.800]   Now I can remember my license plate when they ask me.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.200]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.640]   Thoughts on 3% as a distribution rate for early retirees.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.480]   - I'm sorry?
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.760]   - Oh, what are your thoughts on a 3% distribution rate
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.880]   for early retirees?
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   - 3% seems unnecessarily penetrating.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   I think you're gonna find yourself late in retirement
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:20.040]   extremely wealthy with a lot of regret, in my opinion.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.720]   If you want to have a decent lifestyle,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.440]   I don't know why you would want to necessarily spend it all
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.800]   unless you're very fearful about something that I'm,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.640]   you know, I tend to be an optimist overall.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.760]   I think we'll get through our situations,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.400]   whatever we're facing, you know.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.760]   I think 3% is overdoing it a bit.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   I can't, you know, I run models.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.920]   When somebody asked me a question,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.920]   I said, well, what kind of combination of circumstances
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.040]   would it take to force somebody into a worst case 3%?
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.680]   It would take probably 20 years of 10% inflation
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.160]   and, you know, a 70% bear market.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.600]   And we haven't seen that coming.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.240]   I hope we don't, you know.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.400]   But that's kind of the thing it would take
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.120]   to force this into 3%, in my opinion, yeah.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.640]   - So in your research, you looked at,
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.960]   original research rather, you looked at large cap
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   and intermediate term treasuries for the portfolio.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.120]   This question asks, when you do pay yourself,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.920]   when you do make your distributions,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.400]   should you sell equally across both stocks and bonds?
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.320]   - Oh, rebalancing at the end of the year,
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.880]   which is another important factor.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.400]   Generally, you will be selling off the assets
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.000]   who have outperformed, whether they be stocks or bonds,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.760]   and, you know, then buying assets that have underperformed.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.680]   And that has a beautiful, rebalancing is just so important
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.000]   and doing that in a portfolio.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.640]   I have some illustrations in my book.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.320]   If you take a look at the seven ask classes I have
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.480]   and calculate an expected one-year return,
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.880]   I think you come out with around 8.5%, something like that.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.960]   But if you look at the portfolios run over 50-year periods,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.800]   compounding and rebalancing once a year,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.280]   they average 10% a year.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.240]   That extra return is generated
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.720]   by the benefits of rebalancing,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.600]   where you're naturally selling off assets
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.680]   that have done well and probably about to do less well,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.640]   and buying assets that have probably done less well
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.440]   than average and about to do better.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.360]   And it's amazing.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.720]   And if we didn't have that rebalancing effect,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.160]   we wouldn't be anywhere near 5%.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.000]   It'd probably be 1, 1.5% less.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.520]   Then it would make sense to take out 3%, maybe, yeah.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.240]   - So here's a good introductory question
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.560]   that asks a little bit more
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.920]   about sustainable distributions and retirement,
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   and that is how inflation is taken account
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.840]   into spending from your portfolio.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.040]   So maybe since we've sort of skipped over that point,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.080]   I'll let you talk a little bit
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.160]   about how inflation's computed
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.280]   into the sustainable distribution rate.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   - Yeah, in my models, I use the CPI from tables over time.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.160]   And we all know that that's a statistic
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.600]   that's widely available,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.480]   but each individual probably has their own inflation rate.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.520]   If you really wanna get sophisticated,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.040]   you might wanna do your forecast
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.520]   and a determination withdrawal rate
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.120]   based on your personal rate of inflation.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.560]   Some people might have lower.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.280]   Some people might have higher.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.360]   Due to a lot of things, maybe some people,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.080]   a mortgage is a big factor, a fixed mortgage in there,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   and it might be lower inflation rate.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.720]   Some people might have very high medical costs
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.880]   and they're facing high medical insurance rates.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.000]   So yeah, inflation is very critical.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.600]   And to a certain extent,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.040]   it limits the applicability of my research
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.160]   because I'm using a standard figure
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.560]   which may not apply to everybody,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.880]   but it's a starting point.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.640]   - And at the risk of maybe answering this question too,
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.320]   basically, but I wanna make sure that it does get answered,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.080]   we are gonna assume that inflation
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.600]   is built into every successive year distribution.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.960]   That's to say, if you've got a million dollar portfolio,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.520]   let's say you're targeting 4%.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   First year, you're gonna take out 40,000.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.720]   Next year, it's gonna be 40,000
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.920]   plus whatever inflation is for that year.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.680]   All right, if I am retiring right now,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.880]   what spending percentage do you suggest?
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.000]   - That's a great question.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.480]   Because I have this method
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.640]   where I use the current stock value evaluation,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.600]   which is very high by anything I look,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.120]   whether you use the Shiller CAPE
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   or you use Warren Buffet's stock market value to GDP.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:45.280]   And inflation is what you would call moderate,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.080]   pretty close to the historical average of about 3%.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   And quite frankly, there is nothing in the historical record
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.040]   really compares to this current situation.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.240]   So I'm kind of on the horns of a dilemma
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.760]   being a historical researcher.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.680]   So my instinct, if I was recommending to a person,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.400]   I'd say, I don't think we're in a worst case situation.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.080]   I don't think we're anywhere near
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.680]   what happened in the 1970s where inflation was raging
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.120]   and stock market valuations were in the '60s were high
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.680]   and they came down quite a bit.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   But I would say, if I'm recommending 5%
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   as being a worst case, maybe 5 1/2%.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   In fact, 5 1/2% for the individual retired in July of 2001,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.960]   which is not a great time to retire
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.120]   'cause he ran into a huge bear market.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.880]   We all remember the dot-com bust.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   That retiree with 24 years of data,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.920]   I think would have been able to withdraw 5 1/2%
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   from a tax deferred account.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   The 2007 retiree, before that, 58% monster.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   In 2007, it was now 5 1/4%.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.080]   So I suspect we're probably in that class
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.720]   given the valuations we're at
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.600]   and the inflation level we're at.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.640]   Somewhere in the 5 1/4, 5 1/2% range
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.840]   would make sense to me.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.320]   I don't think you need to go all the way down to five.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   - Okay.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.160]   Yeah, one thing that really strikes me
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.480]   about using any sort of valuation metrics
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.080]   is that you just never know where valuations
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.800]   are gonna go in the future.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   I think about a paper I did on doing dollar-cost averaging.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.320]   Yes or no in-light evaluations,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.520]   and one conclusion I found is that,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.440]   yes, you can do that.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.280]   You can do a dollar-cost averaging
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.920]   or lump-sum investing given what valuations
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.120]   might be at the time,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.480]   but there's no guarantee that high valuations
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.200]   won't go higher.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.040]   - That's true.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.320]   I've done that in the past.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.800]   No question.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.320]   - Certainly one wrinkle in investing.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.120]   All right.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.880]   What are your thoughts
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.960]   on some alternative withdrawal strategies?
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.880]   - Yeah, I've studied a number of those.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.760]   I've looked at something called
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.840]   what I call a percentage of portfolio value
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.320]   where you basically take 5%
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.000]   of whatever your portfolio value is
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.320]   at the start of the year.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.720]   That's a very popular concept
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.320]   because when I first did my research,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.080]   a lot of people thought that was how the 4% rule worked.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.800]   You know, you would take 5% of it every year,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.400]   and it took a while to get people to understand.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.640]   No, we kind of work more like Social Security,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   you know, where we're taking a figure
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.000]   and then giving ourselves a COLA,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   but in this method,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.640]   we're taking a percentage, 5%,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.920]   let's say, the portfolio each year.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.520]   That works in some cases
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.240]   if you're lucky enough to retire into a big bull market,
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.920]   and it fails miserably in other cases.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   It's true you'll never run out of money
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   'cause you're taking a percentage,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.200]   but, you know, if your portfolio drops to $1 in value,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.360]   you're gonna get 20 cents for your next year withdrawal.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.560]   That probably doesn't cut it for most folks,
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.520]   my understanding.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.160]   So that's not an exciting option.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.320]   I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.280]   Another option I've studied closely
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   is what I call the Cliff Method,
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.240]   where basically a retiree says,
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.960]   "Look, for the first 10 years of my retirement,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.720]   "I'm gonna do a lot more traveling,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.040]   "a lot of other exciting stuff.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   "I need more money,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.520]   "so I wanna take above the safe withdrawal rate
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.400]   "in my early years,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.920]   "and then I wanna cut back after 10 years.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.760]   "I have the discipline to cut back to whatever it takes
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.040]   "to put me back on the safe path."
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.920]   And that works just fine.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.400]   You just have to recognize that the cliff
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.800]   going from, you know, the beginning,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.560]   end of the 10th year into the 11th can be pretty steep.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.920]   And the friskier you get
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.200]   with your expenses early in retirement,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.880]   if you say I wanna take 15 or 20% more on the safe level,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.720]   the bigger that cliff is, it might be 30, 35% or more.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.280]   It can work, you have to run the numbers
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.640]   and make sure you understand well ahead of time,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.520]   this is what you'll be facing,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.280]   and this is how you will have to need to operate
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.360]   and be realistic with yourself.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.640]   But there's no reason that can't work.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.880]   I've looked at annuity, fixed annuity withdrawal rates,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   it's a little bit over 5%.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   And there are other variations.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.000]   I'm still, there's always seems to be something new,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.480]   exciting for me to study.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.080]   That's why I'm still doing this after 30 years
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.600]   is people come up with ideas,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.040]   they come up with a smile,
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.840]   kind of a way you start with a high level of expenses
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.280]   and they decline your retirement,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.440]   then they actually go up.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.760]   I haven't looked at that in detail,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.960]   so I can't give you an answer,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.600]   but I'll be doing that soon, you know.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   - I'm looking forward to it.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.360]   - All right, here's an interesting question.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.040]   Some folks wanna preserve the real value
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.240]   of their assets for the next generation, right?
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.400]   So given that, how would that change a withdrawal rate?
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.360]   What would be a sustainable withdrawal rate
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.040]   to preserve the real principle of their portfolio?
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.800]   - Okay, they wanna retain 100%
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.040]   of the real value of their portfolio.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.200]   You can do that,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   and that's one of the eight factors I looked at,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.320]   which is what I call legacy.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.520]   Do you wanna leave money to your heirs?
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   Because in my original research,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.920]   I assume that with your last dying breath after 30 years,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.480]   you were gonna go to a zero balance.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.000]   And most of us don't have that kind of timing,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.640]   quite frankly, to figure that good.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.480]   I don't know if I will,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.320]   but it does sound highly improbable,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.400]   which is I recommend people probably select
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.320]   a time planning horizon that's at least 10 years longer
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.400]   than they actually think that lives.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.200]   But all the plans that I develop,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   eventually end up running to 100% withdrawal rate
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.080]   at the end with a zero balance.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.760]   If you specify that you want to have a balance,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.880]   I've looked at those, it'll be in the book,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.040]   have a chart showing,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.200]   depending upon how much value you want left
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.920]   in your portfolio at the end of your retirement,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.440]   to keep 100% of your portfolio value,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.360]   really a steep cut in withdrawal rate.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.920]   We look like going from 5% down,
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360]   probably into the twos somewhere.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.200]   So it's steep.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.240]   It could be done once again.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.840]   - Yeah, no, that certainly sounds right.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.680]   All right.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.760]   All right, if I plan to retire in a country
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.560]   other than the U.S.,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.480]   what sort of safe withdrawal rate should I plan to use?
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.120]   - Oh, I think you can do 19%, no problem.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.320]   That's a tough question,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.640]   'cause I've been focusing primarily on U.S. investors.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.800]   I'm not xenophobic.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.720]   It's just that there's so much work
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.280]   just in that area for me.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.040]   I know Wade Fowler's done some work in that area,
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.160]   and he's determined that the withdrawal rates
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.880]   would probably be lesser,
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.600]   'cause we've been fortunate.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.480]   You know, United States investors
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.120]   have had a great stock market
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.480]   and access to those kinds of investments for a long time.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.040]   Not everyone has stock markets that perform as well,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.520]   or has access to those kinds of investments.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.400]   So for me, that's a really tough question to answer.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.840]   I'm gonna beg out on that, if you don't mind.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.000]   - Yeah, no, that's fine.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.320]   You know, I think another way I look at this question
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.560]   isn't necessarily that I'm going to be
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.600]   investing internationally
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.160]   so much as I'm perhaps investing domestically,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.000]   but living abroad, right?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.920]   And so that's a scenario.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.680]   You have to look at exchange rates
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.840]   and what the inflation--
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.720]   - Local tax rates and so forth.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.520]   Yeah, what kind of account you have, yeah.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.120]   - Yeah, what the inflation would be in that other country.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.960]   All right.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.600]   Isn't it a disadvantage to rebalance
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.960]   given the recognition of taxes?
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.840]   - Well, obviously, rebalancing,
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.560]   if you're using a taxable account
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.600]   and you're selling investments to rebalance,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.040]   there'll be some consequence of that.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.240]   But the importance of rebalancing is so great.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.880]   It adds so much value to the portfolio and your withdrawal rate.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.600]   It overwhelms tax considerations in the computations I do.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.360]   I look at that once again in the book.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.720]   I look at different rebalancing periods.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.880]   I found six to 12 as optimal,
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.720]   but there have been years where you could go 30 years
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.120]   without rebalancing and end up with a higher withdrawal rate.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.000]   It's very, very, it's unique.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.920]   There aren't too many situations like that.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.080]   They're all over the map.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.400]   I just wouldn't count on you retiring into a period like that.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.240]   I think the standard of practice of one year rebalancing
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   or slightly less, I pretty well agree with based on my data.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.160]   - All right, we have another case study question.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   If I want to assume inflation is 3%, I'm 73 years old,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.200]   what would be a safe withdrawal rate?
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.680]   - And what's the age?
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.800]   - 73.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.640]   - Okay.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.600]   I don't know.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.080]   My research doesn't assume
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.640]   what a particular inflation rate will be in the future.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.480]   We don't know.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.560]   Based on what's happened historically
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.720]   with a wide range of inflation rates.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.920]   I mean, someone could do a calculation
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.880]   on a spreadsheet with that.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.320]   But it's dangerous because if you're looking
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.200]   over a 30 year period, who knows what inflation will be?
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.280]   Who knows what returns will be?
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.840]   Who knows what the economic environment will be?
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   We could get an answer to that question.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.280]   And it'd probably be, you know,
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.960]   but it'd be using today's inflation regime,
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.760]   today's stock market valuations,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.280]   because that we know fairly certainly.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.520]   That question really is one for Nostradamus, not for me.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.920]   - Yeah, certainly to your point,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.280]   at least with respect to assuming living 10 years longer
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:29.440]   than you would guess, using 30 year data, 73 year old,
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.080]   that could be a relatively conservative way
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.280]   to look at that.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.240]   All right, here's a fun one.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.880]   What method of withdrawal do you use
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.840]   for your own retirement?
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.560]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.480]   I retired in 2013.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.640]   And at that time, four and a half percent
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   was the worst case.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.400]   So I said, let's do the worst case, you know?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.720]   And I've been fortunate that I retired
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   into a nice bull market that's gone on for a number of years.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.920]   So if you look at my current withdrawal rate,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.720]   you can calculate, it's quite a bit less
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.160]   than four and a half percent now.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.080]   So I'm a very happy person, you know,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.880]   in that regard, it's worked out nicely.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.160]   I still think we got some kind of ugly bear market
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.920]   lurking somewhere in the not so distant future.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.160]   But things have gone well enough here the first 10 years
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   that midterm bear markets are not as devastating
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.520]   as an early bear market, you know?
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   - Yeah, and given that you've had so much success
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.560]   investing early on in your retirement,
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.920]   and that's where all the risk is,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.080]   it's the beginning of retirement,
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.560]   it's that sequence risk,
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   have you adjusted your distribution rate?
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.320]   Have you increased it given the lucky outset
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.240]   of your retirement investing experience?
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.320]   - Well, you know, what I try to do,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.240]   I haven't actually made much adjustments,
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.440]   but I've tried to increase the amount of money
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.920]   I give my children.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.440]   That's why, you know, some people will say
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.720]   your expenses will go down in retirement.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.200]   I haven't seen that because I treat my gifting
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.400]   to my children as an expense.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.200]   And so I keep that up as high as it is.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.920]   It keeps my expenses basically growing
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.280]   pretty much with inflation on a steady basis.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.560]   - Now that bond yields are higher,
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.880]   how has that impacted your research?
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.720]   What does that mean for sustainable spending
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.120]   now that bonds are paying higher interest rates?
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.840]   - Well, I'm glad to see them there.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.280]   You know, for years we had the TINA condition,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.080]   there are no alternative to stocks,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.320]   which was absolutely nuts.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.360]   Now there is an alternative and we're approaching
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.400]   more closely to an historically average situation.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   So I'd say, since I'm a historical researcher,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.120]   it increases my confidence in my current forecast,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.720]   you know, using my methodology.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.960]   It's good to see.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.760]   We'll see what happens, you know,
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.440]   to bond yields in coming years.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.920]   Some are forecasting that 10 year
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.840]   could go down into the twos again.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.680]   I don't know.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.760]   Once again, that's not my job to forecast the future.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.960]   I have a hard enough time studying the past.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.440]   But it's reassuring to get back there
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.240]   to a more normal situation.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.640]   Another interesting case study.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.680]   What if you're retiring into ongoing health issues?
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.400]   Any thoughts or recommendations in that situation?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.600]   - Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.000]   - Oh, retiring with ongoing health issues.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.920]   So I'm assuming lots of high medical expenses.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.760]   - Sure.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.240]   - How does that impact distribution planning in retirement?
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.000]   - Well, it means your expenses potentially,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.720]   you're going to then, it's really a budgeting scene
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.840]   more of a drawl issue.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.480]   I mean, my job is to figure out the most you can get
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.400]   out of your retirement accounts safely, you know,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.920]   without taking unnecessary risk.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.480]   If you have an unusual situation in terms of your expenses,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.120]   that's going to have to be dealt pretty much
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   on the expense side because portfolio can only stand so much
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.680]   no matter what your physical condition is, you know.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.960]   Portfolio doesn't care.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.640]   It's going to do what it's going to do.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.040]   And hopefully closely follow historical, you know,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.000]   patterns.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.720]   - Yeah, it's certainly an issue of how terminal, right,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.560]   the health issue is.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.040]   Is it something that's chronic on ongoing?
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.320]   Are we going to have those expenses for a long time
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.800]   or is it going to be more short-lived and very expensive?
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.640]   - That's right.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.960]   And then it becomes a planning horizon issue.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.520]   - This question also from Boglehead's Reddit
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.000]   from username Buffanita, this one asks about
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   if retirement is a long time away for them in the future,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.680]   what sort of thoughts or considerations should they be
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.520]   giving to the research that they're coming across
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.360]   now versus weighing that against future research?
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.560]   How seriously should they take the 4% rule,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.960]   the Trinity study, et cetera, for something that may come out
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.000]   when they actually are ready to retire?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.520]   - So that's an interesting situation where people,
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.600]   perhaps with 30 years to retirement,
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.000]   are wondering whether or not the research I've done
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.240]   will still be applicable in the future.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.820]   That's really a very tough question to answer.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.540]   To a certain extent, there are a lot of underlying
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.220]   assumptions to my research is one is that markets
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.540]   will behave pretty much the same as they have in the past,
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.180]   that the U.S. economy will behave pretty much
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.340]   as it has in the past.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:48.020]   I've seen some people who feel that the U.S. growth rate,
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.540]   the GDP, well, there we are.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.340]   That was not predictable.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.560]   - I guess that was our five-minute warning.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.800]   - As usual, I find myself in the dark.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.280]   And that does raise a lot of tough questions
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   that I don't know how to answer other than,
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.320]   I suspect the United States will continue to be
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.560]   a powerful engine of growth for a long time
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   into the future, and that we may slow down a little bit
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.120]   our growth rate for demographic reasons
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.440]   or for other considerations, but I wouldn't necessarily
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.760]   have a pessimistic view about the future.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.360]   At least neutral, and I think it's even happier
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.080]   to be optimistic, so I've been optimistic.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.360]   - Yeah, I think with respect to considering your research,
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.320]   looking at what has worked in the past for spending
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.280]   sustainably in retirement, that worst case,
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.560]   October '68, that period of high inflation,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.160]   that's where we get that 4% guideline.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.800]   So if there is worse performance over the next 30 years,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.840]   that was just a lower level of spending than that,
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.720]   but absent that, 4% would still, or 4% higher
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.600]   given the additional other asset classes, probably.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.140]   - Yeah, and you know, it's possible.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.560]   I'm never gonna claim that the current levels,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.520]   historical precedents, are gonna last forever,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.440]   'cause we know they haven't, because they changed in 1968.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.320]   Prior to 1968, there was a higher withdrawal rate,
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.800]   you know, it would've been, and if you look
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.040]   at the very start, you know, 1926,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.680]   it was around 5 3/4, 6%, and then the Great Depression
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   brought that down, and then World War II,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.640]   and things, and so gradually we went from like about 6%
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   down to about 5%, and it could happen.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.680]   We could enter a period of history
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.920]   where some terrible things could happen,
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.600]   and you'll end up with a new worst case scenario.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.280]   I fully admit that, but I had, you know,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.240]   this current one's lasted for 50 years,
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.720]   which is the longest time any withdrawal,
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.000]   worst case withdrawal rate has lasted in the last 100,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.680]   so hopefully we get a few more years out of it, or decades.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.480]   - Yeah, we'll certainly know 30 years from now.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.780]   - Yeah.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.620]   - All right.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:10.440]   What role did dividends play in your research?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.320]   - I don't specifically isolate dividends.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.300]   You know, basically my research is based
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.600]   on a total return basis, where your portfolio
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.000]   earns interest, and dividends, and capital appreciation,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.920]   and if it's a taxable portfolio, you know,
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.240]   we're gonna tax them differently,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.080]   but if it's a tax-deferred portfolio,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   they're all kinda lumped together,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   and just basically grows your portfolio on a total basis.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   I know some folks like high-dividend stocks,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.760]   and from the perspective of my research,
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.360]   it really doesn't make too much difference,
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.560]   but I can see a positive...
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.800]   The hardest thing when you establish an investment plan
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.280]   is sticking with it, particularly
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.440]   when the big bear market comes.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.720]   And if dividend-paying stocks continue
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.800]   to pay good dividends, they're a bear market,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.160]   and give an investor a sense of security,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.720]   and less panic, because they're still earning some dividend,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.440]   I think that's a plus for that particular strategy.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.840]   If it can keep you on your plan, you know,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.720]   I'd go for it.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.880]   - We've got a couple minutes left.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.560]   Tell us about some of the newer asset classes
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.040]   that you've added to your research.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.080]   Certainly, we started with the S&P 500,
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.640]   intermediate from Treasuries.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.720]   What are those other asset classes that you've shown?
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.160]   - Yeah, I started out with, of course,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.320]   just two asset classes, U.S. large-cap stocks,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.520]   and U.S. intermediate-term government bonds,
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.520]   and I added 2006, a U.S. small-cap stocks,
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   and then I added, and recently, several years ago,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.480]   I added international stocks.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.880]   I had U.S. micro-cap stocks, U.S. mid-cap stocks,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.680]   and Treasury bills as a cash surrogate.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.080]   And I wonder, and those, of course,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.480]   elevated the portfolio.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.160]   I suspect, you know, because I didn't get that large a bump
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.600]   when I added those four asset classes recently,
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.200]   that we're probably approaching diminishing returns.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.360]   There are other asset classes that we could use.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.840]   We could use REITs, commodities, we could use gold,
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.000]   alternatives.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.480]   I suspect, though, that the correlations
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.280]   between the assets are gonna become more difficult
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.560]   to be advantageous in that you're gonna find
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.240]   that we may get 5.1, 5.2.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.440]   We're probably getting pretty close to the limits
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.520]   of what we can get with a diversified portfolio.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.320]   - Did each of those sub-asset classes
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.240]   add to the distribution rate?
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.760]   - I didn't, you know, that's an interesting question.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.160]   I didn't try to add them one at a time
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.240]   and see what the effect was.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.040]   I added them as a lump, you know?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.800]   'Cause I was trying to replicate what most investors
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.480]   would use a well-diversified portfolio.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.320]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.480]   - Yeah, I wonder if bills were a little bit of a drag.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.360]   - Yeah, I'll add that to my list, though.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.400]   Thank you, John.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.560]   One more thing to do.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.440]   - Happy to add to your list.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.040]   Well, folks, that is gonna be it.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.080]   That is the end of our interview with Bill Mangan.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.720]   He will be returning in a couple hours
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.080]   to rumble with Christine Benz and Carson Jeske
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.960]   for our withdrawal rate rumble in a couple hours,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.920]   back here in the big room when we merge it all together.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.120]   We'll see you there soon.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.960]   - Knives out.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.920]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.760]   Thank you all.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.920]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
