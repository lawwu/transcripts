[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   A listener named Cal writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I'm reading through your book,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.720]   'Don't Waste Your Life,' and I have a question about Galatians 6.14 and boasting only in
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   the cross.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760]   Specifically, though, what does it mean to be dead to the world?"
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   Let me get the verse right in front of us so we can hear how that phrase occurs.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.240]   "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.260]   world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.480]   So the question's coming, I think, from that last phrase, "I am crucified to the world,"
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.440]   or "I am dead to the world."
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.840]   So my first question is, even before I ask, "What does it mean to be dead to the world?"
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360]   Is what does it mean to be dead?
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:05.880]   And I think, in Paul's mind, that idea of Christians being dead starts with Jesus' words
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.160]   in a bunch of places in the Gospels, like Luke 9, where he says, "The Son of Man must
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.760]   suffer many things and be killed, and on the third day be raised."
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.040]   And he said to all, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.380]   his cross daily and follow me."
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.840]   When Bonhoeffer read that, remember, he said, "Jesus was saying, 'When I call you, I bid
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.800]   you to come and die.'"
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.360]   So to take a cross means to die.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.860]   So to follow Jesus is to experience a kind of death.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.040]   And the way he says it in Luke 9 is, "It's a daily taking up of the cross."
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.440]   So there's a daily dying going on.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   And then when Paul picks that up, I think, for example, when he describes baptism, he
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   says, "We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.520]   from the dead, we too might walk in newness of life."
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   So at the point of conversion and faith signified in the waters of baptism, we are being united
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.800]   to Christ, and when we're united to Christ, the death that he dies, we die.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.920]   In fact, the very next verse, I think, in Romans 6, verse 5, makes that connection with
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   union with Christ.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.040]   If we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.140]   him in a resurrection like his.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.640]   So we died when we were united to Christ, and we were united to Christ when we believed
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.580]   in him and signified that in baptism.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.320]   And so for me, the next question becomes, "So who died?"
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.220]   I'm a living, I'm talking to you right now, and Cal wrote and asked the question, so he
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.740]   doesn't sound dead, he's thinking, so who actually died?
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.960]   So let's go back to Galatians, and Paul, I think, answers that, helps answer it anyway,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:21.180]   when he says in chapter 5, "Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.780]   passions and desires."
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:35.940]   So the old me, which Paul calls the flesh, that self-reliant, proud, idolatrous, world-loving,
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.380]   world-worshipping self, died when I trusted Christ, because I was united with him in his
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.620]   death, and when he died, I died, and the part of me that dies is the old unbelieving, self-reliant
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.580]   self.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.860]   And a new person comes into being, and who's that?
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.420]   And Galatians gives the answer again.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.060]   I think, I mean, one of my favorite verses in all the Bible, ever since I was a sophomore
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.100]   in college, has been Galatians 2.20, "I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.980]   I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.060]   So it sounds like the new person who's alive is Christ, but then it says, "And the life
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.140]   I now live," so, oh, I thought I was dead.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.900]   No, you're not dead, because as Christ lives, you're alive, how?
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.340]   The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.380]   himself for me.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.860]   So the new me is not the old unbelieving, selfish, self-reliant, world-worshipping me,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.820]   it's the new trusting in Christ, enjoying the life of Christ in me person.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.860]   So there's this new creation, there's this new Cal, this new Tony that has come into
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.140]   being, and it's marked mainly by "I live by faith."
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.360]   And I think faith is not only trusting that he died for me, but trusting him for all that
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.940]   God is for me in him.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.220]   He has become my world, he has become my treasure, he has become my satisfaction.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.500]   So now I go back, after all that, I go back to Galatians 6, 14, where it says we're dead
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.160]   or we're crucified to the world, and I think that means my flesh once loved the world.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.500]   Back in verse 24 of chapter 5, it said it died with its passions and its desires.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.260]   My old flesh just loved the world, craved the world, depended on the world, needed the
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.020]   world, worshipped the world as its God and its satisfaction.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:59.060]   And now all that died, and the world now has been crucified to me as a God.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.860]   So if you say, "What sense does the world die to me?"
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.180]   I said, "The world once was a God to me, it once was my life, and I killed it, I crucified
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.820]   it, I put it to death with its desires, and my flesh died."
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.220]   So my dying to it, and it dying to me is the same reality.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:25.860]   I killed this pseudo-reality called the world, which was posing as an all-satisfying God
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:35.580]   to me, and my old, blind, foolish self who worshipped this world died when I died with
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.580]   Christ.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.260]   And here's just one, when I think about this, I want to make one qualification, because
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.600]   God made the world.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.620]   The world is not evil.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620]   Material is not evil.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.760]   Physicality is not evil.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.540]   God meant the world to be not our God, but a gift.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:04.180]   And so maybe the simplest way to say it is that when you come to Christ and the old world-worshipping
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:13.260]   self dies, what comes alive is a self of faith in Christ that receives the world no longer
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.180]   as a God, but as a gift.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:24.700]   So I would say directly to Cal, every time the world starts to claim for itself more
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:31.940]   than it is, tell it, "World, I'm dead to that pseudo-claim.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.540]   Jesus is my treasure now.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:41.260]   He died to have me, and he died to give himself to me as my all-satisfying treasure.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:49.180]   So world, I'm dead to you, and you're dead to me as a God, and I now come to you no longer
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.660]   as my God, but as a gift from my loving Savior.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.740]   And every time you come to me now, I'm going to see Him in you, and if I can't see Him
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.660]   in you, I'm going to reject you."
