[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   Today's email is from a friend of ours,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.560]   a listener named Matthew, who lives in San Antonio.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.920]   He's thought up a creative way to get us
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.720]   into the tricky thicket of end of life decisions.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.640]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.160]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.680]   I know from listening to the podcast for years,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.560]   you are very hesitant to speak
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   to specific end of life decisions
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.320]   because they require so much wisdom
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.340]   from medical professionals
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.480]   and because every life is so different.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.660]   But we have nearly endless medical advances
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.720]   we can take advantage of now to prolong life.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640]   So I'd like to ask my question strictly
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.880]   within a hypothetical that I made up.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.160]   Here it goes.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400]   Imagine a 40-year-old middle-class Texan,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600]   a regenerate Bible-believing Christian man
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.180]   married to a godly Christian woman for 18 years.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.760]   He's diagnosed with aggressive terminal cancer
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   and has two options before him,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.240]   neither of which he likes or favors,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.080]   but one of which he must choose.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.960]   One, if he does nothing,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   he lives a relatively normal life for one more year.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.040]   Two, with aggressive treatment and three surgeries,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.340]   he will live for four years
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.860]   and those years will be less than pleasant.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.940]   He has modest life insurance.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.080]   His gracious employer will continue to employ him
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.280]   and pay his salary plus one year after he passes.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.780]   So two years or five of income.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.800]   He has two kids, 16 and 12,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.480]   and it's unclear if they're believers.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.200]   What, if any, biblical principles
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.740]   would inform your own choice between these two options?
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.840]   - Okay, as I have reflected on this hypothetical,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.480]   but sounds very plausible, very real.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.160]   I'm sure it's happening multiple times every day like this.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.600]   I have seven observations, seven,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.740]   you can call them principles if he likes,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.740]   to take into account facing these two scenarios
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.820]   that he laid out.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820]   First, I would pray and I would ask my friends to pray
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.800]   in either the one-year scenario or the four-year scenario.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   I would ask them to pray for my healing.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.920]   I would not ask that probably if I were 85,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280]   because in this fallen world,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.400]   the death of an octogenarian is more or less normal.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.640]   That is, it's God's plan that we die
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.400]   rather than live forever in this age.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   But at 40, death is much more unnatural and intrusive,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.860]   and therefore it is more fitting, it seems to me,
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.780]   to seek God for the miracle of healing.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.560]   And that decision to pray for healing does not dictate
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.780]   whether I choose to get the aggressive treatment or not,
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.720]   because God can heal me without it
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.920]   and he can heal me through it.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   So the choice to pursue aggressive prayer for healing
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.320]   does not decide which option I go with.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   I would pursue prayer in either case for healing.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.520]   Number two, I would keep clearly in mind
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.800]   that both scenarios, the one-year
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   and the four-year scenarios, are human probabilities,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.000]   not certain destinies.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.520]   If you choose the one-year scenario,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   you might feel miserable the entire year instead of good.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.540]   If you choose the four-year scenario,
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.480]   you might feel better, in spite of all the surgery and chemo,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.880]   that you ever dreamed you could for four years.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.160]   You are only dealing with human probabilities,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   and when you stir in prayer,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   you are opening yourself to the fact
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   that God may turn the one-year scenario
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.380]   into a four-year scenario,
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.440]   and he may turn the four-year scenario
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.200]   into a one-year scenario.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.820]   Prayer is the glorious wild card,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.020]   and God may answer in dozens of ways we don't expect.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.800]   So when I say that both scenarios are only probabilities,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   I am saying that not only may humans be wrong,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   doctors may be wrong, but God has infinite options
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.080]   at his disposal for how you spend those years.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.120]   That's number two.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   Number three, I would remind myself
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.400]   that both death and suffering
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.260]   for the Christian can be for our good.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.320]   They are evil in themselves in the sense
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.440]   that they are contrary to God's original perfect design,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.760]   but in God's providence,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   both death and suffering serve his children.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.960]   Death serves his children by introducing them
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.980]   into immediate fellowship with Christ,
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.620]   which Paul says is far better,
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.040]   and suffering, like Paul's thorn in the flesh,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.960]   can serve us by keeping us humble
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.920]   and deepening our reliance on the Lord Jesus
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.620]   and enabling us to glorify his power in our weakness.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.400]   And not only that, but facing death joyfully,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   square in the face, may be a compelling witness
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   to our family, our children, and to others
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.120]   and bring them to Christ.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.120]   Or suffering, endured with deep, joyful, tearful confidence
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   in Christ, may be a compelling witness
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.700]   to our family and others.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.520]   So it's important not to play off
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.040]   against each other death and suffering
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.140]   as though one is intrinsically more likely
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.740]   to be a blessing than the other.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.400]   We don't know that.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.480]   Either one may be a greater blessing
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.020]   than the other in our lives and in the lives of our family.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.300]   Number four, both the one-year scenario,
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.020]   feeling good and dying early,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.260]   and the four-year scenario, feeling bad and living longer,
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.540]   both could be used by God for the salvation
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.140]   of our children and the strengthening
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.140]   of the faith of our wives and the magnifying
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.880]   of Christ among medical professionals
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.520]   and church members and lost neighbors.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.940]   We cannot predict with any certainty
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.060]   whether our willingness to face death early
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.940]   or our willingness to suffer long
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.860]   will have the greater force in commending
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.200]   the all-sufficiency of Christ to sustain us.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.780]   We don't know.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.420]   God could use either one to save our children and others.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.240]   Number five, neither the one-year scenario
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.740]   nor the four-year scenario need be presumptuous
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.760]   as though we were taking God's prerogative
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.620]   into our own hands by choosing.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.540]   We will need God's help in both scenarios.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.020]   Satan will threaten us in the short scenario
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.020]   with fear and anger and worldliness in how good we feel.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.180]   He will cause us to focus on the onrush
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.040]   of the day of our death coming next year,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.900]   and he will tempt us to be bitter and angry,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.520]   and our faith will not survive
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.420]   without the sovereign help of the grace of God.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.720]   And if we choose the long scenario,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   more life, more misery, Satan may have a field day
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.260]   causing our bodily and mental weaknesses
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.040]   to make it almost impossible for us
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.700]   to do the kind of spiritual warfare we have to do
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.840]   in order to persevere to the end.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   We will not make it to the end through this suffering
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   without the sovereign grace of God
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.400]   sustaining us and carrying us.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.220]   Number six, in both scenarios,
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.440]   I would mobilize a team of trusted
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.780]   and loved Christian friends who would pledge,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.220]   as much as they're able, to walk with me
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.240]   through either scenario to the end.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.260]   I have in mind not only daily prayer for me,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.120]   that my faith not fail,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.420]   and that the pain not overwhelm me,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.260]   or the absence of pain not result in my worldliness,
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.680]   but I also have in mind that these friends
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.460]   would feed me the word of God regularly.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.940]   Emails, mail, texts, phone calls, visits.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.380]   Man shall not live by bread alone,
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.680]   but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   and that's especially true
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   as we walk up to the edge of eternity.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.700]   I will need the word of God.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.260]   Like 1 Thessalonians 5, 9,
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.020]   God has not destined you, John Piper, for wrath,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.220]   but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.700]   who died for you so that whether you wake or sleep,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.300]   you might live with him.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.780]   I need somebody to look me in the eye
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.480]   and say that to me in the name of God.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.780]   And finally, number seven,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:20.420]   I will keep in mind that neither of these choices
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.420]   is a choice to hate life or commit suicide,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.660]   or allow anyone else to perform euthanasia on me.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.020]   Life is a glorious thing now and after death,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.380]   and best of all, after the resurrection
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.020]   in the new world with Jesus.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.500]   But I will cherish the gift of life now,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.300]   and I will seek not to waste it.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.260]   One year or four years,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.380]   whether I'm feeling good or feeling miserable,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.360]   whether death is tomorrow or years away,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   I will seek to treasure Jesus Christ above all things
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.040]   and bring as many people with me as I can
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   into the everlasting enjoyment of his presence.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.420]   - So carefully set forth, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.280]   And Matthew, thank you for the carefully worded scenario
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.160]   put in a way that makes it easier for us to address,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.920]   namely by making it hypothetical.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.960]   That's really helpful.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.360]   If you have such a question about end of life decisions
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.420]   and how to think through them with biblical reasoning,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.940]   send that question to us.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.300]   Go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
