[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.800]   Nick DiBona: Before hypermode, I worked at Vercel.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   We had an office down the street above a pizzeria,
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.760]   and we had three big problems.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.520]   One, we were losing to other JavaScript frameworks.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.320]   Two, we were losing badly to other hosting providers.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.560]   And three, I was losing to my diet of exclusively pepperoni
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.980]   pizza.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.560]   Eventually, we started to win, not because we were smart
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   or we knew all the right answers,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640]   but because we dealt this core competency of iterating
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.340]   really, really, really quickly.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.760]   We didn't know the optimum strategy,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.020]   but we figured if we just tried more things faster
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.700]   than everyone else, we'd eventually
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.620]   be able to adapt and figure out the right products and strategies
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.960]   to figure out what the market wanted.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   Iteration is the compound interest of software.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.460]   Keep doing it long enough, and eventually really good stuff
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.460]   starts to happen.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.160]   Because we tried a lot of things really quickly,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.200]   we eventually figured out two things.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.080]   One, developers want to incrementally adopt new technologies.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080]   And two, they don't want to commit to architectural patterns
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.580]   before they know how their application is actually going to work.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.580]   But iteration can't happen if you're afraid of getting it wrong.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.080]   The same thing that has held back web is also holding back AI.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.580]   And if I'm honest, there are even more things for us to get wrong about Gen AI.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.080]   When I think about it, I'm grossly overwhelmed.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.580]   What's the right hardware?
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580]   What's the right model?
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.580]   What's the right prompt?
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.080]   How do I integrate?
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   How do I monitor?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   How do I improve?
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   Everyone here knows a horror story of someone with a runaway bill,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   a hallucinating chatbot, a project that took months and months
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.580]   and never delivered any value.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.080]   And in the end, we need to build systems that de-risk getting it wrong.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   Because we are going to get it wrong a lot.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.580]   Picking the wrong model doesn't matter if there's no friction to switching it out.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.580]   Integration is simple when your classical systems and your AI systems use the same APIs.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.580]   You can fearlessly make changes to prompt strategies, data mixes,
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.580]   if you can trace that inference step by step by step.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.580]   At HyperMode, we care deeply about making AI approachable.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   Everyone here should be able to put AI in their apps without specialized skills.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.580]   At its core, HyperMode is a runtime.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580]   It allows you to easily integrate models and data into AI functions.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.580]   We then surround that runtime with a bunch of tools that make it easy for you to rapidly iterate
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580]   and observe those AI functions in prod.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.580]   We make it easy to get started, incrementally adopt AI as appropriate,
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.580]   and then as your team develops those skills, reimagine those applications as AI native.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.580]   First and foremost, we want to make the developer experience of developing with AI a lot less terrible.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.580]   When it comes to adding a new model to your service,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.580]   you probably don't want to read a bunch of pages of docs to figure out the temperatures on a 0 to 2 rather than a 0 to 1 or a 1 to 10.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.580]   With HyperMode, we provide you type ahead and your favorite code editor right out of the box.
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.580]   No SDKs, nothing to download.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.580]   Then when you do ship to prod, we give you strong defaults just to get started.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580]   Or if you have your own stack, bring it along.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.580]   In either case, we'll remove a lot of that complexity for you.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.580]   For example, traditional RAG requires N+1 requests.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.580]   You need to make an additional call to embed the inputs.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580]   Go talk to your vector store with HyperMode.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.580]   You can do that all in one request.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.580]   We've built an in-memory embedding and search service that will allow you to do that and save a couple of milliseconds per request.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.580]   Finally, building intuition around non-deterministic systems is hard.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.580]   Each model has its own personality, and we make it really easy for you to quickly compare different inferences, different tunes, different models.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.580]   And you can then export this data set to fine tune.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.580]   On Monday, your boss is going to ask you, what did you learn at AI World Fair?
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.580]   If you come by our workshop after lunch, I'll prove to you that you can make iteration velocity of core competency.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   The team that built all this amazing stuff will be there.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.580]   We'll show you how to build natural language search, intelligently sort every data list in your product, detect outliers, catch bad guys.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.580]   You'll walk over the demo that you're proud of and a plan to put something like it in prod by the end of next month.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.580]   And if seeing my happy face again and building something really cool is not enough, we'll give you $1,000 in HyperMode credits to get started.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.580]   Thank you all so much.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580]   Thank you all so much.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.580]   Thank you all so much.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.580]   Thank you.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.240]   We'll see you next time.
