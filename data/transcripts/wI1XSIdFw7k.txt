[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.440]   in Paul's epistle to Titus, in the second chapter, verses 11 to 14.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.320]   Verses 11 to 14 in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to Titus.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:30.480]   "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.760]   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.440]   in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.520]   God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.760]   These are the things which the apostle commends this young preacher, Titus, to speak and to
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.200]   exhort and to rebuke with all authority.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.780]   Now I want this evening in particular to deal with two of the statements in this portion
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.640]   of scripture.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.600]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, looking for that blessed hope and
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   the glorious appearing of the great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   Now we began looking at this great and thrilling portion of scripture last Sunday evening,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   and I indicated that I was doing so in order that we might learn from it what is in reality
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.960]   the message of this season of the year, which we describe as Advent season, or if you prefer
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800]   it, the season of Christmas.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.960]   It is a time when we ought to be learning certain lessons.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   It is not something vague and nebulous and indefinite.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.760]   That is what the world makes of it, but that is not what we are to make of it.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.360]   That is not what the New Testament makes of it.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.340]   It says that this has very specific and special lessons to teach us and to teach to the whole
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.040]   of mankind.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060]   And therefore the business of the Christian church at a time like this and any Christian
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:50.760]   preacher is to extract these lessons, these messages, and to hold them before the people.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.080]   Now we have already seen this, for me to summarise very hurriedly, what we saw last Sunday evening.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.520]   We have seen that this event reminds us of the historical character of the Christian
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.480]   faith.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.880]   It is something that is based definitely on events that have taken place in the course
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   of history.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.240]   It is unlike every other religion.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.560]   It is unlike every philosophy.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.280]   These other things are all ideas, they are points of view, they are thoughts.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.440]   Now that is not the essential thing about Christianity.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.840]   Christianity is something that is based upon actions, events, things that have literally
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.200]   taken place in the course of human history in this world.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.060]   Now that is absolutely vital.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.600]   The differentia of the Christian faith is that it is historical in its character.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.080]   And it is a good thing therefore to remind ourselves of that at such a season as this.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.240]   We are being made to think of the birth of a babe in a little place called Bethlehem.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   Now that is a fact.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.160]   That is something that happened.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.640]   Bethlehem is not some imaginary city.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.080]   It is not something that is conjured up in someone's mind and which he puts into a novel
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.280]   or into a fantasy.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.000]   You can go and visit Bethlehem now.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.800]   It is a literal place.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.680]   And in that literal place, belonging solidly to geography, at a given period, at a given
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   point in history, at a given date, this babe was born.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.360]   And that is but one of a series.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:45.160]   All our faith, our belief, our message is something that is derived from this person.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.320]   And these various things that have happened to him in time.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   Now that is the first thing.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   Salvation is the result of something that has been done.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.280]   The grace of God, says the apostle, "that bringeth salvation hath appeared."
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.280]   It is not something that God says to us.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.860]   It is something that God does.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.700]   It is not just God saying, "I will forgive you if you repent, or I will do this or that."
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   No, no.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.540]   It is God doing something, taking action in the realm of history, which leads to the releasing
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.040]   of his grace and all that accompanies it.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.520]   In other words, and that is why I say it is so appropriate that we should be observing
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.320]   the Lord's Supper this Sunday evening before Christmas Day.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.900]   Salvation has come to us, who have it, because the Son of God came into this world, because
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.400]   he died upon a cross, because he rose again.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.100]   It isn't a teaching.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.080]   It isn't something that God just says to us.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.700]   It is something that God has made possible in that way and through those particular historic
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   events.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.900]   Very well, there is something I say that we must never lose sight of.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.300]   And we have been reminded also as to who this is.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.740]   Who is this babe that is born in Bethlehem?
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.540]   And you remember that he is described here as the Great God.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.980]   I find it difficult to move away from that.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.500]   We who are interested in history and in important events, we who look at the main headings in
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.580]   the paper and especially that which is splashed right across the front page, we who are stimulated
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.500]   by that which is sensational and always want the unusual.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.380]   Have you considered this?
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.660]   That he, as the hymn has just been putting it, who framed and fashioned those stars and
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:10.300]   all the myriad marvels of the Milky Way, should be born as a helpless babe.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.940]   The Great God and Savior have appeared.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.820]   Very well, we don't stay with that this evening, but of course if we are not clear
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.220]   about that, we don't begin to understand the message of Christmas.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:33.340]   The babe of Bethlehem is the eternal and everlasting Son of God.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.820]   But now the thing I want to emphasize this evening is this.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:47.140]   The essence of this Christian message is this person and especially what he has done and
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.340]   especially his appearing in this world.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.100]   That is Christianity.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:08:01.260]   Jesus Christ and his appearings in this world, for you notice there are two of them, the
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.980]   grace of God that bringeth salvation, has appeared.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.980]   Looking for and waiting for what?
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:15.620]   The blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.600]   He has appeared, he will appear.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.060]   Now this is Christianity.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.380]   It's all there between those two foci, if you like, of this great ellipse of his mighty
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.260]   activity.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:38.820]   And what I want to do with you this evening is to consider these two appearings of this
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.220]   Great God.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.500]   You notice the apostle puts them here.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.140]   And therefore I want to say three general things about them before we come to look at
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.540]   them separately and in detail.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:09:00.260]   The first point I would make is this, that these two appearings must always be taken
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.420]   together.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.260]   You notice the apostle puts them together here.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.740]   He doesn't content himself with saying, "Now, Timothy, what I tell you to preach and to
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:16.220]   speak and to exhort and to rebuke with all authority is that the grace of God that bringeth
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.340]   salvation hath appeared."
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.280]   He doesn't stop there.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.500]   He says, "Go on and tell them to look for his appearing again."
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:34.420]   Now this is a very important point, a very important principle.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:41.980]   The Lord Jesus Christ and his work must always be taken as a whole.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.620]   And the moment we forget that, we begin to go astray.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.460]   There is obviously in mankind a very deep and inherent tendency to take parts of him
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.060]   only and to leave the rest out of consideration.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.500]   But the gospel itself never does that.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.660]   There are particular actions, there are particular events, and every one of them is important.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:09.300]   Every one of them has its own special significance, which we must study.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.420]   But what I am saying is that if we stop at any one of the particulars, instead of taking
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:23.580]   the whole sweep, the entire compass, the total message, we shall of necessity go astray.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.140]   So here the apostle puts it to us.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.980]   He hath appeared, he will appear.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.300]   And these two must always go together.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.980]   Now let us see what I mean by that.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:43.780]   There are so many people in the world who look at Bethlehem and who never get beyond
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.900]   Bethlehem.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   They were taught when they were children to say the little prayer, "Gentle Jesus, meek
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.980]   and mild, look upon the little child.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.460]   Pity my simplicity, suffer me to come to thee."
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.420]   And they have never got beyond that.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.580]   As great God is still to them, gentle Jesus, meek and mild.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.380]   They start at Bethlehem, they stop at Bethlehem.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.940]   They rather like a Christianity that begins and ends at Bethlehem.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.180]   They think it's very sweet.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.020]   They can look on and admire it and paint their pictures, write their poetry, and they stop
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   there.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.180]   That's it, that's what we want, they say, in this dark and hard and cruel world.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.620]   They stop there.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:44.660]   There are others, you see, who are intent only upon his life and teaching.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.900]   They don't care whether he was born of the Virgin Mary or not, they tell you that.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.820]   Quite immaterial to them.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.100]   All they want is the teaching.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.140]   His life and teaching.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.660]   Not a bit interested in his birth, in the whole miracle of the Incarnation, in the astonishing
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.420]   event that happened there in the Virgin's womb.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.780]   Means nothing at all to them, but they want this ethical teaching.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.260]   And they're delivering that message tonight.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.500]   And they're always talking the same things.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:17.260]   It's always about the bombs, and always about war, and always about the racial question.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.900]   Life and teaching, not interested in Bethlehem, not interested in Calvary, not interested
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.900]   in the resurrection.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.900]   Generally, they don't believe in them.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.140]   They pick it out there.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:40.500]   Then there are others who look alone at his death, because that is to them the only thing.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.300]   There they see that passive resistance.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:52.020]   Or there they see that pale Galilean, that is, Theta, who was misunderstood by his contemporaries
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:59.980]   because he was so much in advance of them, like a Socrates and others being put to death.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.340]   And that is all they see.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.020]   They miss out everything else.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:10.100]   Then there are others who emphasize only his resurrection.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.220]   They bypass the cross very frequently.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.380]   They say the one thing that matters is that that Jesus is still alive, and he can still
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.260]   help us.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.180]   And that's the only thing for them.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.420]   And then there are others who spend the whole of their time upon the second coming and upon
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.700]   things that are going to happen.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:34.100]   Well, no, what I'm concerned to say is this, that to divide up this great message in that
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.620]   way and to stop at particulars and to make everything of one particular is rarely to
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.900]   miss the message and to deny it finally.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:47.020]   "No, no," says Paul, "the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared."
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.020]   Yes, and will appear.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.420]   And you see, when we come to the communion service, we shall be reading something like
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:14:01.460]   this, "For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this wine, ye do declare the Lord's
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.860]   death till he come."
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.860]   That's it.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.740]   That's the way to do it.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.900]   We don't merely declare his death.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:15.060]   We declare his death till, until he comes, comes again.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.120]   We don't stop at the death.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.660]   We don't stop even at the resurrection.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.560]   We go on till he comes again.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.540]   So the two advents must always be taken together.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.400]   The whole movement of Christ coming out of heaven and returning to heaven and again coming
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.500]   back must always be taken together.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.560]   That's my first general remark.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.260]   My second is an obvious one.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.140]   It's the thing I want to develop this evening.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.740]   It is the contrast between the two advents.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:58.180]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, looking, looking for that blessed
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:05.860]   hope and the appearance of the glory of the great God and Saviour.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   What a contrast!
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.020]   We'll come to it in a minute.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:20.060]   My third general remark, therefore, is this one, that each of his comings, both the comings,
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:27.940]   have not only been entirely different in and of themselves, but have been utterly and absolutely
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.900]   different from what men expected them to be.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.120]   Now, think for a moment.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.980]   Think of the Jewish conception, the conception of the children of Israel of the coming of
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   the Messiah.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.220]   How did they expect him to come?
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:50.740]   They expected him to come as a mighty personage, as a great king, heading a great army, a political
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.740]   might.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.420]   And he would set up his army and his kingdom and conquer all his enemies and tower over
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.420]   the whole world.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.140]   That's what they expected.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.020]   How different was the event?
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.020]   Totally different.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:12.840]   Almost the exact opposite of what they had anticipated.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:22.220]   And you know, my friends, the same thing is true with regard to the second advent.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:30.780]   The world, I say, likes to think of him still as that gentle Jesus, meek and mild.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.460]   The world doesn't think of him as the king and as the Lord.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:43.520]   And as the New Testament tells us, there will be some terrible surprises when he does come
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.680]   back again.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.100]   It won't be according to the popular idea.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.740]   It will be very different indeed.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.940]   Always I say, mankind is wrong about him.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.760]   Wrong about him the first time, equally wrong will it be about him the second time.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.340]   Very well then, let's carry these ideas in our minds and now proceed to look at what
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.420]   we are told about the two advents.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.980]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.100]   What is the message of Christmas for us?
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.500]   What does Christmas tell us to do?
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.980]   Well, the first thing it tells us to do is this.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.780]   It tells us to look back to his first advent, to his first coming.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.660]   It tells us to look back at what he has done.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.300]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.180]   Very well then, I invite you this evening to look back with me.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:49.260]   I'm asking you to cast back your minds nearly two thousand long years ago to something that
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.740]   happened on that night about which we've been singing and about which we've been reading
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.740]   in the second chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.540]   There he appeared.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.380]   It's a fact of history, I say.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.540]   It's something that's taken place.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.580]   Look back at it.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.580]   Let's consider it.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.540]   His first appearing, his first coming.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.860]   And what do we notice?
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.820]   Well, of course, we've got to notice two main things about it.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:24.340]   First and foremost, the way in which he came, the mode of his coming.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.500]   And this is, I say, the thing that astonished and astounded the Jews and became such a stumbling
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500]   block to them.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.100]   How did he come?
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:40.180]   Well, the one word that really sums it up is the word "lowly."
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.340]   Lowly.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.600]   In a lowly cattle shed.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.580]   Something about that first coming.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.980]   He is characterized by this lowliness and this humility.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.980]   Without the glory.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:04.820]   Yes, Charles Wesley has put it once and forever in that immortal phrase.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:10.220]   "Mild he laid his glory by."
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.620]   And again he puts it.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.820]   Here he is.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.980]   He's come, the Lord of glory, the great God.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.660]   But how has he come?
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:24.100]   "Veiled in flesh, the glory seen."
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.540]   Hail incarnate deity.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.940]   Veiled in flesh.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.940]   Now that is the great characteristic, I say, of his first appearing, the way in which he
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:42.540]   came nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.020]   Incognito.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:54.540]   The veiling of the glory, the hiding of his person and of his true personality in flesh.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.420]   And the covering of the flesh stood between men and women and the glory.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   Some had an insight.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.940]   John is able to say, "We beheld his glory."
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.820]   Yes, but the majority saw nothing but the flesh, veiled in flesh.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:16.380]   And everything that accompanied it, of course, was in character.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:23.740]   He was there born as a babe.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:31.260]   We are talking about the great God, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:40.060]   And he was born as a helpless babe, as helpless as any babe that's ever been born.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:47.180]   And was taken and the swaddling clothes were put upon him and he was laid in a manger.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.140]   Now there's nothing lowlier than a babe.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:56.460]   There's nothing more helpless than a babe, yet that is how he came.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:03.580]   And let us not forget that it happened in a stable or, if you like, in a cattle shed.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.820]   Because there was no room for them in the inn.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.300]   The maker of the universe, the one without whom nothing was made that is made, was born
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.220]   in a stable and placed in a manger.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:24.180]   Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:30.820]   And then go on and think of the poverty that was involved.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:36.500]   Joseph and Mary couldn't afford to buy a lamb to sacrifice.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.900]   They could only afford two turtle doves, the alternative that was provided by the law for
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.180]   people who were exceptionally poor.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:53.820]   And here he is, the one who has made and who owns the universe and all the riches of God
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:04.940]   and of glory in such abject poverty that they could afford nothing beyond a pair of turtle
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.940]   doves.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.260]   Watch him as he goes along.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.700]   What are the characteristics of his first coming?
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.100]   Are they not these?
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:22.100]   That he was unknown, that he was unrecognized, not truly known even by his own mother, misunderstood
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.580]   by his own brethren.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.700]   Unknown and unrecognized by the people in general, even those in the place where he
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.980]   was brought up.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.940]   And how did he spend his time in this world?
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:47.380]   Well until the age of thirty he spent his time in doing work as a carpenter.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:54.900]   A carpenter in Nazareth sharing the ordinary humdrum life with all its pettinesses and
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.020]   all that is so characteristic of life of men and women in this world.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.060]   He shared it until the age of thirty, working with his hands, the fingers that had made
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:11.340]   the universe and fashioned the stars in their orbits, making things.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.100]   A carpenter.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:22.220]   And then at the age of thirty, you remember, he set out in his public ministry.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:27.100]   And very soon he began to meet opposition.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.940]   Very soon he became familiar with hatred and envy.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.620]   Very soon he was treated with scorn and contemnation.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.620]   Oh yes, he knew opposition of the bitterest kind.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.860]   He was persecuted, he was reviled.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:51.980]   He is summed up very perfectly by Isaiah looking forward to his coming when he says, "He
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.700]   was despised and rejected of men.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.660]   His visage was marred.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.260]   There was no form nor comeliness in him, nor any beauty that could be desired."
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.860]   That's how he came.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.340]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.500]   The great God has appeared.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.020]   That's how he appeared.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.940]   That's the first coming.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.180]   And you see him weak.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.500]   And you see him tired.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.620]   You see him hungry.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   You see him weeping.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:36.180]   You see him forsaken of all, even his chosen disciples.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.900]   But that isn't all, of course.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.140]   There's something strange, there's an enigma about him.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:50.420]   Though he came like that in the way I've described, and his Godhead and his glory was veiled by
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:57.460]   the flesh, occasionally there's a flash.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.900]   He silences a storm at sea.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.340]   He says to the wind, "Peace, be still," and it obeyed him.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.260]   He can cleanse the lepers.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.700]   He can give sight to the blind.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.220]   He can raise the dead.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.220]   What is this?
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:20.580]   Oh, here are flashes of the glory, flashes of the majesty and the divinity, even through
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.940]   the veil of flesh, an occasional flash.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.140]   So his first coming is an enigma.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.180]   And men cried out, saying, "Who is this?
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:36.300]   Who is this?"
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.060]   But wait a moment, I must go on.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.700]   I haven't finished with what happened when he first came.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:50.140]   I said that he was reviled and persecuted and treated with envy and scorn and sarcasm.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.940]   I must go on to say this, that he was arrested and apparently was not able to defend himself.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940]   He was taken.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.940]   He was tried.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.500]   He was condemned.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.100]   He was dismissed.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.220]   He was taken and knurled upon a tree.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.380]   He died in weakness.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:16.020]   And angry, blasphemous men, standing at the foot of his cross, looked up at him and taunted
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:21.580]   him and said, "If thou be the Son of God, save thyself, come down."
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.260]   Others he saved himself, he cannot save.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:35.100]   Apparently defeated, baffled, utterly routed by his enemies, he died in weakness.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.140]   And they took down his body and they buried it in a grave and they rolled a stone over
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.220]   it.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:48.820]   And they go away to celebrate their victory, to rejoice in having got rid of one who had
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.460]   become a bit of a nuisance to society and especially to the government.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.460]   And there they think he's left and finished, but suddenly you remember the morning of the
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:04.020]   third day, he arose, he burst asunder the bands of death, he arose triumphant over the
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.820]   grave, the grave is empty.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:15.700]   And no, you would have thought he would give a public demonstration, but he didn't.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:27.060]   He showed himself only to certain chosen witnesses, not to the soldiers, not to Pontius Pilate,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:33.900]   not to Herod the King, not to the Pharisees and Scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.300]   law, no, no, but to a certain chosen company of witnesses.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.860]   Even in the resurrection there is a hiding, there is a veiling.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:50.460]   It happened, it's a fact, but there is a sort of concealing.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:59.100]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, and that is how it appeared.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:05.780]   The great God and Savior has come, veiled in the flesh, apparently nothing but a man,
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:10.060]   and that's what happened to him.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.020]   That was the mode or the manner of his coming.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.140]   What was the purpose of his coming?
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:22.380]   Oh, the purpose of that first coming, as the apostle makes it quite plain, was this, who
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:28.420]   gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.820]   a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.580]   Why did this great God come like this?
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.020]   What's the object of his coming into the world?
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.740]   What was the purpose behind it?
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:47.100]   It was this, to bring salvation to men and women like you and myself.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:53.820]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.100]   It was only by coming like that that he could do it.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.740]   He had to come to make atonement for sin.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.700]   Salvation means forgiveness of sins, reconciliation unto God, deliverance from the power and the
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:13.820]   tyranny of sin, the prospect of glory and everlasting joy in the presence of God.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.260]   How can it be obtained?
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.060]   How can I find salvation?
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.500]   Where can I achieve it?
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   He came like that because that was the only way whereby this salvation could ever be made
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.380]   possible.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:39.460]   This sin of man has to be punished, and if God punished your sins and mine in you and
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:46.100]   me, it would mean our everlasting death outside the presence of God and his glory.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.700]   Christ came and took them upon himself.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.540]   Yes, that's why he came veiled in the flesh.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.980]   That's why he came as a helpless babe.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   He came as a man.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.380]   As man is representative, he had to be a man.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.700]   So he became a man and took unto him human nature, and he took our sins upon him.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.340]   He submitted to baptism.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.500]   John the Baptist said, "Why do you ask me to baptize you?
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.300]   I ought to be baptized by you."
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:17.180]   "No, no," he says, "thus it cometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.780]   And so he has identified himself with us.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:29.620]   And he gave himself as a lamb to the slaughter, and God hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.620]   all.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.140]   If he had come as the Lord of glory, he couldn't have done it.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:43.420]   He laid aside his glory mild; he laid his glory by, born that man no more may die, born
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:53.060]   to give us second birth, born to raise the sons of earth.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:31:01.940]   He came down from heaven to save us, to make a way of salvation possible.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.500]   And so he had to humble himself, though he was equal with God, and thought it not robbery
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.240]   to be equal with God.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.380]   He humbled himself and made himself of no reputation.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:16.620]   Yes, even to the death of the cross.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:24.020]   He came, I say, in order to deliver us, in order to make this salvation possible.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:32.300]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, and that's how it's appeared.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.380]   That was his first coming.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.340]   And Christmas invites us to look at that.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.180]   Have you looked at it?
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.860]   Have you looked at it all?
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.460]   He didn't end as the babe of Bethlehem; he only started there.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.620]   Have you looked at that?
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.180]   Have you realized what was happening?
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:58.300]   But follow him on, go on, through the silent years, through the ministry, through the opposition,
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:04.460]   through the miracles, yes, through the death, the burial, the grave, the resurrection.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.460]   Have you looked at it all?
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:12.020]   All that has happened.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:19.380]   And this season invites us to inspect it and to survey it, to look at it, and to see, as
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:25.500]   we've never seen before, that he did all that in order that God might forgive us and
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.460]   give us a share of this great salvation.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.460]   That's the message.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.900]   No, no, the babe of Bethlehem alone doesn't save you.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.620]   It's Christ, the same person, dying upon the cross, the vials of God's wrath being poured
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.740]   upon him, and he's crying out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.020]   The one who was with God from eternity cries out.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.020]   Why?
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.020]   He's saving you.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.460]   He's making possible your salvation.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.780]   Take it as a whole, my friend.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.780]   Don't break it up.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.460]   Don't stop at Bethlehem.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.900]   See the beginning that leads to the end.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:09.500]   He came there in order that he might end here.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:16.020]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.420]   Oh, I plead with you, look back.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.700]   Look back upon it.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.260]   Gaze upon it.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.300]   Face it all, this which has happened.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.340]   It is the first message, the first call of Christmas.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.700]   But let us go on to the second call.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:44.980]   Christmas not only asks us to look backwards, it asks us equally to look forwards.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:54.500]   It not only invites us to consider the past, but as we do so, to consider also the future.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:02.460]   It incites us not only to consider what he has done, but it invites us to consider what
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:07.220]   he is yet going to do.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.980]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared, looking for that blessed hope and
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.180]   the appearance of the glory of the great God.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:22.420]   Don't stop, I say, even at his resurrection, even at his ascension, even at his heavenly
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.100]   seat at the right hand of God at this moment.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.300]   He hasn't finished yet.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.820]   He is coming again.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:35.100]   Now this is absolutely vital to a consideration of the Christian message and the Christian
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.380]   gospel.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:45.060]   God forbid that anybody in this service should stop at the first coming.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.740]   The second coming is as much a part of the gospel as is the first coming.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.300]   You can't divide Christ, I say.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.500]   You can't stop at a chosen point.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.380]   You take him as he is or not at all.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:06.220]   And all this is a part of the same grand movement of Christ in connection with our redemption.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   He redeems by coming into the world the first time, the second time.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.860]   But oh, the difference between the two comings!
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.500]   Did you notice it in the very text which I am quoting to you this evening?
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.420]   Let me apply the same analysis as I did to the first coming.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.740]   The first thing we looked at was the mode or the manner or the appearance in and of
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   itself.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.060]   Let us do the same again.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.260]   What is this?
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:50.300]   "Well," says the apostle, "it is the appearing of the glory of the great God."
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.820]   You see the contrast?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:36:02.580]   There is no greater contrast in the whole of the universe or human history than the
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:12.940]   contrast between the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.100]   Look for a moment with me at his second coming, at his second appearing.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.100]   What do you see?
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:24.300]   Well, it will be personal as the first was.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.660]   It will be visible as the first was.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:36.500]   It will be in the body as the first was.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.140]   It will not be some kind of phantom.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.220]   No, no.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.340]   It will be as visible as the first.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.900]   Do you not remember what the angels said to those apostles as they stood there on Mount
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.180]   Olivet after they had just seen him ascending into heaven?
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:37:01.300]   That same Jesus, "So show, so come, even as he has gone," said the angels.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   Very well then, what are the differences?
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.700]   Well, here are the differences.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:14.660]   It will be the appearing this time of his glory, the appearing of the glory of the great
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.740]   God.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:23.060]   No longer will the veil of flesh be there.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.900]   No longer will it be hidden.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.460]   What will it be like, says someone?
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.460]   Well, there are certain hints that we are given in the scriptures themselves.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.780]   Let me remind you of them.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.620]   The first hint of what it will be like is that which is given there on the Mount of
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.420]   Transfiguration.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:50.260]   One afternoon our Lord selected Peter and James and John and took them with him up to
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.380]   the top of a high mountain.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.700]   And there we are told that he was transfigured before them, and his arraignment became exceeding
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:03.420]   white and glistening, beyond the brightest shining, beyond anything that any fuller can
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.700]   ever achieve.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.900]   He was transfigured before them, and they saw something of his glory.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.780]   But for a passing moment they were blinded by the sight.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.740]   That gives us some hint and some conception of it.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.500]   We have got another hint with respect to it.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.940]   It was that which happened to this very man whose words we are considering the Apostle
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:40.380]   Paul when he was still Saul of Tarsus, travelling on the road to Damascus.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.180]   He had heard about this Jesus.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:48.540]   He had got a picture of him in his mind, and he reviled him and blasphemed him.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.500]   He hated him and he persecuted him.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:56.100]   This fellow, he said with the other Pharisees, "And there he is, and suddenly he sees
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:02.220]   the light in the heavens above the brightest shining of the sun, and the face and the glory
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.460]   and the marvel and the wonder."
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:10.340]   And he cries out saying, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.980]   What had he seen?
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:23.580]   He had had a glimpse of the glory of the face of Jesus Christ, and he never forgot it.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.260]   He wasn't looking at the babe in the manger.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.980]   He wasn't peeping in with the shepherds.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.380]   He wasn't going later with the wise men who offered their gifts.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.140]   No, no.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:42.500]   He wasn't looking at him as he was in the days of his flesh, veiled in flesh.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.940]   No, no.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:52.700]   He has reassumed the glory that formerly he mildly laid aside.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.820]   He is back where he was before.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:03.180]   And the Apostle had a glimpse into the face of this great God and all the glory, and it
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.300]   blinded him.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:11.660]   He fell onto his back blinded and remained blind for three days.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.220]   That will be the mood and the manner of his coming.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.220]   Listen to what he himself says about it.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.500]   This is how he put it to his own disciples.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:26.420]   He said, "You shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:33.740]   glory, and he shall send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:41.300]   Coming on the clouds of heaven accompanied by myriads of angels, so he will come in all
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.300]   his glory."
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:49.700]   Or take, if you like, the account of the Apostle Paul of what it will be like in the second
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.540]   epistle to the Thessalonians.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:57.860]   He puts it like this, "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with all his mighty
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:05.780]   angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:12.620]   gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:20.420]   the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power."
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.540]   What will he be like?
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:33.420]   Well, in the symbolism of that book of Revelation, he will be as the King of kings and the Lord
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:42.260]   of lords, shining in his majesty and all his eternal power and glory, riding the white
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:49.140]   horse of God's power with a sword and might and the armies of heaven accompanying him.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.740]   That is how he will come.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:01.180]   Can you conceive of a greater contrast?
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:07.580]   And let me emphasize one other striking contrast.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:13.820]   When he came, the first time, I say, his glory was hidden.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:22.420]   Even the glory of the resurrection was only shown to a select number of chosen witnesses.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:27.580]   The world did not see him.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.140]   But what of his second coming?
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:38.060]   This is what I am told in the first chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.660]   Every eye shall see him.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:50.820]   Every eye shall see him, yea, and they which pierced him.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.260]   This is a tremendous thing.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.740]   You may say to me, "I wish I had been alive nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.420]   I should like to have gone to Bethlehem.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.500]   I should like to have been a companion of the shepherds.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   I would have liked to look at the babe.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.340]   I would have liked just one glimpse of him.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.580]   Oh, that I had been alive when he taught and when he worked his miracles.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.020]   Oh, that I might see him as he preached.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:25.180]   Oh, that I might see him there oozing out his divine love in his blood in the garden
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.140]   of Gethsemane and dying upon the cross.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:34.940]   Oh, that I might see him risen from the grave, leaving the grave clothes behind, appearing
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.740]   suddenly in the midst of the disciples.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.380]   Oh, that I might have seen him.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.860]   Oh, that I might have been with Peter and James and John.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.140]   I'd have felt like them.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.380]   I'd have said, "Let us make tabernacles.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.380]   Stay here.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.020]   I want to enjoy the glory."
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.140]   But I haven't seen him.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:59.500]   But my dear friend, you shall see him.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.860]   Every eye shall see him.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.700]   This is a part of the message of Christmas.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.500]   You can't see the babe.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.260]   He was once like that, but never again.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:19.900]   He's the Lord of glory, and thus he will appear, the puring of the glory of the great God.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.260]   That's how he'll come.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.860]   That is the mood and the manner.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   And what will be the purpose?
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:33.580]   It will be this, to bring to an end the day of grace, to bring to an end the offer of
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:40.700]   the gospel with its free pardon and forgiveness and reconciliation and sonship.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.740]   All that will be brought to an end.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.580]   The day of grace will be terminated.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.820]   Time itself will be ended.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:57.420]   Why will he come back again looking for that blessed hope and the appearance of the glory
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.060]   of the great God?
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.500]   What's he coming back for?
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.740]   He's coming back to judge.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:11.340]   The judgment of the world has been committed into his hands because he came that first
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:18.220]   time, because the whole of the affairs of men have been put into his hands.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:24.500]   And so he is the judge, and he will come and judge the world in righteousness.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:29.380]   Every man, every woman, every child who's ever lived will appear before him.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.700]   The books will be opened.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.400]   He will judge the nations.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:41.220]   He will judge the whole universe.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:49.940]   And then he will destroy all his enemies, all who haven't believed in him, all who
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:57.140]   have rejected him, all who have ignored him, all who have spurned the offer of his love
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.180]   and of his grace.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.380]   He's given long years, nearly two thousand years have gone.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.540]   He's given the time that men might repent and believe.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:15.020]   All who haven't will be destroyed out of his presence for all eternity.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:23.980]   He will come to judge and to destroy his enemies, but he will come for another reason, looking,
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.820]   says Paul, for that blessed hope.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.220]   What is the blessed hope?
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:39.620]   The blessed hope is this, a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:45.660]   A day that shall come when this world will be no longer as it is now.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.300]   Sin and evil and shame and all that is wrong will have gone.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.140]   It will all be taken and cast into a lake of perdition.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.940]   The world will be purged and purified.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.980]   The heavens, the very elements will melt with a fervent heat.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:06.940]   And all that we see and that depresses us and drags us down will be destroyed forever
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:13.300]   out of the presence of God and out of the presence of God's people.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:26.500]   The blessed hope, a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:34.780]   And all who have believed in him and who belong to him will be there with him, changed into
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:40.540]   his image, glorified even as he is glorified.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   Even these bodies of ours that are diseased and weak and are decaying, even these renewed,
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:53.200]   renovated, perfect, glorious in beauty and in form and in everything else.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.340]   We shall see him and we shall be like him.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.460]   Blessed hope.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:04.580]   That is what he's going to come back for.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:12.300]   And the message of Christmas is a message which tells us this, that as certainly as
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:20.940]   he came the first time, he will come the second time.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.820]   He wasn't expected when he came the first time.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.660]   He will not be expected the second time.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.500]   And men and women won't believe the message as they didn't believe it then.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.980]   They ignored the prophets.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.180]   They ignore them now.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.340]   They'll go on eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:46.220]   They'll be exactly, says the Lord himself, as they were in the days of Noah, in the days
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:52.260]   of the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.620]   the flood came and took them all away.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:05.300]   Even so, will it be in the days of the Son of Man?
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:13.380]   But though the foolish, sinful world doesn't believe it, it makes no difference.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.060]   He has come.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:26.860]   He will come in all his majesty and glory, full revealed.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.260]   And every eye shall see him.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.140]   You will see him.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:39.540]   You who haven't believed in him, you who have rejected him, you who have never seen your
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:45.700]   need of him, you who have said he's just a man, you who have clung to your darling sins
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:51.860]   rather than give yourself to him, you will see him.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:57.780]   And see what you've refused.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.180]   See what you've rejected.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:06.060]   See your blindness and your madness.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:15.580]   But my dear friend, can it be that you will be in that state and condition?
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:24.980]   I ask you again, I plead with you, on this Sunday evening before Christmas Day, look
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:30.340]   back, look back.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:42.380]   In order to save you from judgment and perdition, he has already come as a little babe, has
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:52.500]   taken on your flesh, has lived a life in this cruel, sinful world, and has gone deliberately
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:59.820]   to the cross to suffer for your sins and for your shame.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.380]   Look at him.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.940]   Look back at him.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:03.940]   Consider him.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:08.380]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.420]   I ask you, have you seen him?
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.340]   Look at him.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   Contemplate him.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.340]   Survey him.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.340]   Stay there.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:22.180]   Believe on him and give yourself to him.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:30.180]   And then as I ask you to look forward, you won't do it with fear, nor with terror, nor
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.100]   with alarm.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.620]   But you will say, "I am looking for it.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.020]   I am longing for it.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:43.740]   For to me it is the blessed hope and the appearance of the glory of the great God.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.980]   I want to see him as he is.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.580]   I shall see him.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:56.580]   And I shall spend my eternity with him in that new earth, under the new heaven.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:01.620]   Oh, blessed hope, come quickly.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.620]   Look back.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.620]   Look forward.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:11.540]   Look at him as a whole and give yourself to him.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.460]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
