[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, live Q&A.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.040]   Interesting time to be doing a live Q&A.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040]   Let's go.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:25.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.080]   Today is Friday, March 13, 2020, and today we do live Q&A.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.040]   These are live call-in shows, just like live talk radio.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   You get to hear them about an hour after I record them.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   So today should be fun.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.520]   Lots of things to talk about on today's show.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   Let's get started.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   These shows are open to patrons of the show, those who support the show at Patreon, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.680]   If you would like to join these shows, I do them every single Friday when I can arrange
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.760]   the technology.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.360]   So they're not every Friday, but whenever I can arrange the technology to get a good
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.120]   recording, that's when I do these shows.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.960]   And this is usually your very best way.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.900]   If you'd like to talk with me about a subject, if you'd like to discuss something that you're
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.160]   thinking about on your end, this is one of the best ways to do it.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.360]   Usually I get everybody in.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.540]   So if you're not currently a patron of the show, I would deeply appreciate your support

[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So if you're not currently a patron of the show, I would deeply appreciate your support
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.620]   with is money.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.700]   Obviously, if you knew that you were going to be purchasing your rental house in a few
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.120]   years, you would begin by planning for the money and that includes saving money.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.460]   That especially includes attention to your credit score, making sure that that's as high
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.520]   as possible, making sure that everything is squared away for the financing of the enterprise.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   You want to think carefully through your financing strategy and then when you think through your
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.240]   financing strategy, you want to consider what is necessary at a certain time.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.640]   For example, as we record this on Friday, March 13, 2020, mortgage rates have recently
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.920]   gone down and they're going down a good bit.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   Who knows how low they will go?
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.280]   We live in very interesting times at the moment.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000]   But that's the kind of thing that I would be watching very, very carefully.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.440]   When it comes to my two-year time horizon, I would be watching the different things that
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   are involved with those mortgage rates to make sure that I have the ability to lock
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.000]   in a mortgage at the best rates.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.680]   Two years is close enough to start paying attention to all those details.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.560]   Saving money, getting out of debt, two years is enough time to get out of debt if you have
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   any debt, two years is enough time to make major improvements in your credit score.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.680]   But obviously, squaring away the financing is thing number one.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   You can't go wrong with having extra money.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.640]   When you move on from there, when you talk about living overseas but being willing to
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.520]   invest anywhere in the United States, that brings out an even more interesting option.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.820]   That's not the kind of thing that many people think about.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.400]   Most people approach a rental market just simply because that's where they live.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   And then it becomes fairly simple.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.200]   And I think that's a sensible way to do it.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.400]   You say, "Here's where I live.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.540]   I want to manage the properties locally."
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.540]   In your case, I would want to start digging into some of the different markets around
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.540]   the United States.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.000]   There are some markets in which you really can do very well as a landlord.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   And there are some markets in which it's not so easy to do well as a landlord.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.920]   If you've got the whole country available to you, you have some very interesting options.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.600]   So some things that I would start to think about.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.440]   Is yield more interesting to you and more helpful?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.660]   Or is appreciation more interesting and more helpful?
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.320]   Your answer to that question will depend on whether you need more money now and you're
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.680]   looking for yield or whether you are just looking for long-term capital gains.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.260]   And so that will start to drive you in one direction of the market versus another.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.840]   That might yield, it will usually drive you down market because you'll often get higher
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.220]   yields on lower cost properties.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.360]   Appreciation will probably drive you up market a little bit.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.680]   If you're not so worried about the current yield and you want more long-term appreciation,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.800]   then again you probably won't be at the bottom end of the market.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.400]   So I would think carefully through my strategy on yield versus appreciation.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.720]   If you're going for yield, then you've got to think through what's the most intelligent
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   way for you to get that yield.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   If you're overseas, you're going to face some challenges of managing with management costs.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.160]   Who's going to manage it for you?
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   How good of a job are they going to do?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.480]   And so whereas you might get, if you're local and let's say you've got $200,000 to invest,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   a lot of times you'll get more yield on that $200,000 if you buy four different $50,000
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   properties.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.560]   But that's also going to be a much more intense management scenario.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.380]   You're generally going to have harder to manage tenants at the lower end of the market.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.320]   You're generally going to have more turnover.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.080]   You're generally going to have more involvement in the property at that end of the market.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   If you're going to be overseas, you very well could be able to buy a property that you could
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.960]   manage yourself by going up market.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.560]   Perhaps a standard suburban home, a $200,000 home would be the kind of house where you
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.960]   could easily bring in a professional couple with children who would be low maintenance
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   tenants.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.040]   You could create a low hassle landlording scenario where you incentivize them to take care of
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.340]   all the smaller problems in the property in exchange for a discount on the rent.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:45.320]   You could screen for higher quality candidates and that would possibly be more interesting
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.500]   to you and more helpful to you to get just a steady paycheck.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.240]   Even just things like managing the logistics.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.160]   If you're at the lower end of the market, yeah you might have more yield but now you've
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.340]   got people paying you money in cash which for you being overseas might be very inconvenient.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.540]   If you go up market, you probably can get somebody who you can arrange an electronic
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.100]   payment system and that will lower your hassle and your frustration.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.840]   Now once you get an idea of the type of property that you're looking for based on your investment
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.620]   objectives, once you get an idea of the amount of money that you have, then in two years
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.980]   I would be going to some discussion boards online.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.460]   I'd be talking to real estate agents and I'd be talking and researching which markets in
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.820]   the country would be the most interesting for your investment goals.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.300]   There's a big difference between San Francisco versus Kansas City versus Youngstown, Ohio
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.220]   versus Miami, Florida.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.040]   These markets are so dramatically different and what I would try to do is I would try
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:54.860]   to find some investment stories that make sense to me based upon what I want and what
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.140]   I think local markets are going to do.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.980]   So probably you would want to choose a city in a growing region.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.660]   The trend is generally from smaller towns and from rural areas into the cities and so
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.860]   I'd probably want to be looking at a city.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.740]   I'd want to look at a city that has good long-term prospects, a good economic base and a city
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.100]   which is fairly valued.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.820]   Now I don't know exactly where that city is.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.300]   I could throw out some cities but I think that that would be, I don't want to do that
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:29.380]   here in this context but I would be talking to some people online, talking to local investors,
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.100]   finding, leveraging the internet to join local real estate investment groups, etc. and trying
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.140]   to get a sense from local investors what the markets are.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.180]   Just giving an example, in South Florida it's very hard right now to make properties cash
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.460]   flow.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.240]   The prices are high, rents are high but it's hard to make them cash flow.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.260]   That's not the same in other markets and so you got to find those markets where the cash
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.620]   flow is available.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.220]   And so once you lay out your investment objectives then I would go to the internet and I'd start
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.740]   looking around to find the good markets that have the good fundamentals that will fit your
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.060]   investment objective.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.900]   And then over the course of the next two years what I would do is I would get myself on a
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   bunch of lists.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.860]   I would start watching properties, start doing my best to get a good idea of what's available
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.860]   in those markets so that when you get to the point where you're ready to buy you're pretty
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.780]   comfortable with what's been happening.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.180]   Now I'm going to go out on a ledge here and do some prognostication which of course could
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.820]   turn out to be wrong but I think right now is a wonderful time for you to be doing that
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.260]   legwork.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.140]   At the moment I don't see how the United States avoids recession at the moment.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.740]   At the moment, although I'd love to wait a little bit more time before being super confident
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.700]   in these opinions, at the moment I don't see how the United States doesn't avoid recession.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.740]   I don't see how we don't have a serious increase in unemployment and widespread financial problems
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.220]   coming up in the coming months and probably years.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.780]   And I think on the backside of it there should be some real estate deals available.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.260]   So I think your two-year timeline if you've got cash right now your two-year timeline
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.500]   is an excellent time for you to be looking around and be watching for properties.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.620]   And so I would be investing my time heavily right now into creating my strategy, starting
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.060]   to watch markets and waiting to see if once we start to get into recession and towards
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.060]   the back end of recession waiting for those real estate deals to start to emerge.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.000]   They're not there yet.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.180]   Everything is completely in disarray at the moment but I expect them to be there in a
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.180]   year or so.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   So we'll see.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.660]   We'll come back in a year and we'll see how good my prognostication is but that's my opinion
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.660]   at the moment.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.660]   Go ahead, Mark.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.660]   Excellent.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.660]   Thank you.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.660]   That's super helpful.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:50.100]   So in terms of money preparing that, one question I want to ask is how to think through whether
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.420]   or not I should be contributing to retirement savings while saving that down payment.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.460]   So quick background, I make about $4,000 a month.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.660]   Currently I'm saving about 15% of that for retirement and saving around $500 a month.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.500]   So I don't know the percentage but saving around $500 a month for a down payment.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:18.220]   Now that doesn't get super far and so unfortunately we've chosen for my wife and I a career that
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.940]   has we think high social impact but unlikely to change dramatically financially.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:30.960]   And so I'm trying to think through the best way to be able to save up down payment.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.760]   So a couple specific questions on that.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.060]   So first, how to think through whether or not I should be contributing to retirement
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.180]   savings Roth IRAs, that kind of thing.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.020]   What percentage if at all versus saving up for a down payment?
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   If I were in your shoes, I believe that there is more potential benefit financially, just
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.900]   speaking generally.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:02.780]   There's more potential benefit for you to invest in rental real estate early in your
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:09.020]   life rather than investing in mutual funds inside of a retirement plan.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.100]   Now I need to for the sake of academic clarity, I need to point out that you could invest
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.860]   in rental real estate inside of a retirement plan.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.240]   That's doable, it's a little bit more complex and if you have not yet accumulated a lot
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.580]   of money, it's just going to be more complex.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.900]   So I think that's a better fit for somebody who has accumulated significant assets in
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.620]   a retirement plan.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.980]   But I don't get the sense that you're there yet as far as really significant assets.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:43.580]   And so what I would say is if I were in your shoes, I would stop investing into retirement
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.220]   accounts until I accumulated the down payment.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.500]   I would do the transaction, buy the property and then I would come back and start investing
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.420]   in the retirement plan again.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:04.540]   But if you have a plan, I would say if I had to wait five years on investing into retirement
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:11.100]   accounts, but I in the meantime bought five properties, the leveraging, the safe leverage
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.220]   that can be accomplished in those real estate properties, especially if they're well chosen,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.420]   etc., is in my opinion generally going to be superior to what you can get inside of
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.420]   a retirement account.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   That's excellent advice.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   Thank you.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   Thank you.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   That's helpful.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:34.340]   Related to that, we've got about 58,000 currently fully invested in stocks within
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.480]   our Roths.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.460]   Part of our thinking was that we could potentially pull that to pay for a down payment.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.260]   So there's two specific questions related to that.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:50.320]   First, is it possible to pull from a Roth for a rental house down payment, not your
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.300]   own primary residence down payment?
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:03.820]   And then secondly, would you continue just putting the down payment funds in a Roth IRA
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.980]   so you have options, you can maybe build up some, it'd be a small amount of growth,
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.540]   but you pull out the contributions and the growth remains.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.660]   Would you use that as a vehicle for a down payment at all?
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.280]   Is that something worth doing or just leave it in a money market account?
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:28.840]   There is no possible – so when you are contributing in IRAs, there are a number of reasons why
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:35.080]   you can take the money out of an IRA prior to age 59 and a half without incurring the
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.960]   tax penalty.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.000]   None of those involve your taking out money to purchase a rental house.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.480]   So the answer to your first question is no.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.880]   You cannot take money out of the Roth IRA as a qualified exception in order to purchase
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.600]   a rental house.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:57.040]   What you can always do is you can always remove the contributions from the Roth IRA.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:03.000]   If your current account balance is $58,000 but over the years you've made a total of
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.880]   $45,000 of contributions, that means that if you could take out $45,000 with no tax
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.040]   penalties leaving $13,000 in the account, there would be no taxes due, there are no
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:21.440]   tax consequences, and you could use that $45,000 for your down payment.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.400]   So in light of that, the answer to your second question is obviously yes.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.280]   There's no reason for you – if you're limited on the amount of money that you can put aside,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.640]   there's no reason for you not to accumulate the money in your Roth IRA knowing that you
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.580]   can take it out in two years.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.800]   You just obviously wouldn't want to invest it into stocks or into anything volatile.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.880]   You'd want to keep it in a cash account or cash equivalent so it was stable for you to
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.240]   use for a rental property.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.880]   So what I would do is I would split the difference.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.640]   I would put the money into the Roth IRA knowing that I could use it as a down payment.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.920]   But then what I would do is work really hard over the next few years to save other money
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:06.680]   outside of it and/or to find another source of financing for the down payment, negotiate
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.360]   that in some other way so that I could do both, so I could buy the rental property while
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.600]   simultaneously leaving the money in the Roth IRA along the way.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.800]   So that's how I would handle it.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   All right, last question, Mark.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.560]   Got a bunch of other callers, so go with your final question.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.560]   Mark Miller That's fine.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.880]   Let me look at this real quick.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.180]   So I'll put it this way.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.080]   What books would you recommend or podcasts to listen to?
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.680]   I have John Reed's Getting Started in Real Estate Investing, The Building Wealth One
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.960]   House at a Time you recommended, as well as John Shaw's Landlording Course.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.800]   The BiggerPockets podcast are also on my radar screen.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.600]   Any other specific resources you'd recommend?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.320]   Tavish I don't have any other resources other than
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   those.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.240]   Those are my favorite go-to sources would be John Shaw, John Reed, and then the BiggerPockets
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.120]   community is great.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   There's nothing there.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:03.720]   I would say probably to round that out, the best thing is going to be to find locals in
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.360]   the market and to find people who are going to mentor you.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.080]   To round out your reading, I would recommend, was it Cliff Atkinson's?
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.400]   No, it's a different guy.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.600]   The guy who wrote the book Asset Protection for Real Estate Investors.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   He's an attorney, but he has a book.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.800]   It's called Asset Protection for Real Estate Investors and I like that book.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.080]   I think that would be a good thing to do because when you start, go ahead and read about your
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.600]   thoughts on how you would actually go around investing, how you go around setting up your
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.400]   asset protection plan from the beginning because it's easier to do it right from the beginning.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:45.200]   It's a little complex because you're managing obviously your investments, you're managing
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.640]   how you're going to do the financing.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.280]   It's a little bit complex, but that's one thing that you could do easily is engage in
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   your reading.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   All right.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   Thanks for calling in, Mark.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.600]   Call back next week with more questions and we'll go on to Shiv.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   Shiv, welcome to the show.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   Hey, Josh.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.920]   Firstly, thanks for making this platform available.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.040]   I'm considering refinancing my mortgage to benefit from the lower rates.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   So far I have paid down mortgage aggressively.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.680]   So this refinance, if I go ahead with it, it will free up good cash flow to the tune
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   of like $1,000.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:25.240]   But I don't want to just go ahead and refi without good plans at hand to use that money.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.840]   And that's where I want to pick your brain on like in current scenario, what do you feel
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.760]   are the best ways to utilize extra cash flow?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.120]   So you're thinking about keeping the balance of the mortgage where it is now and just simply
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.360]   lowering your payments by refinancing at a lower rate and stretching them out?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.320]   Or you're thinking about doing a cash out refinance where you take equity from the home
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.760]   and put it into a bank account?
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.600]   No, not the first one.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   Okay.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.480]   So what do you, what are you currently investing in and what do you think you should invest
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.160]   in?
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:03.400]   So I have 401k and other.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.160]   So right now I'm pretty stretched between mortgage and 401k.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:14.040]   I invest about 15% of my income towards 401k and rest all towards mortgage.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.280]   I don't have any room other than that.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   Are you maxing out your 401k?
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.840]   Yes, I am.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.260]   So if you're maxing out your 401k, that's done.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.640]   Now you could think about maxing other accounts.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.240]   If you qualify for a Roth IRA, you could max that out.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.360]   If you have, if you qualify for a health savings account, an HSA, that would be a wise account
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   to fund.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.840]   I'm happy with your funding those three accounts.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:47.400]   And I think that if you max out those three accounts, either a traditional 401k or a traditional
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.720]   401k, a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income, if you don't qualify a backdoor Roth IRA is
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.760]   fine and then a health savings account.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.640]   I like all three of those accounts and I think if you max those out, those are good uses
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640]   of the money.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.800]   They're all flexible in different ways and as long as you're thoughtful with your investments,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.320]   that gives you some options.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:13.640]   Now from there, then I should clarify first, do you have cash savings, a substantial amount
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.640]   of cash savings?
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   Yes, I do.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   Okay.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.000]   So you want to make sure you have a substantial amount of cash savings and then from there,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.840]   I would go to other investment classes.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.200]   I don't see any reason why somebody of a normal age needs more money in stocks than what they
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.240]   can accumulate inside of their 401k, their IRA, etc.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.960]   As I was just talking about the previous caller, if you don't own rental real estate, I don't
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.600]   know this for a fact, my opinion is just the same as anyone else's, but I think there are
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.880]   probably going to be some buying opportunities in rental real estate in the next couple of
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.880]   years.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.400]   So if I woke up in your shoes, if I were at all interested in owning real estate or investing
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.600]   in real estate, I would be stockpiling as much cash as I could with preparation for
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.280]   buying in the next year or two.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.520]   Now we don't know if that will happen or not, but that would be one thing that I would be
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.900]   doing is just stockpiling cash ready to buy rental real estate.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.320]   Do you own any hard assets?
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   Do you own any gold?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.360]   Do you own any other alternative investments like that?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   No.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.200]   So with some of the money, I would purchase some hard assets.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.600]   I think everybody should have in their portfolio some modest amount of hard assets, something
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:33.200]   in the range of 5 to 10% of your net worth I think is reasonable.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.680]   So I would put some money towards that and just start steadily moving in that direction.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   That'll help you.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.840]   And then from there, basically the world is up to you.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.120]   There are only three basic asset classes that you can invest in and they are an active business,
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.880]   real property, and paper assets.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.160]   But within those three classes, there are huge variations that you can do.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.360]   If you are interested in entrepreneurship or have any idea of an active business that
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.200]   you're interested in, I'm convinced that's going to be your highest financial possibility.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.120]   So what I would do, given that I'm interested in entrepreneurship and I like the lifestyle
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.360]   components, I would use the freed up cash flow to allow me to pursue any business opportunity
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.960]   that I were interested in.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.840]   If I looked around and saw that I can drop my mortgage payment from $2,000 a month to
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.640]   $1,000 a month by refinancing, I would just stockpile cash until I found a business that
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.460]   I wanted to be involved in.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:39.440]   That business can be as mundane as a pizza franchise or it can be as exotic as a horse
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.520]   farm in the country.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.680]   It can be anything that you want, but your biggest profit opportunities are going to
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.240]   come from business.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.720]   And so I'm always going to make sure I have enough money to start businesses and/or to
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.800]   invest in businesses when I find an opportunity that appeals to me.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.480]   With regard to real property, there's an unlimited number of types of investments that you could
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.800]   make and this will come down to your skill and your interest.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.920]   Most people with real property, and I'm blurring the use of that, usually real property is
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.440]   simply defined as land and things that are connected to land.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   That's fine.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.720]   So you can invest in land.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.360]   You can invest in houses and that can be anywhere in the world.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.600]   It can be any kind of investment.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.080]   But when I think about real property, I don't use it in the strict sense.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.440]   I just think about it in terms of physical investments.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.760]   So you could buy RVs that you rent out to private clients on the weekend who want to
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.080]   rent those RVs from you.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.120]   That can be very productive.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.760]   You can buy used cars and flip used cars.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.520]   You can buy guns and flip guns or you can build guns.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:50.000]   You can go and buy AR-15 lowers and assemble AR-15s and sell them.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.640]   You can buy gold coins.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.360]   You can invest in a diamond mine.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.960]   It's any kind of real asset that you are interested in investing in.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.480]   Stamps, baseball cards, computers.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.760]   There's classic automobiles.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:11.880]   Anything that you're interested in or anything that you want to develop an interest in is
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.200]   worth pursuing.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.840]   So that would be real property.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.540]   Then with regard to paper assets, the standard approach to paper assets is clearly stocks
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.020]   and bonds and mutual funds and things that are inside your 401(k).
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.680]   But recognize that there's no limit to the kind of paper assets that you can do.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.000]   You can trade derivatives contracts.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.540]   You can learn how to trade options.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.060]   You can play in the Forex markets if you want to develop an interest in that.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.160]   You can invest in dividend paying stocks.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.900]   The world of options is there's no limit to it.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.520]   And so what I'd recommend is if you don't have specific things that you're interested
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   in.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.300]   I have specific areas of investments that I'm interested in.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.600]   If you don't have that, then the first thing you should do with the freed up cash flow
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.160]   is start visiting bookstores and start browsing bookstores, both digital and local, and just
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.600]   start sampling books.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.580]   And if you bought a hundred books on investing and browsed through them and got exposed to
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.300]   all the different ideas, then you would start to be drawn in one direction or another.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.720]   So I'll give you just for me.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.040]   I'm not interested in options.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.480]   I thought I was.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.520]   When I was younger, I was interested in options.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.720]   Somebody wrote me an email this morning and said, "Can I hire you to consult with me on
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   options?"
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.080]   And I wrote him back and said, "No, I'm not interested.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.960]   I don't have any expertise.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.520]   It's not of interest to me."
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.860]   But there are people who really love the idea of trading options contracts.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.960]   And so you can make plenty of money in that if you become an expert and you learn what
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.080]   you're doing.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.200]   But you'll find that you resonate with certain things where you don't resonate with those
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.320]   other things.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.040]   And so that's the important thing for you to look around and find those things that
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.680]   you resonate with.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.320]   In the meantime, don't be scared just to save cash.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.800]   There's no reason not to save cash.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.440]   And what will happen is when you start to pile up cash, even if it's hundreds of thousands
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.480]   of dollars, that's fine.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.880]   But start to see opportunities available to you because you're now in a place where you
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.560]   have plenty of cash on the sidelines and then you can wait patiently for a really good deal.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   >> It makes sense.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   Thank you so much.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   >> My pleasure.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.480]   All right, move on to looks like Jordan.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   How can I serve you today?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   >> Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:27.560]   I have a question about transitioning from a main career over to side hustles.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.680]   So right now I have a very lucrative main career, but I also have two side hustles of
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.960]   teaching at a college as well as a YouTube channel.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.480]   And while those are far from being full-fledged careers, I'm trying to look forward in the
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:51.440]   next year or two and decide when it is responsible to kind of commit more time to those, specifically
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:59.520]   my YouTube channel, to make that a more long-term source of income, if that makes sense.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   >> Yes.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.480]   Do you think that your two alternative careers of teaching and YouTube channel, do you think
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:14.280]   that they have a higher income potential than your current lucrative career?
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.440]   >> Teaching by itself, probably not.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   And YouTube, maybe together they could equal what I'm doing now.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.240]   The answer is no, it would definitely be more of a lifestyle and passion element making
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.720]   up for that difference.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.100]   >> And how much are you earning in your current, how much is lucrative?
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.200]   What does that mean to you?
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.440]   >> Right now I'm making about $130 a year.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.480]   >> Great, congratulations.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.420]   So my first question, or my first area of analysis would come down to what is the financial
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.280]   potential of these opportunities?
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   That will help you to understand where they will fall into your decision making.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.080]   Now I don't think that you always have to pursue the most lucrative thing that's available
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   to you.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.640]   In fact, I think that'd be very unwise.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:14.780]   So if you said, I'm making $130,000 now, but I have this other thing that I want to do
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:23.060]   that I'm really interested and keen on doing, but it has a maximum income potential of $60,000,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.380]   I'm not saying don't do it.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.780]   But by being aware of that, it will help you make a strategic decision.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:36.740]   That will be a very different decision making process than if your side hustle has an income
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.700]   potential of $260,000.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.000]   And that will make a bigger difference as to how long, how you pursue it.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.880]   So think first carefully and try to get an estimate of what you think the income potential
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.120]   is.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:58.340]   Now with YouTube, if you are, so teaching is interesting because teaching can be extremely
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.340]   lucrative.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   I'm a teacher.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.340]   I consider myself a teacher.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.780]   If I am asked what my job is, I say I'm a teacher.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   That's what I do.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.460]   And I love to teach.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.880]   I can happily teach in any context.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:15.900]   If everything crumbled today and I went and got a job teaching high school, I would love
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   that.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.940]   It would be a lifestyle for me that would be, I would be thrilled with it.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.380]   And I have a half a dozen subjects that I would just enjoy teaching.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:30.080]   But teaching isn't in and of itself a commitment to poverty.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.820]   You don't have to teach in a non-lucrative way.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.940]   You can take that and teach in a few different ways.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.400]   But of course teaching is more predictable as a career because it is so standardized
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   in the marketplace.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.740]   You can look and see how much a local community college pays you.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.100]   You can see how much a university pays you.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.500]   You can see how much a government high school pays you.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.260]   You can see how much a private high school pays you.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.740]   And you can get an idea of what they make.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.340]   And there's not a lot of variability in those types of institutions.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.140]   But you can also take a teaching career and you can amplify it.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.380]   So you can get a job as a professor at a local university while simultaneously writing books,
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:12.340]   developing a global brand, selling huge amounts of product to other people, and you can use
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.620]   teaching as the foundation for doing it.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.540]   Probably one of the most successful versions of that that I have seen in the past few years
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:24.620]   would be the Canadian professor Jordan Peterson, who was about five years ago or a little bit
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:29.380]   more, he was just a standard professor at the University of Toronto.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.100]   Well fast forward, he went through a number of events that were politically poignant and
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.220]   he developed a large reputation.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.260]   And he went from working as a standard professor at a Canadian university to developing a public
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.740]   education platform, speaking to tens of millions of people, and making tens of thousands of
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.740]   dollars per month.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.740]   I forget, but prior, at the very minimum, no, not counting book sales, not counting
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.580]   anything else, but just simply at a minimum, when he was using the platform Patreon, I
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.100]   think he was earning $60,000 a month from his Patreon supporters.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.040]   Now clearly that is not common.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:12.020]   But I use that as an example to say teaching does not have to be a sentence to poverty.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.580]   Teaching can serve as a foundation and it can buttress your expertise.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.060]   And then if you're thoughtful and strategic about how you use that, it can be something
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.340]   that becomes very lucrative.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.640]   Now YouTube is also interesting because generally YouTube is a sentence to poverty.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.380]   The vast majority of YouTube creators will never make enough money on their work in order
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.940]   to support themselves, let alone grow well, become wealthy.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.740]   But that doesn't mean that YouTube can't be leveraged effectively.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.060]   And so if you've, if you have been successful in establishing a brand that is starting to
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.500]   achieve something, then you can think about how you could leverage it.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.980]   And certainly with YouTube, similar to teaching, although YouTube in and of itself is a very
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.740]   poor money-making idea.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:01.020]   For example, if your dream is to become a massive YouTube creator and make millions
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.520]   on YouTube AdSense revenue, that's extremely unlikely, very difficult, very unlikely.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.980]   But even with a modest YouTube platform, you can leverage that platform as a marketing
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:19.180]   arm for other much more profitable products, services, et cetera, ways to serve your clients.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:25.740]   And even a modest YouTube platform can be a very effective way to build a business.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.100]   So both of those do have financial potential.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.500]   And if you think about that, it will start to make your, it'll start to make your transition
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   clearer.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   With my story, I was, I had a highly lucrative career.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:44.100]   I knew when I left that highly lucrative career that I was going to take a serious pay cut,
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:55.420]   but I could design a business in my head that had such a much higher potential of lucrative,
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:01.200]   it was, had so much higher earning potential with a better lifestyle that I didn't mind
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.600]   taking the dip.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.500]   So that's, it's just different if you're, and that's where you start your analysis.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.500]   So that's the first one.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:15.820]   Now, the second thing is this, do you need time that you don't currently have available
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.380]   because of your day job?
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.420]   Do you need time?
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:26.940]   Is time the limiting factor for you to develop your side hustles further?
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   It certainly is limiting.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:35.740]   So with YouTube, I completely agree that AdSense is not the way to get rich off that.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.580]   And I am toying with a few business ideas around that since it is a very niche market
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:47.100]   and I do think there's potential there, but currently I have a seven month old day job
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   and two side hustles.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.480]   So yeah, I've got a little bit going on.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:34:00.900]   So I can only produce about one quality video a week and understanding to like, to capitalize
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.220]   on the momentum I'm seeing right now, I really would like that to be up to two videos.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.300]   Now it doesn't necessarily need to be that.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.100]   It could grow more slowly and maybe if I just like cut out friends or family, I could make
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.100]   that happen.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.180]   But that's part of what I'm warring with right now.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.380]   If money were not an object, if I said to you, you have to do some kind of work and
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.620]   you're going to make the same money regardless, would you quickly leave your day job and move
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.700]   to building these side hustle businesses?
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   In a second, yes.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   Okay.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.400]   So that to me makes your decision clear.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.180]   It's not a matter of if you're going to make the move, it's a matter of when it makes sense
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.700]   for you to make the move, which is clearly the question that you asked, but it does,
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.460]   it is important to clarify it.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:47.940]   Now the reason I talk about time, there are some businesses that if you invest more hours,
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.260]   you can make them more productive.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:57.260]   I caution you to really carefully analyze whether you actually need more time or whether
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.160]   you need to use your time more efficiently.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.540]   What I've discovered is often I'm far more focused and far more productive when I don't
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:12.060]   have the time available because I just got to make it work than I am when I have all
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.260]   the time in the world.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.540]   Even with my current business, I put a lot of time into it.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.820]   But what I find is if I'm not stretched for time, I don't actually produce more, I produce
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.820]   less.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.580]   It's much easier for me to sit around and waste time on the internet and justify it
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.460]   to myself while I'm doing research.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.820]   But realistically, if I had an hour set aside, then I'd only had it, I would get the work
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.820]   done.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.980]   And so what I found for me is being busy is actually more important and I'm more productive
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.040]   when I'm busy with multiple projects than if I'm productive with just one thing.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.880]   And you might find the same thing to be true.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.960]   If you lost your day job or left your day job, you would quickly move to working on
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.120]   your side hustles, but now you might be much more relaxed about those side hustles and
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.680]   that wouldn't be great.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.120]   But if you do need more time to be productive, then I think it makes sense to start investing
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.160]   into that time and to putting yourself in a situation where you're actually going to
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.320]   be making use of it.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.720]   So that's the time question.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.120]   Now, next question.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.720]   Do you need money from these side hustles in order to give you the permission to leave?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.120]   >>Kate: Yeah, at this point, I'm primary earner in our family.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   My husband is also an engineer, so it's not like we're dealing with low income there.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:34.440]   But as it sits right now, yes, there would need to be some financial component to these
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.040]   to just keep the household running.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.200]   >>Dave: Could you guys live on his income?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.280]   >>Kate: Not with...
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.200]   We have one in daycare now and then as we expand our family, it would be very unfeasible.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.240]   >>Dave: Could you live on his income plus what you're already making with teaching and
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   YouTube?
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:02.040]   >>Kate: Not this year, but potentially within the next year or two.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.520]   That's a reasonable horizon, yeah.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.680]   >>Dave: Do you have enough savings that you could live on savings and his income for a
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.400]   year or two until you could make enough income from the business to live on that?
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.280]   >>Kate: Close to it, yeah.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   >>Dave: Okay.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   Have you calculated what your actual expenses would change, for example, with taxes, payroll
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   taxes, etc.?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.240]   Have you calculated whether you could actually live on his income right now if you quit your
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   job?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.320]   >>Kate: I haven't taken taxes into account, but yes, I have looked at our expenses right
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.920]   now and what's left of his, but not taking into account taxes.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:47.840]   >>Dave: Well, if you leave your current lucrative job, how easily could you reenter it in three
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.000]   years if you came to find out that it was a mistake for you to leave in the first place?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.040]   >>Kate: That's one of the sticky points that maybe I should have brought to light earlier
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.560]   on in this conversation.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.080]   It would be quite difficult.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.840]   Part of the value in my position right now is that I deal with bleeding edge technology.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:16.120]   I always say in about six months without investment in keeping up with trends and setting aside
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.400]   time to code and build out infrastructure, my value greatly diminishes.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.960]   Now, not all the way, but I would definitely come back into the field probably at a much
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   lower income.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   It would be disruptive.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.360]   It wouldn't be disastrous.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.520]   >>Dave: Even if you weren't fully employed in the field, could you design some kind of
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.040]   backup plan that allowed you to stay current without a job?
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.840]   Could you stay current in the field just through self-study?
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.440]   >>Kate: Yeah, that's possible.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:52.360]   The teaching I'm doing at the college is related to my current main career field.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.880]   In doing those courses, it would be natural to keep up with things, I suppose.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.400]   >>Dave: You said you have one seven-month-old child and you're hoping to have more children
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   in the future?
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.080]   >>Kate: Yeah, that's a whole different conversation.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.920]   The reason we have so much money set aside is we adopted our first and we're undergoing
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   fertility treatment.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.560]   That's a lovely money suck if you've ever looked into that.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.800]   >>Dave: Indeed it is.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:25.200]   Well, the points of analysis that I've given to you, I think if you think through them,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.640]   talk them through with your husband, you'll probably gain a little bit of clarity.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.320]   But here is what I have observed in life.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.880]   I need to record a stand-alone episode on this fairly soon.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:45.320]   But I've come to believe that money is almost never the constraining factor and that time
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.760]   almost always is the constraining factor.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.960]   Money is relatively easy to create.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.160]   It's relatively easy to earn.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.800]   It's relatively easy to create.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:00.620]   You've already established yourself as being able to generate $130,000 per year.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.500]   Because of that, you will never see yourself as the kind of person who's only capable of
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.680]   generating $30,000 per year.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.960]   You'll always see yourself as the kind of person who's capable of generating at least
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.160]   $130,000 per year.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.520]   So I'm confident that if you needed to go and get a job, I'm confident that you could
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.240]   go and get another one and make $100,000 a year just because that's become a part of
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.000]   your personal identity.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.160]   You're not intimidated by that.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.680]   It's just part of your identity.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:34.160]   I also think that if you could keep current that you will have options open to you.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.220]   Some careers don't lead themselves well to being able to be maintained as a backup plan
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.560]   and some do.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.800]   But what I would do is in the transition I would say, "How can I keep current in my industry
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.880]   so that if I needed to come back and get this job I could?"
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.000]   So I would focus on a few things related to that.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.100]   Number one, keeping my knowledge and skills current.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:04.060]   If that's what you're teaching in then you have an obvious way to do that.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.560]   But that would be the first thing is keeping your knowledge and your skills current.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.980]   Number two would be relationships.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.380]   How can you keep your relationships current?
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.840]   Now relationships can be managed with just a little bit of time.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.020]   But I would make sure that I kept friendships with my boss.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.820]   I would make sure that I kept friendships with my coworkers.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:28.060]   And then I would create a very careful strategic plan with how to maintain professional relationships.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.700]   I would make sure that I maintained relationships with all the other people that I know in my
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   industry.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.020]   It could be as simple as a quarterly lunch with your competitor across town.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.740]   It could be making sure that you prioritize going to the industry conference or the classes
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.500]   or whatever is appropriate to your industry.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.660]   Wherever the who's who gathers where you build those social connections.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.420]   Make sure that that's part of your plan to be there.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.340]   And especially if you're teaching I think that's a natural way for you to keep that
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.340]   current.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.840]   And then number three is your reputation.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.800]   One of the most important things is that you keep your reputation alive.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.260]   What suffers is when people leave a career and they stop promoting their skills and their
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.740]   abilities in that career then they start to atrophy and all the reputation starts to die
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.340]   and then they're back trying to apply for jobs like a fresh college grad which is not
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.780]   where you should be.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.300]   And so you have to think through what could you do to keep your reputation current.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.840]   And so I would look at publishing and publishing is a number of different things.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.380]   Publishing could be things as simple as staying current on relevant professional networks,
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.300]   LinkedIn, Facebook, wherever people in that career are.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.620]   I would look at if you're a teacher and you're researching and involved in this at the cutting
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:48.060]   edge I would stay current on publishing in relevant professional journals.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.180]   That would be a natural fit for you and it wouldn't take you that much time.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.340]   Let's say you write an article every six months for a relevant professional journal.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.140]   That keeps your name current in your field even if you don't have the day job and it
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.280]   gives you a specific area and that gives you the ability to demonstrate to your employer
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.140]   or to a different employer, "Look, I'm current in this."
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.980]   They don't have to know that that article only took you ten hours and you invested twenty
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.340]   hours into keeping current but you can keep a backup plan and you need to keep your reputation
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.380]   fresh and alive.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:22.020]   I would consider carefully my web presence, my blog, my professional website.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.940]   It doesn't take that much work to keep a professional website up to date in your field.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.640]   A post every few weeks, a couple of articles, things like that.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:39.220]   Just keeping your professional resume current would help you to be confident that you have
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.380]   options.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.660]   Now that's all designed to give you a backup plan and I think that once you have a backup
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:50.600]   plan you can feel more confident going forward with what you perceive to be a risky endeavor.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.780]   For me that's always been important.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:57.060]   My backup plan is if I go broke I can always go back to financial planning and I can always
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.820]   go get a job because I have the qualifications and I'm staying current enough and I have
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   a public reputation.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.100]   If I made an announcement on Radical Personal Finance that I'm looking for a job in financial
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.780]   planning I'd get plenty of emails in a day of people offering me positions.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.100]   A lot of them would be really interesting and I could have a job very quickly.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.940]   So basically that's what you want to create for yourself as a backup plan.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.460]   I could take the exams, I could be requalified in a month and I'd be ready to go.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:29.620]   Now given that you have a backup plan my answer is if you need more time you don't need more
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.620]   money.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.500]   We've established that with your husband's income and with your savings you could live
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.380]   on that until you could generate more income.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.020]   So you don't actually need more money.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.500]   The money is fine.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.620]   What you need to make those businesses grow is more time.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.540]   And so if this is the thing that's going to help you to get more time I say go for it.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:54.180]   And what I would say is what most concerns me is the phase of life that you're in with
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.020]   a seven month old and potentially having more children.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.780]   The earlier you make this transition the better because it's a lot easier to make a transition
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.580]   with a seven month old than it is with a four year old.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.340]   And so the earlier you make the transition the better.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.680]   And so long story short I would say go for it.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   Go for it quickly.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.580]   Keep a backup plan.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:22.600]   Make design a plan for income and then make sure that you have a method of accountability
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   to yourself or to your peers or to somebody so that you don't just take the time and goof
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.380]   off with it but you take the additional time and you really make the business profitable.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.980]   But I would move quickly in the direction of the new businesses.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.320]   Awesome.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.220]   That was a wonderful, wonderful answer to my question and gave me a lot to work with.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.220]   I really appreciate it.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.220]   Good.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.220]   Thanks for calling in Jordan.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.220]   I'm so glad you were here.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.220]   We've got Chase in Missouri.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.220]   Chase welcome.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.220]   How can I serve you today?
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.220]   Hey Joshua.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.660]   I have two separate questions for you if that's all right.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.660]   Let's go.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:56.040]   So for the last six-ish months my wife and I have been planning on her becoming a travel
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.620]   nurse and me a stay at home dad with our two young kids starting this July.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.180]   My current work contract goes through June.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:09.780]   I was planning on telling my boss this month that I would not be coming back.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.780]   We were planning on doing the travel nurse for between one to three years.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:19.380]   Our oldest child starts kindergarten not this coming school year but the following and we're
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.060]   okay doing homeschool for a couple years but not forever.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:32.380]   With everything that's going on do we need to put a complete hold on that thought?
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.780]   When were you planning to submit your notice?
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.740]   This month?
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.740]   That could wait.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.460]   If you waited something like three months how would that hurt your family?
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.460]   It would not.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:56.980]   If I could continue and I meant to say this to Jordan and she dropped off the line.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:04.700]   I would if I were in that situation right now I would just wait a little bit to get
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.740]   more clarity on what's going to happen.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:12.220]   We're right in a period with regard to all of the coronavirus stuff and everything right
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.580]   now for clear context.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:22.740]   We're in a period where I think the evidence that we do have that is pretty solid indicates
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:29.580]   that we're going to have a massive impact from this global pandemic.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.980]   I'm convinced it is genuinely, it has been for a while, but it's genuinely a global pandemic.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:42.580]   I'm convinced there are tens and tens of thousands of cases already in the United States and
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:48.180]   they're just simply not tested and so that's going to have a big impact.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.060]   Many countries in the world are past the point of containment.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.780]   The British Prime Minister for example or the British Health Minister was just today
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.500]   talking about the fact that we're moving past stage one which is we're moving past any effort
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.140]   to contain the pandemic and now we're moving to mitigate it just to slow it so we can provide
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.020]   more of the necessary health support.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:17.060]   I think that right now the next few weeks are going to be really, really key.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.940]   What's going to happen is everyone's still wrestling with what does this mean.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.300]   It's why the stock market is just massive swings.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.780]   It's unclear because the data is unclear, but what's going to happen is in the next
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.940]   few weeks the data is going to become more and more clear.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:35.940]   I think at the moment, and I've said this publicly, at the moment I don't see how if
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.780]   there's an argument to say that this is going to be anything less than economically devastating,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.220]   I cannot find it.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.540]   I cannot make the argument.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.860]   If you tell me Joshua, make the best case, the very best case scenario that I can see
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:55.420]   and feel at all intellectually honest about is simply it's going to be devastating economically.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.460]   Although it's going to take time because just like we have a lag with the number of people
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.180]   presenting with virus symptoms and economic lag, it's going to take time for that economic
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.820]   data to start to filter out.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:14.540]   I think it's going to cause a significant recession in the United States, possibly worse.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.300]   We don't know right at the moment what that is going to look like.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.500]   What I would see for you is number one, a little bit of extra money is helpful right
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.500]   now.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.900]   If it's not too big of a risk on your lifestyle, a little bit of extra money never makes anybody
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.260]   feel worse.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:37.540]   Number two is if we get a few weeks further or a few months further and it looks like
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:44.220]   the fears of this being a long deep cut, maybe there's a miraculous treatment that's developed
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.980]   or maybe there's a miraculous vaccine development.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.300]   Well, you're not hurt by that and so that would be great, right?
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:54.660]   If some kind of miraculous treatment were developed, that'd be wonderful.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.760]   In which case it minimizes it, looks like the economy is going to then everything can
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.940]   be restarted, great.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:07.980]   If it's bad, then what I would say is being more well employed is going to be fine.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.820]   Now in your situation with your wife in nursing, obviously that's going to be in very high
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.100]   demand including travel nursing.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.240]   So I'm not concerned there.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.800]   My final point would be is just simply if you can figure out a way to get laid off instead
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.460]   of submitting a resignation, that would be more helpful for you.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.460]   And so at the moment it seems premature right now to do that.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:34.460]   But if I were you, I would follow the advice in Financial Samurai's book on how to get
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.900]   laid off and just simply try to see that if layoffs come to your company, to your business,
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.060]   that you're at the top of that list because that may allow you to make this transition
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.460]   that you're already making a little bit more effective.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.360]   It may qualify you for severance pay, may qualify you for extra benefits, may qualify
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.440]   you for unemployment.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:59.220]   Those kinds of benefits might be helpful to you as you make that transition.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:04.620]   So I would, if I were what you described, I would wait and I think that a month from
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.140]   now is going to be very instructive.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.420]   A few more months is going to be very instructive.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:13.140]   At any point in time, you can go ahead and submit the notice of resignation, but I would
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.500]   wait with the hope of getting laid off.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.500]   Okay.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.740]   Makes a lot of sense.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.620]   My next question is about tax loss harvesting.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:29.260]   So if I have two index funds of equal amounts, one tracking the Dow Jones and one the P500,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:34.180]   can I sell both of those for the tax loss and then rebuy the other one basically kind
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:42.220]   of switching those with that money or is that too muddied?
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.220]   I don't know.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.220]   I would have to read.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.940]   I had to go back and do some research on that.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   I don't know.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:56.100]   I would have to research that and so I can't give you a good answer.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.540]   I would say that in general, the first thing I would do is I would research it.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.140]   I would try to connect.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.460]   I would look at it and I need to go back and look at those rules and really understand
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.460]   it.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.140]   And I don't have that document.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:11.140]   I don't have the IRS regulations in front of me.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.780]   But I'll tell you how it approaches.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:21.820]   First I would read it and then if I felt that I had a clear kind of intent of the law case,
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:26.380]   meaning that I'm morally clear, that I believe that I'm following what the law says, I would
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:32.620]   just do it and take the loss because that's the kind of transaction that the first thing
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.240]   is you need to imagine yourself standing in front of a tax court judge and defending that
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.340]   decision or sitting in front of an auditor and defending the decision.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.820]   And if based upon your reading of the rules you feel like that is a qualified event, then
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.420]   I have no problem doing it.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:52.100]   And chances are realistically, the chances of you getting audited or the chances of it
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.740]   being questioned are infinitesimally low.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.620]   And there's no real significant penalty for that kind of thing.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.460]   So you've got – you're just playing the odds.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:07.140]   It's like number one, I'm satisfied in my conscience that I'm obeying the law and I'm
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.260]   doing what is right and I could make this argument in public.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.820]   That's the first standard.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:19.660]   Now within that standard, there are no – the only repercussion is if you did get audited
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:27.260]   and then if you did lose the argument and then if you did have the transaction disallowed,
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:32.740]   then you would pay a penalty or this is the cost of the tax that you would have incurred
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:36.240]   otherwise or you would lose the benefit and the transaction would be undone.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.660]   And that's just not a meaningful benefit.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.340]   It's not a meaningful – it's not going to hurt you.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.620]   And so I would do it.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:48.100]   If I felt that upon my reading of the laws of the regulation as written on the IRS website
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.740]   said that this is good enough, that this is different enough, then I would do it.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.940]   But I haven't read those regulations in enough time that I can answer on the spot for you.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   >>Josh: Okay.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:58.940]   Sounds good.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.940]   Thank you.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.940]   >>Steve: My pleasure.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.940]   All right.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:02.940]   Move on to the great state of New York.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.940]   Peter, welcome to the show.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.940]   How can I serve you today?
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.380]   >>Peter: Hi, Josh.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.980]   Two quick ones.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:13.580]   Number one, my wife is a French and U.S. citizen.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:17.260]   We don't have any children but are thinking about it.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.140]   How hard would it be for me to become a citizen of the EU and is it worth it?
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:26.380]   And second question is how do you know it's time to buy a stock you've had on your shopping
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.500]   list for a long time these days?
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.220]   >>Steve: Good questions.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.980]   So is the question for your citizenship or for your children?
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.780]   >>Peter: Since we don't have any kids yet.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.340]   How about we go with me?
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.340]   >>Steve: Okay.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:45.740]   So of what benefit would an EU citizenship be for you right now?
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:48.540]   >>Peter: I don't think any.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.860]   >>Steve: Then it's probably not worth it.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:58.700]   So you should, I would need to check the laws, but generally speaking if you're married to
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:05.220]   your wife who's an EU citizen, then you should be able to negotiate a residency permit for
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.220]   you.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:10.780]   You may not be able to immediately become a U.S. citizen but you should qualify for
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.980]   a residency permit similar to the way that your wife should qualify for a residency permit
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:20.480]   in the United States if she weren't already a resident and/or a citizen.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:26.420]   So that right of abode should be sufficient for you because if you became an EU resident
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:34.340]   then you would have the ability to live there, to partake in whatever the EU systems are
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.820]   that are of benefit for you and that would be good enough.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:43.840]   And so my step one is I would research those requirements and see if there's a way of starting
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:51.260]   that residency process, see what it would take to maintain that residency permit, and
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.700]   I just don't know the answers to those things off the top of my head.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:59.620]   This is where it's every country matters and you have to see what the time requirements
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   are.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:05.100]   In some countries it's relatively easy to maintain a residence permit with minimal time
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.100]   on the ground.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.460]   With other countries it's not.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.900]   You have to be there for a substantial amount of time.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:16.820]   Next you have to count the cost and so one of the costs of an EU residence permit or
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.580]   a citizenship if you're actually on the ground, and that's how you would earn it.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:26.920]   So let's say that you negotiate it, you think about it, and you decide, "You know what?
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.500]   We actually do want to go to France and we want to live there."
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.660]   That's generally what's going to be required for you to become a French citizen based upon
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.180]   being married to a French citizen.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.100]   So the marriage qualifies you for a residence permit but you have to go and put a time in
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.420]   on the ground.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:47.220]   That could be very expensive for you with regard to a lifestyle cost, leaving friends,
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.380]   family, things that are familiar, going abroad.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.060]   It could be very expensive to you from a tax cost.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.980]   France is not known for low taxes.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.460]   It could just be very expensive.
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.740]   On the flip side, that could be something that you'd be thrilled to do.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.940]   Instead of viewing it as a cost, you might be thrilled to go and live in France and you'd
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.220]   love the adventure of it and the chance to do it.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.380]   And so you count the costs for that.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:14.580]   If you don't have a pressing need for it though, and you can't imagine how your life would
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:20.920]   be very different because of it, then I wouldn't push it very hard because that's an option
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.700]   that should be available to you in the future as long as you stay married.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.820]   You should, as long as you're married, be able to qualify for that residence permit
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.780]   in the future.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:34.140]   And so unless you have some reason why it's a pressing need, why it's very important to
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:41.060]   you, and if the costs are high, then there's no reason to pay those costs right now.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.860]   For your children, however, things could be different.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:48.100]   And so what you need to do is if you did have children in the future, you need to make sure
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:53.700]   you understand very clearly what the citizenship rights are that they would be qualified for
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:58.180]   based upon your wife's French citizenship.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:07.420]   I can't say those laws off the top of my head, but probably anywhere they're born, they would
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.060]   qualify for French citizenship because their mother is French.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:15.780]   And probably anywhere they're born, they would qualify for US citizenship because you're
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   a US citizen.
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.780]   Is your wife also a US citizen?
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.780]   Yes.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.780]   Okay.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.500]   So they would certainly be qualified for US citizenship.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.620]   But in some countries, that may not be the case.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:32.100]   And so the reason I'm saying this is probably not for France, but in some countries, give
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.980]   me an example, Canada.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:43.140]   Let's say that if your wife were a Canadian citizen, but yet she was not born in Canada,
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:49.660]   she was born in the United States, but she became a Canadian citizenship by naturalization.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:56.300]   If she then later had a child in the United States, that child, it's my understanding,
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:01.820]   that child would not be qualified for Canadian citizenship because the child's mother was
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.580]   not born in Canada.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.880]   Now, if she had been a natural born citizen of Canada, then the child would be qualified
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.500]   for Canadian citizenship, even if the child were born outside of the United States, sorry,
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.880]   outside of Canada.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:21.220]   But if the child's mother had naturalized as a Canadian citizen, but didn't give birth
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.700]   in Canada, the child would not be entitled to that citizenship.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.820]   And so what you want to think through is you want to research the laws of France and see
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.340]   if there are similar laws.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:33.460]   Now, since both you and she are US citizens and you've been living in the United States
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:37.700]   for a substantial time, no matter where your child is born, your child would be qualified
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.300]   for US citizenship.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:43.500]   But if she found out that for some reason the child would not be qualified for French
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.140]   citizenship unless the child were born in France, then you would want to go and have
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.860]   the child in France.
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:52.940]   Chances are the child would be qualified for French citizenship no matter where the child
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.500]   is born, which means that if you did have a baby, and we're going way down the ifs range,
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.060]   but if you did have a baby and if you did feel like you were capable as a couple of
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:07.340]   doing birth tourism, you would be wiser to go to a third country and have the child in
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.800]   a third country instead.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.900]   Could be as simple as Canada or Mexico or any number of other countries that also have
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.220]   benefits.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.380]   And what I would do is I would research the places where the child could have interesting
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.060]   options based upon the French heritage.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:24.060]   So I would look at the former French territories and colonies and things like that.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.740]   And perhaps there would be an option where the child could get a really interesting third
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:33.620]   citizenship based upon being born in a country that was a former French colony.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.260]   And so that would be a way that from birth your child would have three citizenships.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:45.260]   But for you, back to your question, if the cost is high and the benefit is low, don't
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.260]   do it.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.540]   If the cost is low, you'd really enjoy living in France, you're living on investments, not
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.060]   on earned income, thus you wouldn't generate high taxes, well then go live in France for
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.540]   a few years and go ahead and get your French citizenship.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.240]   But that's my answer.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.240]   Questions on that so far?
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.020]   >>Steve: Nope, makes sense.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:09.820]   >>Steve: With regard to buying a stock, what is your method, personally, of assessing the
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   value of a stock?
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:19.020]   >>Steve: So personally I tend to refer to a third party and the one that I trust the
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.580]   most is Morningstar.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:25.580]   >>Steve: Okay, so you're then not talking about a stock, you're talking about a mutual
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580]   fund.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.580]   Are you talking about a mutual fund or a stock?
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   >>Steve: A stock.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:40.180]   I'll use their rating system or one of the other analysts to give me X many stars or
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.780]   it's a buy or a hold or whatever.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:47.060]   I'm not doing my own intense analysis of the balance sheet or anything like that.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.180]   >>Steve: Well, in that situation, if that's your method of analysis, then you buy when
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:57.580]   you have the money and when the Morningstar analysts recommend it as a buy.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.580]   >>Steve: Seems pretty simple.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   >>Steve: Yeah, and I think that the answer, it is simple and I don't need to expound on
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:13.820]   it but the first question is always what do I believe makes this a good investment?
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.300]   On what basis am I going to judge this?
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:24.020]   And so then you follow that chain of logic through and if you trust the Morningstar analysts
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.020]   that they know what is going on and you believe that they are competent in doing that and
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:32.900]   then they make a buy recommendation for the stock, well then the answer is simple.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:37.340]   You wait for them to make the buy recommendation, you wait for yourself, for you to have the
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.460]   money available and then you go ahead and make the purchase.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.180]   All right, we go on now to looks like the state of Virginia.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180]   Welcome to the show.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180]   How can I serve you today?
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:50.700]   Got a caller from the state of Virginia.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:56.900]   Go ahead please.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.500]   Going once, 571 area code, your name is not on my screen.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   Go ahead please.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.260]   All right, we will come back to you in a moment.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.980]   Looks like now to New York City.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980]   New York, welcome to the call.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980]   How can I serve you today?
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980]   >>Jaycee: Ashfaq, hey, thank you.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.980]   This is Jaycee.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   So first, thank you for the opportunity.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   Hoping you and your family progress through this turbulent times healthy and unscathed.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.540]   My question probably lost its time in terms of opportunity time, but I figured I would
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.540]   ask you anyway.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:35.220]   Two weeks ago, I was pondering pulling out $50,000 out of my 401(k) via a loan to put
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.580]   aside for potential opportunities.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.700]   So two weeks ago, I'm thinking, okay, something's going to happen.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.860]   It's not really reacting towards what's going on globally.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.580]   So unfortunately, something that soon was going to happen, happened.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.740]   But I didn't do it.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:53.780]   But I was wondering if I could get your opinion on that type of method of taking out money
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.580]   via a 401(k) loan for interest of the opportunities.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:04.060]   That 50K would represent about 10% of my portfolio at that time, a lot more now.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:11.900]   But my interests were either to have it liquid for any emergency use, or potentially multifamily
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   investment.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.500]   I already own two families.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:21.140]   So I was thinking, depending long term or short term period, there'll be some opportunities.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.700]   And the third one was actually to invest in a family dental practice, a new dental practice
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.340]   in Latin America.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.140]   So those are the three opportunities that I was seeing for that need.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.780]   I already have 20K in hand.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.100]   So I have some emergency money.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.300]   It was more about kind of taking it out before what ended up happening in the crash currently
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   occurring.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:49.340]   So I guess the real question for you is, is that type of methodology solid in the future?
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:56.260]   Since I think it's already too late for me to do so without losing Sabir with the fact
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.780]   that the market already crashed 20%.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.700]   And if that's something that if there's something I'm missing in terms of taking out money to
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.340]   a 401k loan.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.900]   I'm open to it.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.580]   I'm not hardcore opposed to the idea.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.660]   I used to be.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:16.740]   I used to kind of follow the standard financial advisor advice to say, don't touch the money
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.940]   in your 401k, just like I used to follow the standard financial advisor.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.460]   Don't take the money out of your 401k.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:28.100]   And I think financial advisors who maintain those positions generally have good reasons
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.500]   for doing it.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.460]   The experience that most of us financial advisors have is the vast majority of people that we
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:42.220]   observe who cash out a 401k or who take out a 401k loan, spend the money on consumption
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:44.180]   rather than on investment.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:49.820]   And so when you see this again and again and again and again, it causes you to be fairly
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:55.580]   jaded and to basically assume that everybody is going to spend the money on consumption
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.260]   rather than investment.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:05.540]   And so you learn that you've got to play the averages and so you generate these go-to opinions
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.220]   such as never cash money out of a 401k.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.820]   Because you know if somebody leaves their job and they cash money out of their 401k
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:18.580]   and they take it, they take the distribution, you know it's going to be spent on frivolous
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.580]   consumption.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.540]   That's just what 90% of the people that you watch do it.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:25.220]   And so you generate these opinions.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:30.020]   Or this is what happens when people do a home equity loan of credit or they refinance their
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.260]   credit cards into their house.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.740]   When you watch again and again and again that somebody has credit card debt and then they
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.380]   take out, they refinance their house and they pay off their credit card debt using their
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:45.180]   HELOC, well you know that almost every single time they're going to go ahead and increase
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.700]   the credit card debt again and then now they don't have the money in their house because
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.020]   they used it on consumption.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.900]   Thus they're not getting wealthier.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:03.740]   So I used to follow that with regard to 401k loans and with just taking distributions from
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.580]   retirement accounts.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:12.380]   I've since modified my opinion on that largely because I'm in a different space now.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:17.180]   You know the average listener of radical personal finance is not a consumption driven person
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.400]   but rather an accumulation driven person.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.500]   The average listener of radical personal finance is not an entry-level worker but rather a
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:29.180]   very high earning, highly educated person.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:34.280]   So now these days I just take it much more tactically and say is this the best source
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:40.260]   of funds at this particular time because the mathematical answer to the question comes
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.100]   down to what's the alternative use of the dollar.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.980]   Let's say that you were going to go to your 401k, you're going to sell stocks at a 20%
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.500]   discount or 30% discount, whatever the portfolio is down over the last couple of weeks and
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:59.460]   in order to take a 401k loan out you take $50,000 but you're able to take that $50,000
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:07.940]   loan and invest it into a dental practice in Latin America but that dental practice
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:13.100]   grows in the next five years where your equity stake in that dental practice grows to be
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.820]   worth $400,000.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.620]   Well obviously under that scenario, obviously that was a better move than leaving the money
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.460]   sitting in mainstream US equities.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:30.740]   And so if you are really confident in that kind of hardcore rate of return, really just
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:37.260]   this is a potential I'm convinced, maybe you're going to do medical tourism and you're going
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.460]   to do a medical tourism for dental practice in Costa Rica or Mexico or something like
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:46.620]   that and you're convinced that your family member if they just had $50,000 they'd be
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:52.020]   able to go from one dental office to a string of dental offices with thousands and thousands
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.940]   of Americans and Canadians coming down to get their dental work done in Costa Rica or
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940]   Mexico.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:02.220]   Well in that situation you should do it.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:08.020]   But if you don't have a compelling use of the dollar then it all of a sudden doesn't
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.820]   seem so good.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.740]   So my answer to you is what's the better investment?
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:21.180]   Because you should always go with the best investment that's at your fingertips and the
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:30.340]   factor of whether you take money out of the 401k or whether you take money out of a 401k
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:33.840]   or whatever it just comes down to that those are just technical details.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.780]   You have to be convinced of what the better investment is.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:42.860]   So to give you a direct answer first are you convinced of what the clear investment is
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.580]   or is it just an opportunity fund?
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:48.020]   Let's call it an opportunity fund.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.540]   There is an opportunity for the dentist.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:56.260]   There's a young cousin who's actually here, putting tables to make money to be able to
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.220]   start that practice and he's going to be going back soon.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.620]   He's staying with me so we're very close.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:07.340]   And I haven't gauged that opportunity to him but I see that as a potential market and I
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.820]   could definitely support him and trust him for that.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.020]   And the other thing, the other investment was multi-family which is something I'm already
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:20.300]   learning and expecting to heavily get involved with in the next few years.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:25.020]   So those are the two elements that I could navigate comfortably.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:30.980]   Again, it was something I really wanted to pull out two weeks ago.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.500]   Now I'm more hesitant on it.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.860]   So I am more hesitant today than I was two weeks ago.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.620]   Unfortunately, I just didn't take that.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.620]   I didn't do it two weeks ago.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   So...
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.620]   You learned a lesson on that one.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:46.740]   I was, you know, I figured I'd still ask because in the future it might happen again.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.740]   Of course, of course.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.740]   Why not learn from it?
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.540]   Well, the lesson should be that if you are thinking about doing something like that,
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.360]   you need to honestly assess how serious you are about it.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.940]   And then if investments are up and markets are good, just do it.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.220]   Don't wait on it.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.600]   Because if you have an alternative use of the dollar, don't wait.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.720]   Do it that you think is better because it feels a lot, it doesn't feel so bad to sit
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.820]   back and miss out on a little bit of upside.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:16.700]   It feels a lot worse to want to do something else but then to have to look at your portfolio
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.100]   and say, "Am I really going to sell these investments at a discount?"
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.120]   So here's my answer to you.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.820]   From what, from a few minutes of what you're saying, I don't think, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:32.740]   sell and take a loan on something that is just a maybe, maybe an opportunity fund.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:38.240]   I would, because I think that again, the opportunities are probably going to be very affected.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.800]   And that's one of the things about where we are right now.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:46.060]   The reason the market is down in your US-based investments is the same reason why the market
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.480]   is down in your Mexican investments or is down in your Asian investments.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:59.340]   The entire world is being affected right now, which is the huge risk of a viral infectious
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.080]   outbreak is, that's what I've talked about extensively on the show.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:09.140]   It's such a huge risk because of its global nature, which means that not only do you have
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.100]   risks in the United States, but you have risks everywhere.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:18.540]   So if the United States goes into recession, that in and of itself makes it a very difficult
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:22.940]   time to do things like start new businesses in Latin America.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.220]   You know, there's the saying about when the United States sneezes, Latin America catches
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.220]   a cold.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:32.460]   It's just the United States is such a huge powerhouse economy influencing the whole region
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:38.740]   that often the effects of what happens in the superpower expand to the region around.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.300]   So here's my answer.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.160]   I wouldn't sell money in my 401k.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.300]   If I were going to do this deal, what I would do is I would just cut my expenses now, which
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.660]   I think everybody should be doing, is cutting expenses now to the significant discretionary
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.300]   expenses need to go away.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.800]   I would be saving as much money as possible, making as much money as possible.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.500]   And then if you haven't already done it, I would establish a credit card portfolio and
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.460]   set up the credit card portfolio with the intention of using some of that money for
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.420]   opportunities.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:18.220]   Because in the situation like you're describing, you may come to a point, before I would cash
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.660]   money out of the 401k and take a 401k loan, I would just simply move the investments from
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:30.340]   mutual funds to cash, keep them inside the 401k, and I would finance the need with 0%
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.920]   interest rate credit cards.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.540]   Then if necessary, if the investment fell apart or if I lost my job or something like
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.740]   that, then that's the point that I would go ahead and make the distribution from the 401k.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.940]   But I think that's a safer move than just taking the money out.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.700]   And it gives you more options to make up the difference with increased earnings, increased
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.100]   savings from your expenses.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.660]   Now that's risky.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.100]   You've got to be very good at your behavior, but that's what I would do from a financial
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.100]   engineering perspective.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.100]   Well, thank you.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.700]   I definitely will plug your credit card course.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:06.500]   I have taken it and I do have a credit card portfolio in hand as needed.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.740]   Very low usage right now, but it's there just in case.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.580]   I also would plug the other two courses and I've gone through them.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.580]   I'm going to the survival one right now.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.540]   Preparing is in that as well.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.100]   So really thank you for everything you've done.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.100]   I really appreciate it.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.100]   Good.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.100]   I appreciate that plug.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.940]   And of course, if any of the rest of you are motivated to go and take those courses, you
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.060]   can find those at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.060]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.140]   At the very least, anybody who has a credit card should go and take that course.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.620]   All right, we go now to Atlanta.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.620]   Welcome to the show.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.620]   How can I serve you today?
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.620]   Hi, Josh.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.620]   Can you hear me?
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.620]   Yes, go ahead.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.100]   So let's make things interesting, shall we?
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.300]   I am in pursuit of freedom.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:51.300]   Right now, financial freedom in terms of lowering taxes, which is everyone's biggest expense.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.980]   I'm also seeking freedom from obligations that states place on me.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:00.620]   And I run a single member LLC and I can live anywhere, though right now I'm stuck in the
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.860]   US for more than just the coronavirus.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:10.340]   So with that in mind, I'm pursuing what the privacy guru, Michael Bazell, calls nomadship.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:14.700]   So this involves taking up legal residence in South Dakota, getting a postal box that
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.980]   has a legal address, getting a driver's license, car registration.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.660]   The reason South Dakota is good is because they're used to RV people coming and going
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.220]   and they don't make many claims on their residence.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.140]   So in the end, you end up with a legitimate address and identification without having
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.480]   to set foot in South Dakota except to set this all up.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.100]   From that point on, you can live wherever you want.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.340]   And so South Dakota also has the benefit of being a no income tax state.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:46.380]   And so my question is, if someone were to become a nomad in this way and just live all
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.620]   around, how would they make sure that the other states they live in during the year
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.500]   don't make any claims on them, tax or otherwise?
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:01.700]   Each state, and to be clear, do you need to be or desire to be in the United States or
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:05.260]   are you also willing to consider an international approach to this?
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:11.660]   Oh, I'm willing to consider it, but I suspect I will probably be in the US for the near
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.660]   future.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:13.660]   All right.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.020]   So let's start with the US based way to do it.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:20.100]   The way that you establish, every state is different.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:24.460]   And so if you're going to be, your business is digital, I get the impression your business
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.900]   is digital?
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.900]   Yes.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.900]   Okay.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.380]   Every state has different laws.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:36.020]   And in the United States, this is a subject that's not nearly as talked about as it is
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020]   internationally.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.820]   Now, I've studied the laws of a bunch of states, I've worked with some clients on this and
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.740]   we've kind of worked it out.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:48.260]   But there's a legal answer and there's a practical answer and you're going to have to navigate
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.580]   through it.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:55.340]   The legal answer is each state has a different formula that they're going to use based upon
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:00.300]   to establish your being a tax resident of that state.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.700]   And this is where it depends on what state you're going to spend most of your time in.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:14.860]   If you establish your legal residency in South Dakota and then you spend a year in Texas
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:21.700]   living in an RV at a Texas RV park, the state of Texas is generally not really going to
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.220]   care whether you're actually physically in their state because the state of Texas doesn't
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.540]   impose state income taxes.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.260]   That's a very different scenario than if you establish your legal residency in South Dakota
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:40.100]   and then you move to the state of New York and you rent a condo in the state of New York
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.980]   and you're physically inside New York for 365 days running your digital business.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:49.060]   Now the state of New York is going to care because the state of New York wants their
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.500]   income taxes.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:56.660]   So the reason that these states such as South Dakota, Florida, and Texas allow nomad residency
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:05.380]   status is that they're not extracting income tax revenue from you, from anybody, and so
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.620]   they don't mind if you're in their state and you register things.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.420]   To the state of South Dakota, with you being an RVer, that's a benefit to the state because
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:20.340]   now they're generating tax revenue on the licensing of your vehicle, of your RV, of
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.380]   anything else, any other business that you do with the state.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:28.060]   The local insurance agents are generating some revenue based upon selling you South
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:32.980]   Dakota qualified insurance and no other South Dakota residents are paying income tax anyway
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.460]   and so South Dakota is happy to have you.
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:40.840]   So if you spend your time in South Dakota, in Wyoming, in Texas, and in Florida, basically
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.020]   you could probably spend as much time as you wanted in those states and not have any problem.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:51.620]   One thing you want to think about is not only tax but also the concept of domicile.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:57.620]   If you have significant assets, domicile can be important with regard to your estate, how
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.860]   your estate is settled.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:03.860]   If you are a resident of South Dakota but you have a house in Florida and then you die,
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.140]   how is your estate settled?
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.980]   Let's skip that because it's a little bit complex and let's just focus on income tax.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:14.620]   Now beyond that, you research the laws of the state that you want to check out.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.580]   So let's say that you did like the state of New York.
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:20.100]   Well you look up the state of New York income tax residency and you see what the state of
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:26.900]   New York has and most states have a combination of factors that they discuss.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:32.300]   One factor is the amount of time that you physically spend in the state.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:37.140]   If you're in a state 11 months per year in the state of New York and you're in the state
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.300]   of South Dakota one month per year, it's a little hard to argue that South Dakota is
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.500]   actually your state.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.420]   So time is a factor.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:49.860]   In general, if you are going to be a nomad physically moving around, well it's, you know,
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:53.060]   if you spent four months here, four months there, four months in the other place or five
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.220]   months here, five months there, five months in the other place, you're going to be fine.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:01.060]   The second factor that is usually going to be considered would be basically the concept
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.220]   of nexus.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.180]   How connected are you to the state?
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:11.220]   Again New York, you have a house, you have a business, you have a New York LLC, you spend
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:17.460]   10 months a year in another state but your house, your vote in New York, all the stuff
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.460]   is in New York.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.300]   Well now New York is going to say, "No, look, you're really connected here."
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:27.020]   And so when I'm teaching somebody and consulting on how to move out of one of these aggressive
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:32.180]   states, the two most aggressive states being New York and California, one of the most important
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:37.460]   things is to move your nexus, your life to another place.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:42.020]   And generally if you're not really wealthy, not generating a huge amount of income, you're
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:47.340]   not, it's not a big deal but New York and California are extremely aggressive in chasing
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.180]   down people who claim former residency.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:53.220]   There was a court case a number of years ago about a guy who moved to Texas but he would
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.180]   commute back and forth to New York City and I think the distinguishing factor came down
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.780]   to where his dog was located.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.500]   And if my memory is right, he won the case with the state of New York because his dog
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.660]   was physically located in Texas.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.500]   And they came down and said, "Listen, yeah, I know he goes back and forth but he's a Texas
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   resident.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500]   That's where his dog is.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:16.700]   So if you got a dog, make sure your dog is in Texas and not in New York."
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.740]   So these are all kind of the legal questions and legal considerations.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.900]   If you make a lot of money or you have a lot of money, there's a much bigger target on
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:27.340]   your back than if you're just living on whatever income you generate from your business and
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.740]   you don't have a lot of money.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:36.180]   But you still want to go ahead and set up your status in a way that follows the law.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.180]   That's the legal consideration.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.060]   Now let's talk practicality.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:45.940]   Practically every state is different but practically because there aren't border controls at the
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:52.420]   states between various US states, there's a decent chance that you just kind of filter
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:58.620]   through without being found.
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:01.380]   Now this is harder than it once was.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:05.300]   And so an example would be the state of California.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:11.780]   In the state of California, all of the roads are monitored by automatic license plate reading
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.980]   systems.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:19.420]   And so let's say that you are a nomad resident of South Dakota but you drive your South Dakota
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:27.300]   plated car in California and the California license plate reading systems identify the
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.340]   fact that you're basically there all the time.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.340]   Well after a while, I don't know what that time is, I don't have any clear data on that,
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:38.260]   but after a while you're going to get a letter from the state of California saying you're
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:43.360]   a California resident, you need to plate your car and become a resident of California because
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.020]   your South Dakota plated car is in the state of California.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:51.860]   That's probably, that's very different than maybe the state of West Virginia.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:56.300]   The state of West Virginia is not nearly as committed to the license plate reading system
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:00.340]   as is California and they're not nearly as aggressive with tax collection as is the state
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.960]   of California.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:07.860]   So practically speaking, you could probably spend significant amounts of time in a state
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:11.100]   and generally slide under the radar.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.360]   This would be where some of Bazell's other techniques that he would teach would come
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.120]   into play as well.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.460]   It would be useful for you if you're going to spend significant amounts of time in a
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:24.220]   state, it'd be useful for you to have a car that's plated in that state to lower your
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.580]   profile and you could do that without necessarily establishing tax residence.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:34.420]   I'm not comfortable trying to go to the point of trying to say to somebody, "You're going
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.060]   to be, you're going to register in South Dakota, but you're going to live full time in North
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.060]   Carolina."
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.380]   I don't think that works.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:48.540]   Number one, it's not legal and I want to encourage people to follow the law and I think that
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:52.660]   in time, in the fullness of time, it's going to come back to hurt you.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:24:00.860]   If you were hardcore and by hardcore I mean if your last name was Bazell, then I think
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:07.060]   you could probably get away with it, but you're going to need to be hardcore and not using
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:13.580]   cash, not having a significant record of your vehicle located in those places, generally
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.660]   just maintaining an extremely low profile.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.660]   I think that that is possible.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:20.780]   Let me give you a scenario that would be practical.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:27.540]   If I were a California resident who was seeking to leave California and move to Nevada, the
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.620]   first thing I would do is I would follow the law and I would very clearly and firmly establish
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.220]   my Nevada residency.
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.980]   I would sell my house.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.260]   Selling house is different.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.020]   You could still own a house in California, but it's a whole body of evidence.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.140]   I would create this whole body of evidence that I had moved from California to Las Vegas
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:55.140]   and I would make sure that I moved my addresses, I moved my driver's license, I moved my doctors,
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:00.860]   I changed from being a part of the California local physician's board to being a part of
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.260]   the Nevada local physician's board.
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.620]   I registered to vote.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.060]   I joined a church in Nevada.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.340]   I would create this whole body of evidence for me to be in Nevada.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:13.540]   And then from then on, I would keep my footprint in California very, very light.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.180]   I wouldn't use a credit card in California.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.260]   I would use cash in California.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.620]   I would minimize flying into California.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.700]   I would consider driving into California instead of flying into California.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.140]   I would just basically practice all the good privacy techniques to make my presence in
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.380]   California very, very light.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:35.980]   On a situation like that, I think you could legally spend several months per year cumulatively
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:41.300]   in California and I think practically you could spend months a year in California without
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.900]   becoming a California tax resident.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.620]   But I wouldn't go all the way to saying, "Yeah, I've just made everything in Nevada, but I'm
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.660]   going to try to be in California the whole time."
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.660]   Is it theoretically possible?
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.100]   I bet you Bazelle could do it.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100]   You could probably do it.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:59.340]   But it's not legal and I think it burns you more than anything else and so I recommend
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:00.340]   against that.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:04.420]   I think the better strategy is just simply to choose the state of your residency and
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.820]   then establish a couple of places in the United States that you like to be and then in the
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.880]   same way that when I teach this internationally, just do that within the United States and
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:13.880]   that solves your problem.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:21.800]   And I said I'm pursuing freedom, so New York and California aren't even in my vocabulary
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   at this point in my life.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.140]   I agree with you and I'm happy to hear that.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:32.480]   Those states are important because they are aggressive and they are, especially as more
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:38.800]   and more people are leaving those states, the government in those states is paying very
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.360]   careful attention to people who are leaving those states and they are suing people for
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.680]   tax revenue and they're going after them.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.000]   And so I have a huge listenership in California and New York.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.020]   It's very important that if you're going to do it, you got to do it legitimately.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.860]   You can leave California.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.180]   You can leave New York.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.180]   You can.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.000]   They can't keep you forever.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.360]   Hotel California was a song.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.560]   It wasn't the real thing, but it can feel like it if you're just trying to do this on
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.080]   paper and you can't be sloppy about it.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.160]   You can't just say, oh, I'm going to go and move my driver's license to South Dakota and
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160]   that's good.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.400]   No, if you're going to leave New York, you've got to genuinely leave New York and you've
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.040]   got to amass the whole body of evidence that indicates that you have moved from New York.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.320]   And then later, I would say if you want to go back and visit family and things like that,
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.920]   fine, you can do that later, but you can't just do it on paper.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.360]   It's got to be done legitimately.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.800]   Sounds like a plan.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   Okay.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.960]   I would say to you, obviously, if you like being in the United States for lifestyle reasons,
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.640]   as millions of people do.
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   I don't.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.760]   I'm prepared to leave, actually.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:53.640]   I'm actually thinking about starting up my next company outside of the US.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.440]   I know that that doesn't solve tax obligations, but so that if I decided to leave in the future,
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.720]   it would be easier to do so.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.480]   So this is a lot simpler than you probably understand right now, though.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.040]   The United States is a bear when it comes to tax obligations.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.960]   And frustratingly, because of citizenship-based taxation, the frustrating thing about that
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:23.120]   is you can never get out fully of the US tax net unless you formally renounce your US citizenship,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.920]   which is a very significant step that the vast majority of those of us who are US citizens
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.080]   will just simply never do.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   But in some ways, you can make a very strong argument that it's a lot easier for US citizens
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.560]   who want to save taxes by moving abroad to do so on a modest amount of income than it
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.280]   is for other people.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.960]   So let's use Canada and the United States as an example.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.160]   If you were a Canadian who was interested in leaving Canada and becoming a tax resident
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.420]   somewhere else, you could do that.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:02.560]   And if you made a million dollars per year in Canada from your online business, you could
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.880]   move to the Cayman Islands and you could establish residency in the Cayman Islands where there's
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:14.360]   no income tax, and you can stop paying any tax obligations to the Canadian government.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.800]   That's the benefit of being a Canadian.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.200]   But in order for you to accomplish that, you have to basically sever all ties with the
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.000]   country of Canada.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   That would include...
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.520]   And now, you don't have to do all of these.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.680]   Again, it's a body of evidence.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.640]   You're basically creating a case that you could present if you ever had to.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.720]   But the safest way to do that is to basically terminate all of your connections with the
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.220]   country of Canada.
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:40.480]   You sell any real estate that you own.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.640]   You close investment accounts or move them elsewhere.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.240]   You cancel any credit cards that you have issued in the country of Canada.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.520]   You move bank accounts out of the country of Canada.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:57.760]   You basically disconnect all of your association and your ties with the nation of Canada, except
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.840]   for the fact of your Canadian citizenship and passport.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.820]   Now, the great thing about that as a Canadian is you can move to the Cayman Islands.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:08.480]   You can earn a million dollars a year and pay zero dollars of income taxes.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.120]   It's 100% legal.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.860]   It'll save you hundreds of thousands of dollars to do that.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.720]   And at any point in time, you can maintain your Canadian citizenship, which means you
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.520]   could still go back to Canada in the future and live there at any point in time and reset
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.080]   up that whole system.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.000]   And that's a major superior scenario over the United States.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   It's also a much more moral system of income tax collection than the United States system,
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.840]   which charges you income tax even though you're not a resident and not receiving any benefit
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.960]   from US services.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.760]   So that's the case against the US system.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:45.360]   But here's the counter argument.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.320]   As a US American, your rules for your tax obligations are much clearer than they are
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:52.640]   in Canada.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:31:00.600]   And so if you want to save money on your US taxes, all you need to do is be physically
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:06.240]   present outside of the United States at least 330 days per year.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.680]   And if you do that, you will qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, which will
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.200]   save you money on the first about $105,000 of your income.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.280]   And it's just very simple.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.280]   It's a number.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.800]   How many days are you physically present in the United States?
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.560]   Now without going into all the details, there are other ways of qualifying as well, which
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.200]   could allow you to spend up to a few months in the United States if you are a bona fide
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.560]   resident abroad.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.800]   But in your situation, you're a genuine nomad.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.720]   It can be as simple as this.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.760]   You move your legal residency to the state of South Dakota.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:44.160]   Then you get in your RV, you drive to Canada, and you spend six months in Canada in your
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.160]   RV.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.080]   And then you quickly drive through the state of the country of the United States and you
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.760]   spend six months in Mexico or five months and 29 days or whatever.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.600]   And you can get six month visas for both of those countries.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   Fairly simple.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.240]   You can do that without becoming a tax resident of Canada.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   You're not a tax resident.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   You're a tourist.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.120]   You can do that without becoming a tax resident of Mexico.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   You're not a tax resident.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.320]   You're a tourist.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.480]   And because you're physically present outside of the United States for at least 330 days,
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.600]   you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.200]   You can do that while keeping all of your infrastructure in the United States.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.880]   All your bank accounts stay the same.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:24.380]   All of your investments can stay in the United States.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.600]   Everything stays very simple.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.400]   You're a tax resident of the United States.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.040]   You just qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, which allows you to not incur federal
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.760]   income tax on your first $105,000.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.560]   Now the last piece of that is with the good tax planning, if you're willing and if your
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.840]   business qualifies, if you'll establish your business where you actually are not an employee
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:48.920]   of a US based company, although you can still maintain your US single member LLC, if you'll
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:57.520]   simply establish an offshore IBC, a company offshore, and then sell your or transfer your
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.580]   US based LLC to that offshore company, then what can happen is that that will also allow
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:05.480]   you to eliminate your employment taxes.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:11.420]   At $105,000, your employment taxes as a self-employed individual are going to be a bigger deal than
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:14.620]   your federal income taxes.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.160]   That can save you, basically on $105,000 of income, if you eliminate both of those, it'll
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.400]   save you about $30,000 a year on taxes if you're a single individual.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.280]   It doesn't cost too much and it's not too complicated.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.760]   You can keep everything in the United States and do that.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.600]   >>Trevor: Yes, that makes sense.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.400]   I should have clarified the business that I have in mind.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.040]   I think it can very much take off.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:40.560]   And so if it's a small amount of money that you're making, it doesn't make sense to have
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.120]   the company outside of the US.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.960]   But if you have plans for a sort of seven figure business like I do, I guess that's
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.680]   why I think it would make sense to have it outside the US so that if it does take off,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:34:00.280]   I can either leave for the year and take advantage of the foreign income exclusion or make the
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:05.880]   tough decision to renounce the US citizenship and have a business that's outside of the
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:10.400]   US and then also be outside of the US with presumably at that point a different passport.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.440]   >>Steve: I think you misunderstand the laws.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.200]   If you are physically living in the United States, it's very inconvenient for you to
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.480]   have an offshore company and in fact will increase your taxes.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.040]   So you've got to first establish where are you going to be.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.720]   Where are you actually going to be?
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.280]   And if you're actually going to be in the United States, you don't generally want to
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:37.440]   have an offshore corporation without understanding.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.200]   Obviously there are places for it, but it's complex and you incur significant amounts
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.160]   of taxation.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.320]   Now it's a controlled foreign corporation.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.920]   When you have a controlled foreign corporation, there's a special tax for it and it adds complexity
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.920]   to your tax returns.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:01.160]   If you are physically outside of the United States and qualify for the foreign earned
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:09.120]   income exclusion, then it's very simple for you to have a foreign corporation and that
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.880]   can be helpful for you, but it's probably unnecessarily complex.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.720]   There's not really any reason not to use your current US based LLC as the front company
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.360]   for that work.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:28.560]   There's no reason unless you're ready to go all the way offshore and you're saying my
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.840]   plan is as quickly as possible.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.520]   I'm going to get out of the United States and this business takes off.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.920]   I'm renouncing my citizenship.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:41.280]   Well, that's a situation that makes sense to go all the way to going hardcore offshore,
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.200]   but the best system for most US Americans is going to be to keep your US infrastructure,
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   which is useful.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.720]   Keep your bank accounts, keep your US LLC and just establish a foreign corporation as
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.280]   the owner of your pass through single member LLC.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:02.460]   Because what happens is that keeps your tax, that allows you to take benefit of working
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:07.680]   for a foreign corporation under the IRS rules, but from a practical perspective, it allows
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.840]   you to keep everything US based.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.160]   So you're not going to try to, you've got some, I don't know, pick your jurisdiction,
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.480]   some Belize company that you are trying to get a merchant processor for or you're trying
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   to, it's very complex.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:30.800]   And so it's simpler for you to keep your US based LLC, but just simply establish it as
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.400]   a single member LLC, wholly owned by a foreign corporation.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.920]   So from your personal tax perspective, you are working for a foreign corporation that
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:46.160]   eliminates your employment taxes, but from a business operation standpoint, everything
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.980]   is inside the United States.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.000]   So you can do that, then you can go abroad, start working on a replacement citizenship
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.080]   if you don't have one already.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.560]   And then while you're doing that, once you're in a place where you see if the business took
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:06.080]   off, then you're in a situation where, "Hey, I'm ready to go ahead and renounce citizenship."
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.760]   Now in years past, that foreign corporation was more important because prior to the Trump,
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.840]   the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, the Trump tax reform, you could retain earnings in your
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.160]   foreign corporation and not pay taxes on those.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.760]   So the way it would work prior to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is if you made a million
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:30.300]   dollars in your business, you could pay yourself a salary of $100,000.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:40.120]   That salary could come to you income tax free because subject to the foreign earned income
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.440]   exclusion.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.320]   And then you could accumulate $900,000 in your offshore corporation as long as that
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:55.880]   money stayed in the offshore corporation and did not get distributed to you, then you would
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.560]   not incur any tax, any current tax on it.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.880]   It could just stay in the foreign corporation.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:05.520]   Well after the Trump tax reform, that is no longer the case.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:10.400]   The Trump tax reform brought in a new system called the GILTI tax.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.960]   The I can't remember these stupid acronyms.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:18.200]   Anyway, it's called the GILTI tax where basically if you have retained earnings in an offshore
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.000]   corporation, then you pay a tax rate on those.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.440]   And so the simplest thing, so it all depends.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.880]   There's different, $100,000 of income is different, $300,000 of income is different, and at $3
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.120]   million of income it's different.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.000]   Because what you can do is if your income comes even higher, then what you do is you
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.800]   go ahead and establish one more piece to it and you bring in a C-Corp in the United States,
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.120]   own the offshore corporation, and the offshore corporation owns your operational LLC when
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.000]   you get higher because that will cut your overall tax rate.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.080]   But long story short, let me keep it simple.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.800]   Move to South Dakota, that's simple.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.480]   Then physically remove yourself from the United States for at least 330 days per year.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.460]   You don't have to have a residency anywhere else under those obligations.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.480]   You don't have to become a tax resident anywhere else.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.800]   If you want to be a nomad, you just find the places in the world that you want to be a
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800]   nomad.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.680]   That's three months in Mexico City, three months in Bogota, three months in Sao Paulo,
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:17.520]   and three months in, you know, two months in Toronto, and one month in the United States
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.060]   to visit family, wherever you want.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:23.140]   Any country in the world is fine, and you can do that without establishing any kind
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:24.200]   of residency visas.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.200]   You can move around.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.280]   You won't become a tax resident in those other places.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.840]   You'll just spend time in them, and then you'll be qualified for the foreign earned income
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.260]   exclusion.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:38.700]   If you have a business that's online, set up a single member LLC in the United States
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:43.640]   and set up an offshore corporation from a tax-free jurisdiction, it doesn't really matter
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.200]   what jurisdiction you use.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.960]   Pick one that's cheap and that doesn't have any tax obligation.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.320]   The reason it doesn't matter is because you do all the business through your US LLC.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.240]   So your bank accounts and things are already in the name of your US LLC.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.720]   If you already have a single member US LLC, keep everything you have because one of the
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.580]   things that's so frustrating, ask me how I know.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:07.540]   One of the things that is so frustrating in the United States is it is brutally difficult
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.760]   with all of the to get bank accounts.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:19.060]   I was denied for three different bank accounts in the United States because of my not typical
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.840]   string of patterns and information.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.720]   And the know your customer laws have become so onerous in the United States that it's
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.720]   brutal.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.460]   It's absolutely brutal.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:35.580]   It cost me huge amounts of money to get functional bank accounts and was extremely difficult.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:40.840]   So and I would say to you actually before you move to South Dakota, get all of your
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.200]   infrastructure established now.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:51.980]   So make sure you have all the bank accounts, all the credit cards, everything already established
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.280]   now, including for your business.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.980]   Then when you go offshore, then you go ahead, do your move after everything's established
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:02.360]   and you've got multiple backups, everything is good.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:09.380]   Credit cards, bank accounts, have backup bank accounts, have normal profiles on everything,
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.060]   just have everything ready to go.
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.460]   Have all that stuff.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.860]   Then do two things.
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:19.340]   Move to South Dakota and then establish your offshore corporation and all you need to do
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:30.300]   is just simply establish a what's it called in your LLC?
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:31.300]   Resolution.
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:35.220]   Just establish a resolution in your LLC to transfer your single member LLC out of your
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:41.680]   name into a foreign IBC that you own.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:45.540]   And so if you'll just simply do that one thing and you'll transfer your single member LLC
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:52.380]   in the US to a foreign IBC, from the IRS perspective, a single member LLC is a disregarded entity.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:57.220]   And so what happens is because your single member LLC is a disregarded entity, you now
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:04.620]   file as an employee of a foreign IBC, which allows you to eliminate your self-employment
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:08.180]   tax.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.140]   But the banks and everything else, as long as you have all the infrastructure done in
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:15.820]   advance, you, I shouldn't say that because there probably is some kind of regulation
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:23.020]   that you're supposed to notify them if there's a change of ownership.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:27.580]   Nobody but the IRS has to know that you have an offshore corporation is basically the same
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:31.400]   scenario and that will make your life a lot simpler and a lot easier.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:35.500]   So those are my answers to you.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:42.580]   Publicly speaking also, I have done all of Bazell's solutions and once you start, as
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:48.180]   far as I've tested all of his recommendations, but what I'll tell you is that from an international
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:54.140]   perspective, it's very difficult to maintain some of those things when you go abroad.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:03.660]   So when I went abroad, I had this whole extravagant, intricate communication system set up.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:07.500]   It utterly failed when I went abroad.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:11.860]   And so what I'll tell you is if I were going to go back and, I mean, I don't necessarily
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:16.180]   want to do all this live on the show, but if you get with me privately and book a consulting
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.320]   call or something, I'll go through all the details of what works going abroad and what
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.140]   doesn't work and I'll save you a huge amount of hassle.
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:27.540]   Because some of that, all of his stuff works awesome in the United States and you can use
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.620]   some of it when traveling.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:32.100]   I'm not saying that you can't use it when traveling.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:39.740]   You can, but it gets, it's stuff gets messed up and so you need some more mainstream solutions
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:40.820]   that work better when traveling.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.420]   We'll leave it there publicly for now.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.420]   Understood.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.420]   Sounds good.
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:45.420]   That helpful?
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:46.420]   Did I answer your question?
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.420]   It does.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:50.580]   Yeah, I think we're on the same page here and, you know, hey, go where you're treated
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.580]   best.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.580]   I agree.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:59.520]   And I'll tell you, it's from a freedom perspective, as a freedom lover, this will be offensive
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:06.620]   to many Americans and I hate that it is, but I feel generally far freer outside of the
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.340]   United States than I do inside the United States.
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:15.500]   And as I've talked about when I've done shows on, you know, PT theory, et cetera, I feel
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.940]   much freer outside the United States than I do in the United States.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.540]   And it's nice to have options.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:26.460]   One of the things that has happened as I built an offshore structure, as I built options,
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:32.540]   as I built other places to live and paths to residency and citizenship, et cetera, it's
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.540]   not easy.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:34.540]   It's not cheap.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:40.300]   It's expensive and hard and time consuming, but it has allowed me to feel much more relaxed
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:43.780]   about all the stuff in the United States.
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:48.660]   I feel much more disconnected from it because I'm not, I don't feel like I'm a slave to
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:49.660]   it anymore.
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:54.900]   You know, I feel much more relaxed about, you know, whoever is elected president and
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.900]   all this stuff and I still care deeply about that stuff.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:05.500]   I care because, I care because number one, I'm sad for what the United States of America
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:09.820]   used to be, what it could be, kind of the bones of the country that I see as really
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:11.620]   awesome.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:18.380]   I'm sad for what it could be and I feel a deep connection to my fellow compatriots,
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:24.980]   to my fellow citizens, to, I feel a deep connection to American citizens.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:29.460]   But in terms of the practicality of it, if I ever renounced my citizenship, I would still
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:33.540]   feel that same sense of care and connection to American citizens.
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:40.380]   But it would be, it just doesn't make sense to rely on one jurisdiction, on one country
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.260]   to try to, you know, do all that stuff for you.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:44.860]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:49.860]   And if you have the ability to do it without it harming your lifestyle, I highly recommend
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:50.860]   it.
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:51.860]   I agree.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.700]   The most patriotic thing you can do with an out-of-control government that craps all over
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.540]   the Constitution is to boycott it.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:58.540]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:00.020]   And it's also the most peaceful thing, you know.
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:05.580]   I'm not, if I were a state, I think that, you know, places like New York, right, I think
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.780]   that they're paying attention finally to people leaving the country, sorry, to people leaving
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.780]   the state.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:14.380]   I think that the state of California, I don't know, that was too, maybe that's a step too
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.380]   far.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:18.180]   I think that New York and New Jersey are paying attention to it.
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:23.300]   And when I look at, you know, how do I make my voice known about my displeasure about
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:28.140]   this thing, I don't know, I'm not going to fight, I'm not going to pick up a gun, I'm
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.660]   not going to engage in violence.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:34.000]   So I can speak up, I can exercise my freedom of speech and do that.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.140]   But at the end of the day, it's not effective, right.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.900]   And there's so many people that speak, I mean, in the election season, everyone's like, "Well,
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:45.060]   so and so is elected president, I'm moving to Canada."
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:46.820]   They don't ever do it.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.820]   It's stupid.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.300]   Everyone knows it because they don't do it.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:54.820]   And so the most effective thing that you can do is genuinely to go.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:59.900]   And then, and I don't expect to make much of a difference, but if you do leave, it does
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.940]   establish, it does speak clearly.
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:10.000]   And I think it's the peaceful way to handle, the peaceful and moral way to handle significant
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.460]   differences of agreement.
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.460]   Well said.
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.460]   Thanks, Josh.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:16.460]   Thank you for being here.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.460]   All right.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.580]   For our last call today, we go down to the state of Illinois.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:20.580]   Welcome to the show.
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:21.580]   How can I serve you today?
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:22.940]   Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:23.940]   Go ahead.
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.940]   All right.
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.580]   Hey, hopefully you didn't cover this.
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   I doubt it.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:29.620]   I just got on.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.580]   Through a number of different encouragers, especially you, or at least including you,
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:38.180]   I started a keto type diet recently and have had a lot of success.
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:42.300]   But I've also started sort of emergency prepping recently.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.140]   And I found that those two things are kind of difficult to do because a lot of the stuff
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.660]   that's easy to store isn't very compatible with what I've been eating.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.300]   I just didn't know if you thought about that.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.980]   I know you kind of are in both worlds.
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:55.900]   I kind of wanted to see if you had any input for me.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.820]   I've thought extensively about it.
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:03.580]   If I were starving or if I were going to face, if I were, if I were starving or if I were
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:11.060]   going to face severe risk of infection by leaving my house, I would very happily eat
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.060]   rice.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.220]   I would very happily eat bread.
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.540]   I would very happily eat all those things and I would have to serve those to my children.
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:26.420]   It is a historical blessing to be in a situation where we can be so picky with what we eat.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.500]   Throughout the vast majority of human civilization and throughout the vast majority of the world,
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:34.100]   you ate the food that was available to you and you were thankful to have it.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:39.580]   And so I feel like a stuck up snob with my food opinions based upon the way that much
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:43.860]   of the world eats, even with regard to the amount of money that I spend on food.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:52.140]   And so I think that the vast majority of, the vast majority of long-term storage food
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:57.140]   is a total blessing to have and can keep me and my family alive and happy and our tummies
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:01.700]   full if we needed it and it can keep our neighbors alive.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:05.660]   And I think it's cheap and it's a miracle of the modern world that I can stock up on
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.420]   that kind of stuff at pennies on the dollar.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:11.940]   And I think it's irresponsible not to have huge amounts of that kind of food set aside
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.880]   and stored for hard times.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.380]   So that's point one.
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:22.620]   Point two, and in an emergency, I'm not going to worry about how fat I am.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:26.440]   I'm going to worry about how much, how many calories I have.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.660]   Does long-term health matter?
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.420]   Yeah, of course it matters.
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.460]   So maybe the keto diet is more healthy or less healthy, who knows?
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:37.260]   Maybe it's more healthy, but in a short-term emergency, I'm more worried about staying
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:41.860]   alive and staying fed than I am worried about the long-term impact of a diet.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.220]   So that's thing one.
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:51.940]   Thing two, you can store lots of keto-friendly foods if you have the right storage mechanisms.
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:59.220]   And so the key is it's a little bit harder to store for most people, but it is possible.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:06.220]   And so your friend, if you are having a meat-heavy, low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, your friend
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.700]   is a freezer, a deep freezer.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   And so right now, if you were to go to my house and open my freezer, you would find
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.900]   that the entire freezer is full of meat.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:20.480]   And we cannot put anything in the freezer because it is completely full of meat.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.340]   And it's all stocked up for hard times.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:30.220]   It's all stocked up for a corona quarantine, but I can eat steak and beef and pork and
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:35.300]   chicken and I can eat that stuff for months based upon what is stored in my freezer.
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:38.900]   And that's the primary foundation, which is interesting because if you go to a more carnivore
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:42.660]   style, low-carbohydrate, it's hard to do.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:46.680]   You can't actually do keto high-fat on carnivore really very well.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:51.460]   But if you go to like a carnivore style of eating, it makes things profoundly simple.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:55.500]   If all you eat is meat, all you have to store is meat and you can store meat basically indefinitely
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.500]   in a freezer.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:02.040]   And so what I do is I buy meat and I go ahead and because I have experience getting some
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.540]   freezer burn in the past, I make sure that I package the food for no freezer burn.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:10.700]   What I do, and this is easier in some places if you can purchase it from a butcher and
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:12.420]   it all comes in butcher paper, etc.
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:19.820]   But what I usually do is I repackage all the meat in vacuum seal bags and I package it
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:22.460]   ready to go into sous vide cooker.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:24.100]   And so it makes things really simple.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:28.940]   I buy a big chunk of meat, I cut it into steaks, I put the number of steaks that my family
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:34.180]   eats into a freezer bag, I season them, then I vacuum seal it and put it in the freezer.
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:37.700]   And then if I want to make steak for dinner, all I need to do is sometime in the afternoon,
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:41.300]   one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, doesn't really matter, I just go ahead and grab a
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:46.980]   frozen bag of steak out of the freezer and then plop it in the sous vide cooker and cook
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:50.740]   it for a couple hours or whatever until dinner time, sear it and serve it.
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:52.200]   And so that makes things really simple.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:55.060]   So the answer is a freezer.
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.380]   Freezer also works well with vegetables.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.420]   So you can store huge amounts of vegetables in a freezer.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:10.260]   You can buy bags of pre-made freezer, bags of pre-made frozen vegetables from Costco
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.260]   and such.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:13.860]   It's not necessarily the most cost-effective, but of course it's normal food and if you
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.820]   have a deep freezer you can do that.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:20.100]   The fat is where things can be more difficult, but then you can easily store fat, whether
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.460]   it's in the form of oil, whether it's in the form of butter.
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.420]   Butter freezes beautifully.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:29.540]   You could also buy canned butter or ghee, and so you can get your fats through some
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.540]   of those.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:35.100]   Some of the nuts also store well, just in standard long-term food, and so those are
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:36.220]   good solutions.
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:42.740]   And then the nice thing about kind of a keto, non-keto, primal, paleo type of eating is
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:45.740]   that it actually works really well with food production.
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.060]   So if you have a source of meat, you can store all your meat alive and then when you need
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.860]   it you kill it and eat it.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:55.880]   And that can be done on a small property with small animals.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:59.500]   So if you're going to be a hardcore prepper and you want to eat healthy, well the answer
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.420]   is obviously animals.
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.740]   So small animals are extremely convenient because they're in perfect serving sizes.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:10.820]   If that's rabbits, if that's chickens, if that's quail, if it's guinea pigs, any kind
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:14.860]   of small animal like that is really convenient to store alive until you need it.
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:19.460]   And so if you're going to be really, if you're worried about a grid down scenario, you don't
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:25.220]   have a freezer, etc., the simplest way to store your meat is alive, and then just take
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.180]   it in small portions when you need it.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:31.380]   This is also where the benefit goes to smaller animals versus larger animals.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:35.100]   You know a small goat will serve you for a reasonable number of meals.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.780]   It's a lot harder to preserve a large cow.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:43.260]   So you need the freezing and so if you're going to, you either need to freeze or to
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:50.260]   can or to jerk or to dry or to salt, some other way of preserving large animals.
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:54.800]   But it works really well, kind of a keto style diet works really well with animal production
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.820]   on a property or around you, and it works really well with vegetable production, vegetable
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:04.340]   and fruit production, because those are things that you can store your keto food in the form
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.740]   of seeds and grow it little by little as you need it.
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:10.980]   Obviously more work associated, but those are my answers to you.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:12.460]   And then there are other technologies.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:14.660]   You can can vegetables, you can can meat.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.900]   One of the things that I've done in the past when I was working on this, I wanted to can
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:18.900]   meat.
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:24.420]   So I went and I bought big 40 pound boxes of chicken from the restaurant supply store,
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.020]   and I just went ahead and canned it myself.
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:30.660]   It's hard to find, if you want to go and buy commercially pre-canned, pre-tinned, you know
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:36.260]   canned stuff, you can generally find that with obviously tuna fish and canned chicken.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:40.860]   It's hard to find canned beef, but you can go ahead and can, or I don't know why they
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:42.700]   call it can, it should be called jar.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.860]   You can go ahead and jar beef yourself if you want to store it at shelf stable in a
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:47.580]   shelf stable way, and I've done that.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:50.660]   It just requires a lot of work.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:54.820]   And then finally, then if you're willing to spend the money on freeze-dried food, then
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:58.200]   the freeze-dried food can certainly solve that problem as well.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:03.620]   You can buy every kind of meat, freeze-dried meat, and/or you can buy dehydrated or freeze-dried
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:08.040]   vegetables and you can store the food very effectively for decades in that form.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   So those are your answers.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.040]   >>Steve: Good, appreciate it.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.720]   Hey, did you make it home?
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.720]   >>Aaron: Not yet.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:17.560]   I'm sitting in a hotel room wondering if I'm, as soon as I hang up, I moved my flight up,
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:22.720]   and so I'm just hoping that I don't turn on the internet and see more travel restrictions,
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.440]   otherwise I got problems and I'll have an adventure getting home.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.480]   So if Joshua's not on the air next week, you know that he's swimming across the ocean trying
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:31.480]   to get home.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.640]   >>Steve: All right, we're praying for you, man.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.500]   >>Aaron: Thank you very much.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.700]   And with that, I think we have an appropriate way to close out today's show.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.700]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:45.040]   I hope that you've enjoyed today's Q&A.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.640]   One of the nice things, I'll be here for you.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.280]   If I'm locked in my house, I'm going to be doing a lot more, so I'm here to work with
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.980]   you in the coming days.
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:58.960]   Looking forward to, well, we got difficult times ahead, but I'm looking forward to being
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.640]   here with you day after day.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.560]   If you have found value in today's show, I'd ask you for a few things.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:07.060]   Number one, please go and take a moment and rate and review the show on whatever platform
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.320]   you're listening to me.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.940]   That's super helpful when you do that.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:11.860]   That's free, doesn't cost you a thing.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:17.880]   Number two is I would love it if you would join me on Patreon at patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.240]   So helpful when you join me there, and that also will give you access to these Q&A calls,
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.560]   which I thank you for that.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.000]   And then number three, a couple of the listeners have talked about some of the courses that
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000]   I have available.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.680]   You can find out all of those courses at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.880]   I have three courses there at the moment.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.880]   Let me tell you about them.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.880]   Don't skip forward too fast.
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:40.160]   Just give me a moment, because what you'll see is how useful they are in this particular
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.080]   event that we're facing.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:45.000]   The first course that I released that's still on the store there is called How to Borrow
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.280]   Money Safely and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:53.720]   And in that course I will teach you how to establish a large credit card portfolio, which
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:58.880]   gives you large amounts of access to credit, while also teaching you how to do it at a
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.960]   very low cost so you don't wind up paying stupid interest rates.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:07.760]   You borrow the money at 0% or a maximum of something like 3% in some cases.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.140]   The key is you've got to do that long before you need it.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:15.920]   And so as you heard with the listener who was talking about a 401(k), he's already taken
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.680]   action on that, and so he has other sources of money.
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.320]   And so it's safer for him to keep his money in the 401(k), move it to a cash account so
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.160]   it's stable, and then if he needs financing, just go ahead and use credit cards for financing.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.480]   And the point is that if he needs money all of a sudden, and he can always take the money
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.940]   from the 401(k) and distribute it later, but by not doing it while he's working, he puts
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:43.940]   himself in a better tax situation where he's not making distributions out while he's working.
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:49.400]   Let's say that he takes a, in his case he was doing a loan, which I acknowledge that.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.920]   But it's much better for him to have the credit card portfolio, and then if he gets laid off
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.800]   or something like that, then when his income is down, then he goes ahead and takes the
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.320]   distribution from the 401(k).
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.840]   That course was developed about two years ago.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:04.280]   Everything in it is still relevant today, and it's been a good one.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.460]   And we'll make options for you.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:10.680]   And especially as we go into what I think will be recession in the coming months, you
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:14.080]   want to make sure that you have large amounts of credit available to you.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.080]   Do not use your credit for consumption.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:20.160]   If you do that, you wind up in a bind.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.900]   But you can use your credit to live on if you have an emergency situation, or possibly
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.840]   to take advantage of an opportunity to start a business, etc.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:32.000]   And one of the things that I teach in that course is simply how to do cash management
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.840]   and how to manage cash as compared to credit.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.240]   I don't want anybody to wind up deeply in debt.
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:38.800]   I'm opposed to that.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:42.440]   But there are many situations in which you can simultaneously say, "I don't want to be
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:46.800]   in debt," while also having credit cards.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:51.160]   In addition, if you have credit card debt right now, you need to get that cleared right
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.840]   now in preparation for recession.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:58.120]   And that course is all about how to help you do that cheaper, faster, and safer along the
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.120]   way.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.640]   I know it sounds like these things are in opposition.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:04.960]   And I agree that in some cases they can be in opposition, but they don't have to be.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.080]   So check that course out at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/store.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:13.440]   The second course that is available is the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career and
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.600]   Income Planning.
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:18.280]   And that is all about how to build a job that's going to pay you a lot of money that you don't
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.880]   want to retire from.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:24.600]   And the number one priority that you have in a recession is not to lose your job, which
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.280]   is where that course comes in.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:30.860]   Now I've done public shows on that as well, but if you are in a situation where you're
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:35.680]   worried about your job, you better get involved in building your income so that you can maintain
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.680]   it.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:39.760]   You better have a plan for transitioning to a new job.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.680]   In the call that was talked about, "Should I go to these side businesses?"
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:47.780]   You can see how valuable it is if you know how to maintain your presence and maintain
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:50.620]   a business while you're transitioning to other things.
[01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:54.380]   And so we talk about those subjects in the Guide to Career and Income Planning.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:58.880]   Number three is how to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis.
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:02.440]   And that show I released last year, and it was all about how to survive and thrive during
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.320]   the coming economic crisis.
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:08.640]   And in that show, I laid out all of the strategies that you need, or in that course, I laid out
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.320]   all the strategies that you need to survive during an economic crisis.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:16.520]   Now I used a sensationalistic title to try to sell more of it so that I can make more
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:19.880]   money, but it's a very practical course.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.920]   We are going into economic crisis.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.040]   It might be short and shallow.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.100]   I don't think it'll be short and shallow, but it might be.
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:30.600]   It might be hard and deep and long.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:33.320]   I expect it to be hard and deep and long.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:37.760]   But it is not too late to prepare for economic crisis.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:42.000]   It is time to prepare for economic crisis if you have not previously prepared.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.040]   The best time to prepare was two years ago.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.600]   Best time to prepare was a year ago.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:51.120]   But it's still time to prepare because I don't see how this does not become a national and
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.840]   international economic crisis.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:01:00.840]   Now hopefully it will be light and short and shallow, you know, little upturn in unemployment.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.080]   Hopefully there'll be some medical solutions quickly.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:04.680]   I hope that's the case.
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:06.200]   I don't think it will be.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:09.920]   And so I need you to be prepared for that and there's still time.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:15.120]   What you need to be looking at is recognizing how while there's plenty of toilet paper on
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.600]   the shelves, sorry, while there's no toilet paper on the shelves because people are panicking
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.360]   hysterically about toilet paper, there's plenty of other things.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.560]   And so if you're not stocked up, if you're worried about things and you don't have things
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.640]   stockpiled, please, I'm not teaching fear.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.320]   I'm not trying to get you to spend money stupidly.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.880]   But there are a lot of things that you can do to prepare your family for hard times and
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:41.240]   you should be doing those things.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:47.200]   Put simply, in addition to that, you need an internationalization plan.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.320]   As you heard with the caller where we talked about going abroad, you need an internationalization
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:53.320]   plan.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.240]   Let's say that, remember the caller earlier today, I think it was Jordan, where she was
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:59.000]   talking about what would happen if she's got these businesses.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.280]   Jordan has the ability to do that business from anywhere in the world.
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:03.760]   So use this as an example.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:07.840]   Let's say that Jordan makes the move to their new businesses and then her husband loses
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.760]   their safe and secure job.
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.640]   What's she going to do in that situation?
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:17.260]   Well they might decide that it's best for her to go back and get her $130,000 a year
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:18.280]   job back.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.240]   But maybe she's making $40,000 or $30,000 on the side with her side businesses.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:27.600]   If Jordan and her husband have a good internationalization plan, then they can just simply move out of
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.120]   their house, rent it out, and they can go to a lower cost of living area.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:34.800]   This might be difficult with coronavirus because lower cost of living areas might be more dangerous
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.320]   in a global flu pandemic.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:46.120]   But Jordan may be able to just simply go to Mexico City, go to Chiang Mai, Thailand, famously
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.560]   Chiang Mai, Thailand.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:51.480]   If the coronavirus is everywhere, then they might go to Chiang Mai, Thailand where they
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:58.200]   can live on $1,500 a month very comfortably and be able to live and work there while she's
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.480]   just simply living off of their income.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:02.960]   And they can come back from that with new businesses growing, etc.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.800]   And so internationalization gives you plans for backup plans in bad economies.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:11.200]   Internationalization gives you plans for backup sources of income.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:17.760]   Maybe the economy in the United States totally implodes, but the economy in maybe South Korea
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:24.000]   does a much better job of handling the coronavirus than the United States does.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.320]   And so South Korea recovers more quickly.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.600]   Well, if you have the ability and the skills to live and work in South Korea, most people
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:34.560]   don't, but if you did have that, then that provides a good situation for you to be able
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.960]   to go and live and work there.
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:40.000]   Or the caller who was talking about the French passport, if you have set up where you have
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.800]   an EU passport and maybe your college funds implode in the United States or the healthcare
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.160]   system is overwhelmed in the United States, but you have an EU passport, you can take
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.240]   your kids to school in the EU, you have options.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.960]   And so that's one of the things I teach is a lot of internationalization in that course.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.880]   It's a really good course.
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:01.360]   I think I've only—I don't remember—I think I probably had one refund on it and I've had
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.600]   a lot of students in that course.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.080]   All of them have been satisfied.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:08.400]   So please give it a shot at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:14.600]   And then finally, I am still in the middle of teaching this class on family preparedness.
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:20.400]   And that was a cheap course on just basic preparedness, so things like food storage,
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:21.400]   etc.
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:24.360]   And I've been delayed this week on getting new courses out, but there are new courses
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:25.360]   still coming.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.360]   You can still register for that.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.120]   Go to radicalpreparedness.com.
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.480]   And in those live courses, if you're saying, "Hey, Joshua, I can't find toilet paper.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:33.480]   What do I do?"
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.480]   I'll teach you what to do.
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.760]   Or if you say, "I can't find food because the shelves are bare.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.120]   Teach you what to do."
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.520]   If you look out the digital window today, you can see how important some of these things
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:44.520]   are.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.520]   So there's a time and a place.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.440]   I'm going to be doing courses and whatnot in the future on life insurance, etc.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:53.680]   But I started with these because I have been concerned for the last few years about preparing
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.120]   you for what you see right now.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.160]   Now, I desperately hope I'm wrong.
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:00.560]   I desperately hope I'm wrong.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.680]   I don't think I am.
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:04.960]   And so I have been concerned about this for the last few years, which is why you can see
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:10.400]   the theme in all of these courses fit together because I've wanted you to be prepared.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:17.400]   Because if you are prepared, you can go into a crisis and you can weather it in comfort
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:25.480]   and you can use it as an opportunity to move you to more and more wealth.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.840]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/store.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.840]   Give them a try.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:30.560]   A 30-day money-back guarantee on all of them.
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:36.440]   So hey, if you're cheap and a little bit unethical, but hey, you'll be following the rules.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.200]   Just buy the course, get the information, and then I don't know, I guess I'll get a
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.200]   refund.
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.200]   I hope you don't do that.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.400]   I hope you like it enough and you say, "I can see I can make tons of money on this."
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:45.760]   But go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/store.
