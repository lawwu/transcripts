[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Here's a question from an Ask Pastor John podcast listener in Norway who writes in,
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.280]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for all that you have done for the kingdom and for this
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   podcast.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.800]   I have a question regarding child rearing.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.400]   You have formerly said that you would go to jail over the issue of spanking.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.520]   I agree with you that spanking is biblical, but in my home country, Norway, as well as
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.860]   in many other countries, spanking is illegal.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.800]   The consequences would then not only be that one may have to go to jail, but that the government
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.860]   would take your children.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.660]   This has now happened in the famous Boudinario case, where a couple in Norway lost their
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540]   children after spanking them.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.320]   In cases such as these, one may never get one's children back again because the government
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.180]   may not see you as a suitable parent because you spanked your children.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.360]   What would you do as a Christian parent in Norway?
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.740]   Wouldn't it be better to not spank your children and be sure that your children will
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.460]   never be taken away from you?
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.580]   This is a big issue with huge consequences for us in Norway."
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.380]   Well, that's for sure.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.060]   This is an important thing and has great consequence.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.180]   And Norway is not the only country.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.420]   You can go online and see a graph of the countries in Europe and around the world where it's
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.900]   illegal to spank, and that is only increasing.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.060]   I read about the Boudinario case, or however it's pronounced in Norwegian.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.900]   I'm sorry if I'm butchering it.
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.660]   I read about that case some time ago and came away from it.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.140]   The government took away five children from this family with, in my judgment, it seemed
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.340]   no evidence of child abuse.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.100]   I came away from that story feeling the way Jesus did in Mark 3, 5, where it says, "He
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.940]   looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart."
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.740]   Anger and grief, anger and grief, the mingling of those two emotions.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.260]   You can't help but feel in this kind of situation.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.020]   All five children seized by the Norwegian government, and as far as I can tell, no evidence
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020]   of child abuse.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.660]   It's an ideological difference about the best way to raise your kids.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.940]   And yes, I have said that I would go to jail over this.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.860]   In other words, if they wanted to put me in prison because I believe that the best way
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.120]   to love my children was to spank them, sometimes when they were disobedient, I wouldn't sacrifice
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.620]   that conviction or that behavior to stay out of jail.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.780]   But of course, that kind of protest and threat is of no use when the person about to be put
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.900]   in jail is not yourself but your children.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.300]   And yes, I know they're not being put in jail, but the point is it's similar.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.740]   They're being legally kidnapped from the family and put in places they don't want to be.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.220]   And so the willingness of the parents to go to jail is not the issue anymore.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.300]   So probably when I said that, I wasn't thinking as realistically as is proving to be the case.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.780]   So the question for our friend in Norway, and other countries I'm sure, should we risk
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.780]   losing our children to the high-handed tactics of the state, or should we relent in spanking
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.460]   our children?
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.260]   And of course, there are many related questions that Christians in Norway and other countries
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.460]   are facing, like what does a pastor preach?
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.740]   I don't know what the legal ramifications are if he preaches true biblical teaching.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.640]   Does he tell the people what the Bible says and encourage them to obey, or does he just
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.300]   ignore parts of the Bible, or does he show them how to compromise?
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.740]   How do parents teach their children the scriptures?
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.740]   Do they skip those parts of the Bible in telling their children how to raise their children?
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.780]   And if they teach their children, what will they say if the children say, "Well, why don't
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.620]   you spank us since the Bible says you should?"
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.180]   Now, of course, the issues are far deeper than simply the nature of parental discipline.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.980]   There is a view of human nature at work here that will have repercussions everywhere.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.340]   There is a view of how to restrain bad behavior and get good behavior from children that the
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:53.360]   state evidently thinks is less psychologically damaging than simple, measured, loving spanking.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.700]   And of course, the issue here is not merely how kids behave in later life.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.060]   Are they well-adjusted or maladjusted?
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:12.220]   That's not the main issue, but rather how they view the whole world, especially themselves
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.100]   and God.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.020]   That's the great issue, which of course the Norwegian government does not take into account,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.780]   but which is the most important issue in the world.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.460]   God himself, according to Hebrews 12, uses corporal punishment, and treating kids differently
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.540]   will not serve well to help them know God and love God and believe in the God of Hebrews
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.300]   12 and his holiness and his mercy.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.140]   Of course, governments don't take into account these great issues.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:54.100]   They're only thinking at a very narrow, natural, historical, societal level, not a cosmic level,
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.780]   not an eternal level that includes heaven and hell and salvation and obedience to God
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.540]   and eternal destinies and the exaltation of the glory of God.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.660]   None of that matters to governments, but it should matter infinitely to Christian parents.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.460]   So if I lived in Norway, what would I do?
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.380]   Well, I know I would pray earnestly for wisdom.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:24.020]   I would not assume that this is a simple either/or situation.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.060]   God is a God of wonders.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.260]   God's a God of miracles.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.800]   He has ways out of dilemmas that seem hopeless.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.240]   We can't think of any alternatives, but he can.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.980]   He splits the Red Sea.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.380]   That was an alternative nobody thought of.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.740]   He stopped the sun in the sky.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.860]   That was an alternative nobody thought of.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.100]   He raises the dead.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.980]   He walks on water.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.780]   All things are possible with God.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.980]   So I would pray earnestly that God would show me a way to be obedient to God and keep, keep,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.060]   keep my children.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.780]   And if I really had to choose between spanking my children and losing them to the state,
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:13.060]   and I knew it was a necessary choice, of course, I would choose keeping my children over spanking
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060]   them.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.580]   That's the answer he was looking for, probably.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:25.820]   This is not choosing disobedience over obedience, because it would be disobedient to surrender
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.540]   your children to the state.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.860]   One thing is crystal clear in the Bible is that God holds parents accountable for the
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:40.180]   raising of their children, not the state, which leads to one other consideration, and
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:47.060]   that is leaving a country where you can't exercise your faith legally.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.460]   America was founded by people who did that.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.540]   They left their homelands so that they could exercise their faith in the way that they
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.300]   thought they should, and they were coming to an absolute wilderness, and half of them
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.700]   died in the process, which shows how important it was.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:14.660]   And I have had people come to my church here in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, from Europe,
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.420]   because they wanted to homeschool their children and weren't allowed to in the country they
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.820]   came from.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.800]   So I know it's happening today.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.300]   So I will pray, I will pray for my brothers and sisters in lands like Norway, where increasingly
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:38.180]   unjust and evil laws put the Christian between two terrible choices.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:45.180]   And we're all moving toward that situation, and we will need great courage and great wisdom.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.540]   These international questions are so very helpful.
