[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Roger, you should talk about big data, but I'm happy to talk about where I think the origin
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.080]   story of data science comes from. Yeah, let's start with that. And then I want to hear about
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.880]   the origin story of big data and then what I should trademark and what domain names I should buy.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:23.680]   Totally. So part of the thing of data people, especially in that early era of LinkedIn and
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.320]   Facebook and others, was that there was a community starting to form of people getting together.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.320]   And what do you call themselves? And so people had many different versions of names that were going
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.600]   on. And even going back to the '60s, there's been arguments with people where they found
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.440]   documentation of people titling things data science. And so it's been floating around.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.240]   And I wouldn't be surprised if we find a lot more examples of what people had been
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   calling data science. What was also going on at the same time is people were trying to figure
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.360]   this out. People were playing around with the terms like analytics scientists. And Jonathan
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.680]   Goldman was the guy who came up with that. Pete Skomorach was talking about the idea of a data
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.440]   artist. And that actually got raised at a board meeting at LinkedIn, was like, are we painting a
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.320]   palette? Are we creating a palette with that? What I recall is, and what we put in our book,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.880]   when we were getting ready for the IPO for LinkedIn, Facebook was it, Jeff Hammerbacher
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   and I both got together. And we were like, hey, HR is breathing down both of our necks.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.640]   What do we call people? Because we had too many different job titles. And so it was like, well,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   what's the listing? And what actually went through those is you start to think about the terms.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.560]   Analyst felt a little too Wall Street. Research scientist was a title that Yahoo had really
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.960]   popularized for where the data scientists sat with Kymer Marlow and other people.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.480]   But they've kind of always pushed out to the side of the product process or the product engineering
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   process. And so there was kind of like a little too researchy. If you kind of go with some of
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.200]   the things more statistician or economics or any of those, you're creating a war right off the bat.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.880]   But also the term hadn't really quite caught on except for places like at Google with
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.040]   how variants team. And so what we did is we kind of went to that list. Jeff actually was the one
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   who kind of was like, well, we're starting to think about this term data scientist.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.040]   And what I took it back to, it was like, well, that seems plenty reasonable. I took it back to
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.960]   the team and Monica Ragati actually had the idea of saying, well, we are LinkedIn. We have all the
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   job postings. Let's post all the jobs with the different titles and see what everyone applies to.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.120]   And so we did that. Monica actually constructed the test for it. And guess what? Everyone we hired
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.720]   was in the term data scientist. And so that's why it sticks. And so I think a lot of people have
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   gotten caught up in this origin story, but I think there's two parts that are important. One,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   it exemplifies that this was a team effort. It's very easy for people to say, oh, DJ and Jeff did
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.880]   this. It's a community-wide thing. This was a broad, diverse community that was all coming
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.560]   together to make this happen. The second is, why did it take off? And not only did we sort of data
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   science our way into this title, but the reason I think it takes off is because no one knows what
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   the hell it means. And I say that with great seriousness, because-- and Roger knows-- is you
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840]   kind of watch these fields evolve. And you've seen this, Lucas, tremendous amount through all your
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.600]   work over the years. People like to put people in boxes. They like to put skill sets in the boxes.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.720]   And they're like, oh, if you're doing data, you're not supposed to do product. If you're doing
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.800]   product, you're not supposed to do engineering. And we're sort of like, why can't we do it all
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.600]   if we've got the skill set? And the data scientist person, people are kind of like, OK, they're smart
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.640]   and they have superpowers. We don't understand them, but they really add value. And if you kind
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.840]   of pull on that string of why do they add value, the reason, finally, is because they're allowed
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.280]   in the room and they have context. And once you have context, you can take your skills and apply
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.880]   it to the problem faster than other people can. If you're enjoying Gradient Dissent, I'd really
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.920]   love for you to check out Fully Connected, which is an inclusive machine learning community that
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.280]   we're building to let everyone know about all the stuff going on in ML and all the new research
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.600]   coming out. If you go to WMB.ai/fc, you can see all the different stuff that we do, including
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.720]   Gradient Dissent, but also salons where we talk about new research and folks share insights,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.080]   AMAs where you can directly connect with members of our community, and a Slack channel where you
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.920]   can get answers to everything from very basic questions about ML to bug reports on weights
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.960]   and biases to how to hire an ML team. We're looking forward to meeting you.
