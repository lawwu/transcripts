[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 60.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   I got some stuff wrong, and you need to know about it.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   [Music]
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.600]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I thank you for being here.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.800]   Today is Friday, September the 12th, 2014. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   On today's show, I'm going to talk about some stuff I got wrong,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   and give you guys some most excellent questions to consider where you want to go over the next few years.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   Hope you find it beneficial.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   [Music]
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   I thank you for being here on a beautiful Friday.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   First off, right off the bat, those of you who are regular listeners, you may be able to hear in my voice, I apologize that A)
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   I haven't been here for you the last couple days, and B) I apologize that my voice is a little bit wonky.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   I didn't get the show put out on Thursday, or Wednesday. I had the previously scheduled interview show lined up,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   and that was all pre-recorded, ready to launch live on Thursday, so that went out on schedule.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   But early Wednesday morning, I woke up right in the middle of the night and had to throw up right in the middle of the night.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   It was most unpleasant.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   And just out of the blue, don't know where it came from, and then was flat on my back for a day and a half,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   and then pretty weak for the next half a day.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   So I lost two days of work that I had planned.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   By the way, if this is your first show joining me, either go back a day or go forward a day,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   because this show is going to be of interest to those who are regular listeners,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   but it's not going to be of interest to you if this is your first show.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   So again, go back a day or go forward a day.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   This is going to build on a lot of other shows and correct some things that I've gotten wrong in other shows,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   and then also it's going to be for the regular listeners.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   So I woke up and was sick for two days, and just out of the blue, hadn't been ignoring my health,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   hadn't been not taking care of myself, just got sick and doing better now, but my voice is still recovering.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   So that put quite a hitch in my plans.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   I'd been working hard to have shows lined up for you guys while I was away for the next two weeks,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   already had some interview shows lined up and scheduled for this next week,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   and so those were all lined up, all the interview shows pre-recorded, the intros and outros done, ready to go.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   And then I had show notes and outlines set for five individual shows that were going to be recorded,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   so I had everything lined up, but being flat on my back Wednesday and Thursday resulted in my not being able to do that.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   And then I messed up the count because I had the shows already pre-prepared.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   So if you go back and you look in your show notes, or go back and look in your podcast feed,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   if you go back and see Wednesday's show, I've inserted a show for Wednesday after the fact,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   and I think you should check that one out.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   It's a special sick day show.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   I don't like to have--I just want to have a show here every day.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   It's important to me, but they don't have to all be the same.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   So Wednesday is just a very short nine-minute excerpt from an interview that I found very interesting with Kevin Kelly on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   It's a nine-minute excerpt.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   I think you'll enjoy that.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   So if you are listening day by day, go back and check that out in your feed for Wednesday's show, episode 58.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   And the reason I had to go back--by the way, I don't mind missing a show.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   The reason I needed to go back and put that in was because I had 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   and I had pre-recorded the intros for the interviews for this next week.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   And if I did that, basically I would have a missing show or everything would be wrong.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   I just decided I didn't want to have a missing show from the numbers.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   So going on, today I am going to accomplish basically three things.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   I'm going to, number one, give you just a quick update on what you can expect for the next two weeks.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   I'll do it very quickly.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   Number two, I'm going to give two corrections that I have--some stuff I got wrong over the last couple weeks,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   and I want to correct both of those things because one of them is very important, one of them is important.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   And then number three, I'm going to give you what I think is a really great exercise this weekend,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   and I want to give it to you on a Friday show so you'll have time to do this exercise.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   And I think it would be--it's an excellent place to start or even to continue as you're working on your personal financial plans.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Thank you.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   Today is usually--Fridays are usually a Q&A show.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Thank you for those of you who have left some voicemails for me.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   I have received so far as of today, September 12th, as I'm recording this and as this show will go out,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   I've received a total of three voicemails, which is really cool.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   These three voicemails, two of them are questions, excellent questions,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   and one of them is just a thank you and a testimonial, and I just so appreciate that.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   It warmed my heart to hear, and I thank you.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   The questions were excellent.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   I had planned to cover one of them today but just crunched on time,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   and I can't give it justice and record the other things that I need to record today.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   So--but I thank you for those.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Those will be on a future show.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   If you haven't called in a question yet, please do so.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   Just go by the website, and you'll see the "Send Voicemail" button.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   You can do it on your computer, you can do it on your smartphone,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   and you'll be able just to send in a voicemail.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   And feel free to call in a question or a comment.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   Either one would be fine.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   I would be happy to have them.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   The questions have been excellent, and I think it's going to be a great way to bring more of the audience into the show
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   so you can hear some of the great questions,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   and also will be a great way for me to get an idea of the things that are of interest to you as an audience.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   Right now, so far, I'm kind of going based upon what's interesting to me,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   but I like to hear the things that are of interest to you.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   So thank you to you guys.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   Over the next two weeks, I am leaving Monday morning for New Orleans.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   I will be out there for a week at the FinCon conference,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   which is formerly the Financial Bloggers Conference.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   It's basically a giant meetup of people involved in the financial blogging, financial media,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   and financial advice, I don't know, the financial world.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   And I'm really excited about it, because I've never really met any financial bloggers,
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   except one or two that I've met offline,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   and then others that I met at the Podcast Movement Conference.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   So I'm looking forward to meeting a bunch of financial people
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   and hearing about this new industry that I've gotten myself into.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   I'm interested in learning a lot about it, so that will be fun.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   And then the following week, I will be up in Pennsylvania for a week of classes,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   fulfilling a residency requirement for my MSFS degree from the American College.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   MSFS is Masters in Financial Planning.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   FS is Masters of Science in Financial Services from the American College,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   which is a university of financial planning up there near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   So I'll be up there for a week of classes, looking forward to that,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   but I won't have much time to record shows while up there.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   Over the next three weeks, I have two interviews recorded and scheduled
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   for next week on Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   One is an interview with Eric Hemingway on his experience.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   He hosts the Family Adventure Podcast,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   and he and his wife and six kids spent three and a half years traveling the world.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   And really an interesting story, and we talk about how his financial planning
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   allowed him to do that on a sailboat and how much he spent.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   You definitely will enjoy that.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   On Thursday, I will be releasing an interview with Jeremy and Winnie from Go Curry Cracker.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   They write an excellent blog, and are early retirees, retired in their early 30s,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   and now consider themselves perpetual travelers.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   And they're doing some excellent work with the more technical side of tax planning.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   So that will be out on Thursday.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   Next week, I do not have time to prepare the shows, the lengthy shows that I have.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   I have a series of short essays, kind of just a few-minute essays that I'll be releasing.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   Hope you enjoy those.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   While at FinCon, I may be able to record a show or two.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   I plan to, but no commitments there.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   And if I can do that, I will release those as well.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   And then hopefully we'll have some essays lined up that I hope you'll enjoy.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   And then also, there may be a day or two without shows, and I will be back,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   basically the first week in October, ready to go, with back to the normal schedule,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   and hopefully some of this traveling behind me.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   Let's get to the corrections.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   The two corrections that I need to cover.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   The first one came in on episode 55, which was the episode--which was a listener question.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   The listener was named John.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   And he said, "Joshua, I have a million bucks in assets.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   I'm 35, and I hate my job. Can I retire early?"
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   And I gave through my answers of yes and no, depending on how you do it,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   and laid out the six different financial plans that I made up that would allow him to retire right now,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   depending on how he did it.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   In that podcast, I was making an illustration when talking about the IRS rule of 72(t) rules,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   which are about the series of substantially equal payments,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   which allows you to avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty on distributions from retirement accounts.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   And I used an example of a 55-year-old who is retiring early and taking money out of their 401(k).
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   And in the example, I said that this person at 55 years old,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   if making distributions from a 401(k) at early retirement,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   it would be troublesome because they would have to have those last for at least five years
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   or until 59 and a half, whichever is later.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   That's what the 72(t) rules cover.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   Kevin corrected me on the blog, and Kevin, thank you for doing that.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   He said that, "I've researched this since I'm a 55-year-old,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   and I found that if you're 55 or older and leave your employment,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   you have access to the entire 401(k) without penalty.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   I thought this could be helpful information."
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Kevin, it is. Thank you.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   I just screwed up. I forgot about that rule,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   and that's what I get for making up examples on the top of my head
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   and then forgetting about the little wrinkles.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   There is a rule on 401(k) plans.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   If you terminate your employment early, so terminate prior to the age of 59 and a half,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   as early as 55, you can distribute the amounts from the account
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   without having to pay the 10% penalty tax.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   That is a very important rule for you to know.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   I just blanked on it. I apologize for doing that,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   and I thank you for pointing it out to me.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   Here are a couple of details on how and why that might be important for you to consider.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   If you are an early retiree and you're working at a job and you have a 401(k),
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   if you're someone, which it sounds like Kevin is,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   if you're just looking at early retirement,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   you would want to make sure that you know that
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   so you know you don't have to keep working until 59 and a half
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   to take money out of your 401(k).
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Also, you would want to make sure you know that
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   so you don't take your money and roll it into an IRA.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   And that's the big gotcha here.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   Generally, if you talk with most financial planners,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   most of us will tell you for various reasons, which I won't go over today,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   we tell you if you leave your job, take your 401(k) with you and roll it into an IRA.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   There are exceptions to that rule, and this would be one of those exceptions.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   If in this situation, if Kevin, if you were to leave your 401(k)
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   and if you were to roll that account into an IRA
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   and then you were to try to take advantage of that rule, the rule is now gone
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   because that does not apply to your IRA.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   That only applies to 401(k) plans.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   So you would want to make sure that either you left all of your assets in the 401(k)
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   and took your distributions from that 401(k)
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   or that you only rolled over assets into your IRA
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   that you did not anticipate using prior to age 59 1/2.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   So if you take advantage of that rule, if you're 55 and older,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   that will allow you to be a little bit smarter and not--
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   it will allow you to avoid having to go through the 72(t)
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   and the Roth conversion strategies and those other--
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   the strategies to get the money out early.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   This also could be important for other early retiree planning
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   because that basically--and I'm just going off the top of my head here,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   but I'm pretty confident in this.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   If you were planning out your early retirement strategy,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   I should tell Brandon, Mad Scientist, and Jeremy, Go Curry Cracker,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   who are both really interested in this technical side about this.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   If one of you is friends with Brandon, I'll shoot him a note
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   and let him know that he might be interested in this.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   But this is one rule that he should bring into his scenarios--
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Brandon, the Mad Scientist--what he should bring into his scenarios
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   that he models on early retirement is that if you had a 401(k),
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   you could theoretically, I think, maintain this,
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   and if you're terminated from service at an early age
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   and you keep the money in the 401(k),
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   then that will allow you to cover that age 55 to age 60 gap out of that 401(k),
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   so then you wouldn't have to do the Roth conversion for that amount of the money.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   He ought to factor that in because he is really good
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   at focusing on all these little rules.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   I've got to make sure he knows about that one.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   I had forgotten about it.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   So, Kevin, thank you for correcting me.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   I would encourage others of you, if you ever find a mistake in what I say,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   please correct me.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Come by the blog.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   If you think I'm just wrong, come by and tell me.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   I'll enjoy hearing your side of the story, and I may change my mind.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   I have done that over many things over time.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   And two, if you find I'm factually wrong,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   not just because you think I'm wrong,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   I would appreciate knowing.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   I'm one guy doing this show with the minimum amount of time
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   that I--just giving it as much as I can,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   but I don't have as much--I'm not able to make as much time
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   as I would like to be able to prep everything, fact-check everything.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   I don't have a team of fact-checkers.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   It's me just doing it.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   So I am sure that I will get stuff wrong even more in the future,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   and I would appreciate your helping me to get things right.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   So if you find something, I'm relying on you
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   to do some crowd-sourced fact-checking
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   because I guarantee there are some of you in the audience
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   who are way better at this than I am,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   and all of you will have expertise in some subject that I don't,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   so I'm relying on you for crowd-sourced fact-checking.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   And I promise I will always--either in the show notes or on the show--
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   I will always acknowledge when I get stuff wrong
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   and try to correct it and make it right.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   That's very important to me to do, and I will work hard to do that.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   The second thing that I got wrong was actually on yesterday's show,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   was an interview with Ryan Finley from re-craigslist.com.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   And Ryan writes an awesome blog, really enjoyed the interview.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   During that interview, we were talking about
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   the ability of young people at a very early age,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   and I personally wonder a lot of times--I'm not going to say I'm sure--
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   I just wonder if we don't hamstring young people at an early age,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   and by just more than we should,
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   by kind of covering up their ability a lot of times.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   And this is a subject I'm interested in.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   I'll share some more thoughts in future shows.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   But for today, I just want to acknowledge two things.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   Number one is I gave two examples in our conversation.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   One was talking about Admiral Farragut,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   and I was talking about the early age at which he became a captain of a ship.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   And during the conversation, I wasn't able to remember the admiral's name.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   I went and looked it up later,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   and I read some info from his Wikipedia entry,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   and I feel like I may have misrepresented his story
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   because it's amazing enough without me representing it.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   I think he was the youngest admiral in U.S. Navy history,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   but he was not made the youngest admiral at the age of 12.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   He did indeed have his first command at the age of 12,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   and that was when he was put aboard a ship,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   which was a prize that they had defeated the ship,
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   and then he was put aboard with a skeleton crew,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   and he was made the temporary captain of that ship with a skeleton crew
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   at the age of 12 years old to sail it into harbor.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   Then he went on and continued to serve,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   and he grew through other commands as he grew older,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   and then he did become the youngest admiral in U.S. Navy history.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   Admiral Farragut, fascinating story to read more about him.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   But I felt like I misrepresented it in the comments,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   even my own correction after the show.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   The second thing that I got wrong, and I didn't think of it at the time,
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   and later after I released the show, it just was nagging my mind,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   and I went back and checked out some details,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   and I want to correct some details I got wrong about Benjamin Franklin's story.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   I believe I said in that interview that Benjamin Franklin started publishing his almanac
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   at the age in his early teens.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   I was wrong about that.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   He did not start publishing his almanac until the age of 26.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   And again, I want to make sure I get this right
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   because the true story is impressive enough without me getting details wrong.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   He didn't start publishing poor Richard's almanac until age 26,
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   and poor Richard's almanac was what indeed won him great fame and notoriety.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   And his story, however, before age 26, of what he had done before 26,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   was amazing enough.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   And when you look at his educational background, that was amazing enough.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   The one key thing that most impresses me about Benjamin Franklin's life
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   that I want to read is I want to read how he educated himself.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   And Benjamin Franklin was truly an amazing person,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   and he was financially independent at the age of 43.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   At the age of 43, he retired.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   So remember, this is in an era where he started off
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   as the youngest son of a hardworking tradesperson with 13 children,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   and he started with nothing.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   And he was a self-made man in early colonial America,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   and at the age of 43, he was financially independent.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   And there are a lot of lessons that we can learn from him
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   and from his experiences in achieving that financial independence.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   I'm re-inspired to go back and re-read his autobiography.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   I think I skimmed it a few years ago, but I didn't find it very interesting
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   just because the language is very old-fashioned.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   But I've added it to my reading list.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   I'm going to go back and try to re-read his autobiography that he wrote
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   and try to pull out some of the lessons from it
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   that we can apply to financial planning.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Because notice when he retired, that was when he went on to scientific pursuits.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   He didn't just sit around and do the equivalent of whatever watching TV was in his day.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   And he achieved early retirement in an age where he didn't have the 4% rule to do it.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   So how did he do it?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   Well, we'll talk about that another time.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   I want to read to you two pages that I find fascinating, which goes over--
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   the two pages are discussing how he educated himself.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   And to me, this is amazing, because this is what I was talking about
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   when he was in his early teens.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   This is what he was doing when he was in his late--
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   what would those be, single digits, tens?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   No, tens would be teens.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   When he was, I don't know, about ten and older,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   this is how he was educating himself.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   These two pages are coming from a book entitled
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   An Underground History of American Education
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   by an author named John Taylor Gatto.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   I have referenced this book a couple times on the show.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   Of all of the books that I have read on school and education,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   this is the one that most challenged--
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   that I find most challenging to basically everything I've ever thought
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   and learned about school and education.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   And this is a subject of great interest to me,
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   for those of you to whom it's also interesting.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   I would recommend that you read this book.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   He published it for free on his website online.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   So check it out.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   You can just Google "Underground History."
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   You'll find his website, and I will try to remember
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   to include a link in the show notes.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Additionally, if you don't like the page-by-page format
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   that he has on his site, you can easily find a PDF online.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   And if I can, I'll link to one of those in the show notes as well,
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   where you can read it in its entirety.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   This book will challenge you with how much you know
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   about the system of schooling that you live in.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   I'll just ask you one question, and I won't answer it,
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   because it's a question I think we all should be asked
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   and that I'm answering for myself.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   How much do you know about where the school system that you live in--
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   that we all live in--came from?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   And don't answer too quickly, and do some research before,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   because I certainly have been challenged by some of the things that I have read.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   But these two pages are really interesting,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   because they lay out how Franklin educated himself,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   and I think it's utterly fascinating.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   There are some comments from the author, Gatto,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   and then there are some quotes from Benjamin Franklin's autobiography.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   So when I mention, as I read this, "quote, end quote,"
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   those are the quotes from Benjamin Franklin's writing himself.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   "As it is for most members of a literate society,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   reading was the largest single element of Franklin's educational foundation.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   Quote, 'From a child I was fond of reading,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   Pleased with Pilgrim's progress,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   I afterwards sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's historical collections.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   They were small Chapman's books and cheap, 40 to 50 in all.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity,
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   most of which I read.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   Plutarch's Lives there was, in which I read abundantly,
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   and I still think that time spent to great advantage.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   There was also a book of Defoe's, called An Essay on Projects,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   and another of Dr. Mather's, called Essays to Do Good,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   that had an influence on some of the principal future events in my life.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   You might well ask how young Franklin was reading Bunyan, Burton, Mather,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   Defoe, Plutarch, and works of polemic divinity
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   before he would have been in junior high school.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   If you were schooled in the brain development lore of academic pedagogy,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   it might seem quite a tour de force.'
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   I should have clarified before starting to read that, yes, this was when he was--
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   I think I did clarify--
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   when he was 10, 11, 12 years old that he was reading those books.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   'How do you suppose this son of a working man, with 13 kids,
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   became such an effective public speaker
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   that for more than half a century his voice was heard nationally
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   and internationally on the great questions?
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   He employed a method absolutely free.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   He argued with his friend Collins,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   "Very fond we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   which disputatious turn is based upon contradiction."
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   Here Franklin warns against using dialectics on friendships
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   or at social gatherings.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   "I had caught it, the dialectical habit,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   by reading my father's books a dispute about religion.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   A question was started between Collins and me
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   and their abilities to study.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   He was of the opinion that it was improper.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   I took the contrary side."
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Shortly after he began arguing,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   he also began reading the most elegant periodical of the day,
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   Addison and Steele's Spectator.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   "I thought the writing excellent and wished, if possible, to imitate it.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   With that in view, I took some of the papers
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence,
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   laid them by a few days and then, without looking at the book,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   tried to complete the papers again,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   by expressing each hinted sentiment at length,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   and as fully as it had been expressed before,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   in any suitable words that should come to hand.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   Then I compared my spectator with the original,
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   discovered some of my faults, and corrected them."
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   This method was hammered out while working a 60-hour week.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   In learning eloquence, there's only Ben, his determination,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   and the spectator, no teacher.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   For instance, while executing rewrites,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   Franklin came to realize his vocabulary was too barren.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   "I found I wanted a stock of words,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   which I thought I should have acquired before that time
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   if I had gone on making verses,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   since the continual occasion for words of the same import
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   but of different length, to suit the measure,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   or of different sounds for the rhyme,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   would have laid me under a constant necessity
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   of searching for variety,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   and make me master of it."
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   As a good empiricist, he tried a home cure for this deficiency.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   "I took some tales and turned them into verse,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   and after a time when I had pretty well forgotten the prose,
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   turned them back again.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   I also sometimes jumbled my collection of hints," his outline,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   "into confusions, and after some weeks
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   endeavored to reduce them into the best order,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   which I began to form the full sentences and complete the paper.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   By comparing my work afterwards with the original,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   I discovered many faults and amended them.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   But I sometimes thought I had been lucky enough
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   to improve the method or the language."
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   By the time he was sixteen,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   Franklin was ready to take up his deficiencies in earnest,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   with full confidence he could, by his own efforts, overcome them.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Here's how he handled that problem with arithmetic.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   "Being on some occasion made ashamed of my ignorance in figures,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   which I had twice failed in learning when at school,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   I took Crocker's book of arithmetic
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   and went through the whole by myself with great ease.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   I also read Sellers and Shermy's book of navigation,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   and became acquainted with the geometry they contain."
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   This school dropout tells us he was also reading
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   John Locke's essay concerning human understanding,
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   as well as studying the arts of rhetoric and logic,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   particularly the Socratic method of disputation,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   which so charmed and intrigued him
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   that he abruptly dropped his former argumentative style,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   putting on the mask of the humble inquirer and doubter.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   I'll stop there.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   Ben Franklin had two years of schooling in his entire lifetime.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   He went to one year of grammar school,
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   and he went to another year at a less--
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   he got kicked out, somehow, I think he misbehaved,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   and he got kicked out,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   and he went to a year of writing and figuring school or something,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   which was evidently a little bit less prestigious
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   than grammar school was at that time.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   And it's fascinating,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   because in this section of the history of education,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   Gatto goes through the history of Franklin, George Washington,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   some of the founders of the country,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   many of the people who were well-known in the Revolutionary War,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   Farragut, and a couple of other examples
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   that aren't coming to mind right now.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   And he just goes through these examples,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   and he talks about how educated the average person was
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   compared to their schooling.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   Now, without getting off track into schooling today,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   just what impressed me about that,
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   and what I want you just to take away,
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   is that how he took control of his education,
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   and he modeled it.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   And he did that at a very early age.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   And that's what I found so impressive,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   is how clear he was at the age, in his early teens or before,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   recognizing his own problems and correcting them,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   recognizing that he didn't have an adequate vocabulary,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   and so practicing writing poetry
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   in order to enhance that vocabulary,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   and in studying new words.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   And he recognizing that he didn't have the skill
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   that he needed in mathematics,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   so going and buying a book of mathematics to learn.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   And simply recognizing and practicing his writing style
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   by comparing it to the best that he had available to him,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   and correcting that and learning.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   And I was so impressed by that,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   and also by the things that he did at an early age,
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   and how it seems as though we forget about the fact
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   that George Washington, at 12 years old,
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   is out surveying as a professional surveyor.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   Excuse me, not 12 years old, 17 years old.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   It's so hard to get these dates right, forgive me.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   I'm doing my best to be very accurate,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   but I need to make sure that I have my facts
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   very carefully lined up.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   Washington had no schooling until he was 11.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   Let me read one quick paragraph from,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   one more paragraph here from
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   an underground history of American education,
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   and you can see why I'm so impressed
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   with some of these stories.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   Washington had no schooling until he was 11.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   No classroom confinement, no blackboards.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   He arrived at school already knowing how to read,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   write, and calculate about as well as
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   the average college student today.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   If that sounds outlandish,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   turn back to Franklin's curriculum,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   and compare it with the intellectual diet
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   of a modern, gifted, and talented class.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Full literacy wasn't unusual in the colonies
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   or early republic.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   Many schools wouldn't admit students
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   who didn't know reading and counting,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   because few schoolmasters were willing
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   to waste time teaching what was so easy to learn.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   It was deemed a mark of depraved character
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   if literacy hadn't been attained
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   by the matriculating student.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   Even the many charity schools operated by churches,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   towns, and philanthropic associations for the poor
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   would have been flabbergasted at the great hue
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   and cry raised today about difficulties
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   teaching literacy.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   American experience proved the contrary.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   Following George to school at 11 to see
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   what the schoolmaster had in store
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   would reveal a skimpy menu of studies,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   yet one with a curious gravity.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Geometry, trigonometry, and surveying.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   You might regard that as impossible,
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   or consider it was only a dumbed-down version
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   of those things, some kids' game
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   akin to the many simulations one finds today
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   in schools for prosperous children.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   Simulated city building, simulated court trials,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   simulating businesses, virtual realities
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   to bridge the gap between adult society
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   and the immaturity of the young.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   But if George didn't get the real thing,
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   how do you account for his first job
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   as official surveyor for Culpeper County, Virginia,
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   only 2,000 days after he first hefted
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   a surveyor's transit in school?
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   For the next three years,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   Washington earned the equivalent
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   of about $100,000 a year
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   in today's purchasing power.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   It's probable his social connections
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   helped this fatherless boy get the position,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   but in frontier society, anyone would be crazy
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   to give a boy serious work
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   unless he actually could do it.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   Almost at once, he began speculating in land.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   He didn't need a futurist to tell him
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   which way the historical wind was blowing.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   By the age of 21, he had leveraged
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   his knowledge and income into 2,500 acres
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   of prime land in Frederick County, Virginia.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   So again, I don't want to get the facts incorrect
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   because the facts are impressive enough
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   without my mixing up a date or two.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   So I'm going to try to be very careful
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   in the future with some of those dates and ages.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   And I'm going to be very careful.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   And if you find me getting one wrong,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   please let me know.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   And I hope that you find those thoughts interesting.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Washington would also be one who would be interesting
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   for me to study and do a show on
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   what we could learn from his example.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   I love these historical examples
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   because what you find is that people
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   have been achieving their financial goals
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   since long before we ever had 401(k)s
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   and since we ever had disability income insurance.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   They've been applying the principles of finance
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   that go far beyond just the short-term tactics.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   And then once you understand the principles,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   then we can apply them in our own lives,
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   whether we're living in the United States,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   whether we're living in Canada,
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   whether we're living in Kenya,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   whether we're living in Brazil or Costa Rica
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   or you insert wherever you happen to live.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   We can apply those principles
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   beyond whatever our local scenario is.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   And then once we understand those principles,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   I think that'll help us to be less worried,
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   so to speak, about the changes that can occur.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   So we may be less worried about
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   when the monetary system is adjusted,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   whether we're dealing in pounds or euros
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   or whether Scotland separates from England
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   or whether the Federal Reserve continues their purchases
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   or doesn't continue their purchases
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   or whether we have access to a 401(k) at work or not
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   or whatever, you get the point.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   Yes, all those things matter and they are important,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   but we can work through them
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   because they will always be changing.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   They're changing now. They will always be changing.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   We need to look forward and see the changes
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   and then create plans that will work
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   no matter what those changes are.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   Now, let's wrap up with some questions
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   that I would like to share with you,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   and I hope you'll find these helpful.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   I really want to, in each show,
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   I'm not just doing a show every day
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   to fill up the air with my shows.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   I'm doing a show every day
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   because I want to provide useful opportunities
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   and useful thoughts for each and every day
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   that will help you on your journey towards wealth
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   and towards independence in every way.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   I want to share with you some questions,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   and these are actually, I want to give credit
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   to Dan Sullivan as the inventor of these questions.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Now, when I first heard these questions,
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   I didn't actually know that it was Dan Sullivan
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   who had invented them.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   I first heard these questions,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   especially the first one,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   when I was working as a financial planner.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   And most financial planners,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   or at least any good financial planners,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   will generally not start by talking about, with you,
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   if you were consulting with a financial planner,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   they won't start by talking with you about,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   "Okay, how much you got in your 401(k)?"
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   or "How much insurance do you have?"
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   That's not a good place to start for a good conversation.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   It's really not.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   So a good financial planner will never start there.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   And if a client wants to start there,
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   I'd usually avoid the conversation,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   because I've never had good experience
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   with clients who want to start there.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   No offense to those of you who would start there, I'm sure.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   But the thing is, most of the people who want to--
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   most of the people who sit down in a financial planner's office
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   and say, "What can you do for me?"
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   without sharing anything about their situation,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   it's either kind of a baiting game--
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   this is my experience, okay?
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   If your experience is different, that's fine.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   But my experience is either a baiting game,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   as far as, "Let me see if I can trap the financial planner
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   "in something that I can point out where they're just stupid
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   "and they don't understand what they're talking about,"
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   or it may be some kind of just comparison of services,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   as in, "I've already decided that I'm going to use Company X,
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   "but let me just check real quick
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   "and do some quick quotes from B, C, and D,"
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   and--or something like that.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   It's just I've never had any of those conversations go anywhere,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   so I always just used to end them.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   And if those of you--some of you use that tactic, that's fine.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Maybe you'll find people that are interested to work with you
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   in that way.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   I never found it effective for me.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   It doesn't work for my personality.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   I don't like to be compared, you know, by--
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   I don't mind being compared,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   but I don't like to be compared with someone else's spreadsheet
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   when I don't even know what the factors are
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   on the spreadsheet yet,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   and I would just rather avoid the whole scenario
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   and work with people that I like and that respect me
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   and that trust me.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   So hopefully that's not insulting to anybody.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   But--so a good--most good financial planners
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   will start with goals,
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   and a lot of times this gets kind of a bad rap
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   'cause people often hear this
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   and they kind of make fun of it and say,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   "Well, you know, what are your goals?
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   What are your goals?"
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   But hopefully you're starting to understand,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   and this shows by now,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   is that everything depends on your goals.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   So a good financial planner who's working as a consultant
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   and who's really listening to you has to start there,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   not with saying, "Let me compare the--you know,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   let me assess the fees on your mutual funds for you."
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   That has a place, and that's important,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   but it's not where to start.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   And so years ago, I found--
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   I was listening to a tape by somebody
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   with financial planning training,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   part of my automobile university while I was driving around,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   and I heard someone ask this question,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   and the question was--
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   as a kind of an opening question for a client,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   the question was,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   "If we were sitting down three years from today,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   what has to have happened for you
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   over the next three years
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   for you to really feel happy about your progress?"
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   And I just thought, "What a brilliant question."
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   Because the trouble when you're working
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   as a financial planner with clients
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   is you want to be specific and direct,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   but you don't want to be too specific
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   and too direct too quickly.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   You know, there's a little bit of a getting up
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   and kind of a getting-to-know-you time,
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   and there's a real art to it,
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   to be able to do it in a way that's comfortable for people
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   and is something that you just have to learn.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   But when I heard that question, I said,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   "That's a great question. I can use that."
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   And so I immediately started using it with clients
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   to good effect.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   And from then on,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   basically for every introductory financial planning meeting
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   that I ever did for the next--
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   it must have been three, four, five--I don't know,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   three or four years, something like that,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   I always started with that question.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   But I didn't know where it came from.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   And then I later found it on--
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   I was listening to a success CD,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   the success magazine.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   If you subscribe every month, they send you a success CD.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   And somewhere on a success CD, I heard that question.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   I said, "Oh, it came from someone else
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   other than the person I heard it from."
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   And then at some point, I was rereading a book
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   called "The Success Principles,"
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   which is written by Jack Canfield.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   And in that book, I found the same question.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Except when I found it in Jack Canfield's book,
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   it had three follow-up questions
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   that I found were super valuable.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   And so that's what I'm going to share with you today.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   And I hope you'll take these.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   I will write the questions out in the show notes,
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   and I hope you'll take these
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   and use them as a stimulus for your own thinking.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   So I thought they were well-written questions.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   In preparation--oh, by the way,
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   just real quick, since I mentioned
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   Jack Canfield's book, "The Success Principles,"
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   if you're looking for one book
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   that is probably the best book
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   that is the most comprehensive
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   and the most pithy,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   I would recommend to you a book
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   called "The Success Principles" by Jack Canfield.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   Of all of the "success literature"
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   that I've ever read,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   it's really comprehensive,
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   really well-written,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   and just an excellent resource.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   So I would commend it to you as worth your time
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   if you're looking for one book.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   It's the type of book where it's great to read
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   one chapter a day.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   They're very short chapters, very comprehensive.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   Every one is very useful.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   And then there are many other books
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   that you can follow up for more detailed information.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   But even just in preparing real quick
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   to see if I could find something for this show
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   and to see if I could find something on Dan Sullivan's site
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   with a link to these questions,
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   I actually found he wrote a whole book on it.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   And it's called "The Dan Sullivan Question."
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   I didn't know about the book,
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   but I just found it a couple minutes ago.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   I've gone ahead and added it to my list here.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   You can find it on Amazon.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   It's called "The Dan Sullivan Question."
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   And I assume that this is what--
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   this specific question is what the whole book is about.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   But I need to verify that.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   But we're going to wrap up today with these questions.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   And what I want to do is I'm just going to read you the questions.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   There are four of them total.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   And then I will kind of stop,
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   and then I will read them again.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   And so that way, if you are interested in just hearing them again
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   and then pausing and then writing down your answers
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   or thinking about them--
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   a lot of times when I hear audio things,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   I'm usually driving in the car.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   So I'll read all four of them through quickly, one time.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   And then I will read them again, and I'll stop.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   And you can pause the audio in between.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   And you can just think about them as you're driving down the road
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   or doing whatever you're doing.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   And that can be helpful.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   If you have time this weekend,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   it might be a good journaling exercise
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   to journal your answers to the questions.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   And after I read the questions the second time,
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   I won't--don't worry about me putting anything extra in there.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   So feel free just to--
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   I'm going to wrap up the show with that,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   and I won't put anything in after I read these questions again.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   But I like the questions for many reasons,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   and I'm not going to spend any more time talking about them.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   I'm just going to tell you that they are probably the best written questions
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   that I've ever found that are good for framing an overall view.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   And I think they're an excellent topic to have in your journaling notebook
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   of thought starters to make sure that you're working towards
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   the things that are important to you.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   Question number one.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   If we were meeting three years from today,
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   what has to have happened during that three-year period
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   for you to feel happy about your progress?
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   Question number two.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   What are the biggest dangers you'll have to face and deal with
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   in order to achieve that progress?
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   Question number three.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   What are the biggest opportunities that you have
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   that you would need to focus on and capture to achieve those things?
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   Number four.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   What strengths will you need to reinforce and maximize,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   and what skills and resources will you need to develop
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   that you don't currently have in order to capture those opportunities?
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   And those are the four questions.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   I recommend them to you as a worthy subject of thought,
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   as a journaling exercise, so that you can help yourself to coach yourself
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   and understand what you're trying to work toward,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   what your opportunities are.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   I hope that they are valuable to you.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   They've been very valuable to me, both professionally and personally.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   I'm going to read them again.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   I will pause in between them.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   Feel free to pause your phone or MP3 player or whatever
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   in between these questions if you're driving down the road
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   and you'd like to just think about it.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   And there won't be anything after that.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   So number one.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   If we were meeting three years from today,
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   what has to have happened during that three-year period
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   for you to feel happy about your progress?
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   Number two.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   What are the biggest dangers you'll have to face and deal with
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   in order to achieve that progress?
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Number three.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   What are the biggest opportunities that you have
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   that you would need to focus on and capture to achieve those things?
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   Number four.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   What strengths will you need to reinforce and maximize?
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   And what skills and resources will you need to develop
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   that you don't currently have in order to capture those opportunities?
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Thank you for listening.
