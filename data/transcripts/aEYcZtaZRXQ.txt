[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Alright, everybody, welcome back to the number one podcast in the world. It's episode 185. And
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.880]   you're going to be delighted by today's docket. If you're into politics, we move the taping back a
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   day gentlemen, because we knew there would be a presidential debate. So with me to discuss all
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.200]   things presidential debate and the news finance markets, maybe even a little science from our
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.480]   science boy, David Freeberg is the rain man, David Sachs. Yeah, true. I have a t is frozen.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360]   Or he's staring everybody down. How are you, sir?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840]   We're about to enter the endgame. Jason.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.120]   Oh, the endgame is here. Okay, we're in the endgame now.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.480]   And from a we work in the home office in Pasadena is our friend, the Sultan of science. He's back
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.000]   to work. He's in his cube. Did you get the TPS reports done? How you doing there? The humble
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   headquarters of Oh, hollow genetics, beautiful lab downstairs. I'll take you on a tour one day.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   Can't wait to hear my friends gloat and bloat themselves on the show today. After the debate
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.840]   last night. It's going to be insufferable. I'm looking forward to it. Okay, so you're building
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.560]   the next $10 billion company and we don't get to invest but we do get a tour. Thank you. Good to
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.600]   know. We're better. We brought this every week. We can you guys want to put money and I will open
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.000]   up the round again for you. And you guys you said this three times when do we wet our beaks?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.480]   Jekyll's right about this. Actually, that's how you know the winner. The one he doesn't let us
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.160]   invest in is the winner. It's the easiest way to his portfolio. He's like, Hey, can I can I
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:56.080]   introduce you to a soda pop machine? Rain Man David. All right, everybody, let's get to the
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.480]   show here enough of the craziness last night was the first presidential debate and there's no easy
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.520]   way to put this. It was an unmitigated disaster for the Democrats and President Biden. Gosh,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.120]   he looked confused. Lots of slips, lots of gaffes. If you are under a rock, living in a cave without
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680]   Starlink and you missed it. Here's a couple clips. Everybody's talking about this one
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   where Biden lost his train of thought for close to 10 seconds, but
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.080]   to do with the with the covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   Look, if we finally beat Medicare, thank you, President Biden, President Trump.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.840]   Gosh, that was brutal. And the reaction from CNN, even MSNBC's Joy Reid, as far left as you can go,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.080]   was brutal and candid. And here it is. The knives are out from the Democrats for President Biden.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.600]   Right now, as we speak, there is a deep, a wide and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.360]   Party. It started minutes into the debate and it continues right now. It involves party strategists.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.760]   It involves elected officials. It involves fundraisers. And they are having conversations
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   about the president's performance, which they think was dismal, which they think will hurt
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.360]   other people down the party in the ticket. And they're having conversations about what they
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.200]   should do about it. Some of those conversations include, should we go to the White House and ask
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.480]   the president to step aside? Other of the conversations are about should prominent
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.600]   Democrats go public with that call because they feel this debate was so terrible?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.400]   That was painful. I love Joe Biden. I work for Joe Biden. He did not do well at all.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.520]   And I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120]   different course now. There is time for this party to figure out a different way forward,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.720]   if he will allow us to do that. I too was on the phone throughout much of the debate. My phone
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.240]   really never stopped buzzing throughout. And the universal reaction was somewhere approaching
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.280]   panic. The people who were texting with me were very concerned about President Biden seeming
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak. This has been, quite frankly, a car accident
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   in slow motion that we've seen over and in building and questioning it. And as has been
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.680]   pointed out, Joe Biden sought this debate at this remarkably early time because he knew he was
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.800]   losing and he needed to change the narrative. And he did change the narrative. He sunk his
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.880]   campaign tonight. All right, gentlemen, there is absolutely no way any of us could have predicted
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.320]   this. Oh, wait, Nick, read the room, Democrats. You have put up a candidate that nobody wants.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.760]   His policies on the border and some other issues are not in sync with the majority of the country.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.920]   At some point, the Democrats just have to take a deep look in the mirror and say we fielded a bad
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.840]   candidate who's too old and people don't believe will stand up to scrutiny of like, say, being on
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.880]   the all in pot for two hours, or in the debates, or with a hostile interview or any of those
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.960]   possibilities. And so, I think if that's the case, we really need to have the Democrats think
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.840]   deeply about maybe fielding a different candidate. And I believe that's what's going to happen in the
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.040]   next 30 to 60 days. So, I'm predicting... You think there's going to be a switcheroo?
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.960]   100%. I mean, if you just look at the polls, it's 100% there'll be a switcheroo.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.160]   Who's the switcheroo? I have no idea. It could be Gavin. It could be anybody.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.560]   Anything's possible. I think Trump's going to demolish him in the debate. I think he'll sink
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.840]   to 30% in the polls. And then the Democrats will find a way to give him a graceful out,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200]   and then they'll field somebody else. I think the Democrats, as cynical as it sounds,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.360]   we're waiting to see what happens with this Trump trials conviction, what you call lawfare,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.720]   what other people call fair use of the law. And then they are going to see how he does in the
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.280]   debates. That's why they moved the debate up in June. And I think they know to pull the plug on
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.320]   this if it gets too far gone. And they have the ability to do that because all he's got to say is,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   "You know what? I'm feeling old, and I want us to win, and I'm going to slot somebody else in."
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.320]   All right. And to wrap this up, prediction markets showing
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:22.640]   Biden has plummeted to, let's check the number, oh, yeah, 33% in the sharps, as you've referred
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   to them on the program, are basically saying Biden's going to drop out now, 44% chance over
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.800]   on poly market will Biden drop out of the presidential race, and then predicted another
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.160]   one of these prediction markets where you can actually bet real dollars. It's not a plug for
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.840]   them or commercial, just those happen to be two of the bigger ones. Newsom sits at 14% now, Biden,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:54.160]   33%, Trump at 58%. At the start of the evening before the debate, Biden was at 47%. Post-debate
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   Chamath, we see Biden dropping 47% to 33%. There's nothing like this has happened in modern politics.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   Your thoughts, Chamath Palihapitiya, and then Saxe will give you the red meat.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.960]   Let me just start by saying that President Biden is a person that's given up his whole life
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.320]   to work on behalf of America in the best way that he thought was possible.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.920]   He's overcome a lot of tragedies. I think he's worked very hard. He's diligently tried to do
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.440]   what he thought was right on behalf of the people of Delaware and then the United States.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:40.080]   My honest takeaway is that that person though is no longer really in charge. And I think that that
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.680]   was very troubling for me. And it actually makes the last sort of six months make a lot more sense.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.000]   So I thought the fact that we could not get a response from the White House to be, I took it
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.160]   a little bit actually personally. I was wondering why for someone that had been such an ardent
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   supporter, I couldn't even get an email back when I was consistently asking them to be on the pod.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.680]   And now I see that it wasn't just one single act. It was part of a holistic strategy. It was the
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.720]   same strategy that boxed RFK out of the Democratic primary. Because could you imagine if this event
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.560]   had happened when he had to debate RFK in the Democratic primaries, it would have been exposed
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:30.800]   then. It's probably partly to explain how the law has been used in New York State, whether you want
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.760]   to call it lawfare or not, but it was a very directed partisan action. And so all of these
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.720]   things are now three data points that are really important. You will not come on an open format show
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.480]   like ours to just speak openly. None of us were going to attack him or try to corner him or box
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   him in. You prevented other people from actually challenging you and directly asking questions of
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.560]   you in the Democratic primaries. And then you try to put political pressure on your opponents.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.960]   All of that is systematically about a group of people that are unelected,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.640]   who are trying to control democracy. And I think that that's the most troubling takeaway from this.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   I don't think that you should take away from last night that Joe Biden had a bad debate.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.400]   I think what we should take away is that there is a person who should be allowed
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.440]   to transition into the sunset and be celebrated for what he's done. And instead, there are people
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:34.720]   that, frankly, at the margins are acting pretty unethically and at the limit is actually acting
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.080]   somewhat diabolically to prop this person up so that they can keep power. For example, you've been
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.680]   in situations where you would expect the team that runs a company to be able to stand up and say the
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.400]   CEO is not in a position to run this company anymore. That's what you would expect if there's
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.680]   good governance and honesty. You know, what was Ron Klain doing as an example when he was doing
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.360]   debate prep? Did he legitimately believe that Joe Biden was prepared for this or mentally capable
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.040]   of actually doing this? And the fact that they are allowing his legacy to be destroyed after 50
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.160]   years, I think, is really tragic. Yeah. Well said, by the way,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.480]   come off sex, your thoughts on what we witnessed last night and the reaction to it.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:24.400]   Well, let me speak as a objective and independent political observer,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.680]   OK, just as independent as you, Jake. Yes, let's do that. Let's be independent today. Yeah,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.960]   look, anyone can have a bad night. Certainly.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:40.320]   His campaign put out the word that he had a cold and maybe he just had a bad night. I mean,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:47.920]   after all, it was media people like Joe Scarborough just saying a week ago that not only was Biden
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   cognitively fine, but in fact, he was the best Joe Biden he had ever seen just a week ago or two
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.240]   weeks ago. Reid Hoffman was saying that he had a two hour lunch with Joe Biden and Biden was
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.360]   regaling him with details of AI and Gaza and he was good. And so we've heard from all these highly
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   reputable people is that Biden may not present that well in public, but in private, he's just
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.760]   fine. You're saying they're lying and they lied to the American people. Well, I'm actually taking
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.080]   them at their word because they seem like very trustworthy sources to me. I see no reason
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.240]   to swap out this candidate. I think that anyone can have a bad night and there's no reason
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.680]   and there's no reason whatsoever for the media to be panicking like this.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.040]   Satire socks, satire socks is into the chat. Satire socks is into the chat.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.080]   Well, I mean, look, I just I think that there's no reason for this kind of panic.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:52.000]   I believe in democracy and the Democratic primary voters have spoken. This is the
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.320]   candidate who they voted for. OK, and there is there is your message. Stand by your man. Stop
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.880]   being a wimp just because your candidate had one bad night. You don't stab him in the back like
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.160]   absolutely not. And I think Van Jones said that Republicans wouldn't do this if Trump had a bad
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.520]   night. You know, he's like, why? Why are we all stabbing Biden in the back? So look, this is a
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.440]   candidate who you've been supporting for years. This is a candidate who you rigged the primaries
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.960]   for. You boxed out Bobby Kennedy, who, you know, I thought was a fantastic candidate.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.520]   You basically boxed out Dean Phillips. This is the candidate you wanted just days ago. You were
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.760]   saying was completely mentally fit. In fact, the best he'd ever been. OK, so you made your bed
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.920]   sleeping. You made your bed sleeping. Stop betraying your candidate like this. It's unseemly.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.760]   Satire sacks some loyalty, for God's sake. OK, you heard from compassionate Chamath.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.480]   You got to hear from satire sacks. Now let's go to morning Friedberg. What do you got this morning?
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:07.680]   Frank Friedberg. Frank Friedberg. Talk to it, buddy. Go for it. The big loser of last night's
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.880]   debate was the American public. The big winner of last night's debate was probably Russia,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.840]   China, Iran, maybe the Saudis licking their chops, watching the utter dysfunction in the
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.000]   leadership of the party, in the leadership of the country as it stands today. A notable mention,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.080]   I will say, was the debate format. I absolutely love the fact that there were no interruptions,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   that the mics went mute, that there was no audience and the moderators didn't kind of
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.920]   challenge back and forth and try and make themselves the show. That was very unique
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.600]   and in a presidential debate. So I actually like the debate format. They stopped interrupting me.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:52.000]   Hmm. Thanks for the interruption. I think that, as Saks points out, the biggest issue is that this
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.920]   was front and center. Biden's decline in capacity and aptitude for quite some time. I didn't tell
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.400]   you guys this before, but last October. A senior member of the Democratic Party reached out to me
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.480]   for a, quote, meeting. I took the meeting in October. And of course, it turns out they were
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.720]   asking me for money. Little did they know, I don't give any money to politics ever. I never have,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   never will. So they're, they're handlers are morons for bringing this person in to come and
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.160]   talk to me. In the meeting, I said, you cannot put Joe Biden forward as your candidate. What the hell
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.480]   are you guys thinking? He's like, no, he is completely stable. He is as sharp as he's ever
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   been. I sent him an email, and I'm going to read you what I said to him. This was in the first,
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.720]   second week of October. I said, Joe Biden does not appear equipped to be president of the United
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.160]   States. I think the continued heralding of Democratic Party leadership of the president's
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.680]   performance and ability to continue to serve into the next term is mind boggling. His inability to
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.320]   conduct even a basic interview or give a clear and concise statement in a candid setting highlights a
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.720]   clear and obvious decline in function since he took office. It is important for Democratic leadership
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.280]   to find an alternative candidate and message this soon. Doing so I believe will buoy fundraising
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.120]   efforts across yada, yada, yada. I said I would feel uncomfortable with the Democratic majority
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.560]   Senate head in house giving a leader with declining aptitude nearly limitless effect.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.840]   So I sent this as my response to his follow up request for money. This was the second week of
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.960]   October. And I wanted to pull up the date on this because it was so apparent back then what was
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:32.880]   going on. So what's so striking is how long mainstream media and leadership in the Democratic
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.320]   Party have tried to tell an alternative story that was so obviously revealed to be not true
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.440]   last night. And that is the thing that I think makes me say America is losing because there are
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.840]   a few people that are in charge of controlling the narrative. There are a few people in charge
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.640]   who decide who gets to be the candidate. And those few people are keeping democracy
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.160]   from working effectively, because the raw data, the direct data, imagery, the video,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   the media content that has come out of Biden over quite some period of time made it so obvious that
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   he was not in full capacity. And so that was my biggest kind of takeaway is that there's something
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.480]   wrong with the way things are running in this country. You're saying that the media, you're
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.600]   saying the media and the Democratic Party leadership are lying to America. Yeah. And I
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   think because if you of course, the fact that we all had this information, we've seen the videos,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.400]   we've seen the interviews. And every time a video or an interview comes out, it has been excused
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.320]   away as, oh, well, he tripped or, oh, you know, it wasn't well edited. And every time there's a
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:41.040]   story and then when it's fully exposed, it becomes like, well, my God, the fact that they all flipped
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.680]   so quickly is what's so shocking because this was there. And, you know, if you're on Twitter,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.280]   you can see these clips being talked about by millions of people. But then media and democratic
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.240]   leadership won't acknowledge that the subversion of democracy is really the real threat to democracy.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.680]   To your point, you have the right to elect a person up or down. None of us are choosing to
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.440]   elect a shadow cabinet of handlers to run America. That's not what any of us are signing up for. And
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.320]   I think that's what we have the risk of having for another four years. If this lie isn't exposed.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   What I what I find unbelievably shocking is all of these data points now just makes so much sense
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.160]   because the through line is, as you said, a coordinated effort to kind of obfuscate his
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.920]   decline. Like if you thought about this in a different way, if you took a twenty nine year
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.600]   old and a thirty two year old, would you say that they're the same? Absolutely right. If you took a
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.320]   thirty nine and a forty two year old, they're the same. A forty nine and a fifty two year old,
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   they're the same. But the reality is a seventy nine and an eighty two year old or a seventy eight
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.760]   and an eighty two year old are meaningfully different. And the reason is that because
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.400]   there is significant decline every year, every month, every day. And you're seeing the impact
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.080]   of every week, day and month and year as a president of the United States, where on an
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   eighty two year old body. And I'm not sure any of us would do much better. But the reality is that
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.880]   when you're at that age, there's a level of transparency that's required and we have the
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.000]   opposite. So take Warren Buffett as the counterfactual to this. Warren Buffett is in his
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.160]   early 90s. But what does he do every year? He marches tens of thousands of people into Omaha.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:34.720]   He sits them down. He sits at the front of a dais with Coca-Cola and peanut brittle and speaks for
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.200]   six to eight hours and is sharp as a tack. Well, the point is, if you decide after those six to
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.760]   eight hours of fully transparent, unedited interaction with Warren Buffett that you
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.320]   don't think he's capable of leading Berkshire, you can sell the stock. What they don't do
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.880]   is hide him behind the shadows, propping him out and package interviews and all of this other stuff
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.040]   that is un-American and undemocratic. And you see why, because the importance,
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.800]   as Friedberg said, is so high. You probably do have a lot of people outside the United States
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.720]   really questioning what is going on in the greatest country in the world right now,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.040]   that this can even happen. And the people that you thought were so anti-Trump,
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.240]   right, that they would do anything to make sure that Donald Trump was unelected.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   Well, they're actually not that anti-Trump. They're just pro-power, because the thing that
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.000]   they care more about than their hatred of Donald Trump is their desire to stay in power.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.560]   Yeah, I think these are all very well said, Frank Friedberg. Nicely done. I mean,
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.440]   how is anyone at this point in time surprised? Like, we have been talking about his cognitive
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.320]   ability for a couple of years here on this podcast. Everybody's been talking about it on
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.840]   Twitter. They've been talking about it on social media. Everybody's been talking about it at every
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.800]   Christmas, every Thanksgiving for a couple of years right now. And, you know, this long form
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.920]   discussion podcast test is the ultimate test. And I think people need to take that to heart.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.640]   If you look at the long form podcast, and I'm just saying this to toot our own horn here,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.240]   it could be Joe Rogan, it could be Tim Ferriss, it could be whoever you want, Lex Friedman. When you
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.680]   saw RFK, Vivek, Trump, Chris Christie, Dean Phillips come on this podcast, talk for, in some
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   cases, two plus hours, it was clear they were there. And this is completely selfish on the part
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:29.200]   of Biden's family, the people around him to, you know, stay in power. And the hot swaps coming,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   I just I'm telling you right now, he is not going to be in this race in the next 30 days.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.320]   Well, the hot the hot swap is going to create a free for all Jason.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.240]   Which is better, better than running somebody who has a 30% chance of winning. And I'm going to take
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:48.800]   this a step further. This is 25th Amendment territory, this person is not fit to serve
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.760]   as president for the remaining of his term. What we saw last night was incredibly troubling.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.160]   He was not there. And I've been saying this till I'm blue in the face for months. This is
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.440]   absolutely disgusting that they did this. This is elder abuse. I don't say that as a joke.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.760]   I say this sincerely, I remember when my dad had to take the keys away from my grandfather,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.480]   God rest his soul. My grandfather wanted to drive that car, you know, the streets of Brooklyn, his
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.080]   station wagon. My dad at some point said this guy keeps clipping other people's mirrors. We got to
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.120]   take the car away. So you know what my dad did? He went to my grandfather, God rest his soul. And he
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.640]   said, Listen, the car was stolen. And I'm sitting there as a seven year old next to my dad. And I'm
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.200]   like, wasn't stolen. And my dad said, You know what the car was stolen, pop, we can't afford a
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   new car. I'll lend you my car once in a while. My dad then sold the car for 800 bucks and got out.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.160]   That's what we need to do. You got to take the keys away from Biden. He's not fit to finish the
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:54.720]   rest of his term. Period, full stop. And I'm glad everybody else now sees what, you know, half of us
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:05.360]   saw for the last year. Well, look, who you're gonna believe the J cows, uninformed, non expert
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:13.200]   opinion or the expert medical opinion of Dr. Joe Biden with her doctor in education? Well, I mean,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.040]   the bias is strong. When you see that clip. I mean, play the clip of Biden post. These guys
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.640]   are so deranged. These lunatics are so deranged. They thought they won last night. Here's a clip
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:33.040]   of Joe Biden. Telling Macbeth telling Biden he did good. Joe, you did such a great job. You
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:42.640]   answered every question. Let me ask the crowd. What did Trump do?
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:52.880]   You're not running. Joe Biden's not running. You're not running. This is a farce. And now
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.120]   the veil is so happy. He looks so happy in that moment getting that approval. I mean,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.320]   give the man some milk and cookies. I mean, he was literally let the man retire to your
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.280]   point Chamath. Compassionate Chamath said a great like the guy had a lifetime of service,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.240]   let the guy retire, let him spend time with his grandkids, great grandkids, whatever he's blessed
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   with. And let's, let's do the hot swap. Now. It's incredible that not a single staff member
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.920]   has resigned. Isn't that incredible? Like, where they see this, Jason, and they have the moral
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.520]   clarity to say, hold on a second, this is really wrong. Not a single one. Yeah, that is really
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.400]   scary. It's a really good point. And actually, I thought, I thought one of Trump's best moments
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:40.080]   in the debate, a line that I hadn't heard him say before, is that Joe, you never fired anyone,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.320]   you know, and he was specifically talking about the Afghanistan withdrawal. But just more
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.880]   generally, when have you ever fired anyone for getting anything wrong? Whereas I, Trump, fired
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.400]   Comey, I fired other people and I paid a political price for that. But at least I was willing to
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.360]   fire people who do a bad job. You're not. Well, now we know the reason for that is because the
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.640]   original Biden Biden is just the staff. So why would the staff ever fired themselves. And this
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.360]   is why it's actually important to have a leader at the top to have a commander in chief as opposed
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.280]   to just a shadow government consisting of party apparatchiks. And that's what we have is what the
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.960]   problem is, when the staff gets something wrong, there's no one there to fire them.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.040]   How like how does somebody who's worked for Biden for 40 or 50 years, who sat in Camp David helping
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   to do debate prep, at no point have the compassion to say, sir, this is not work, because that would
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.800]   be firing themselves, Chamath. No, no, I know. And it's a rhetorical question. I'm just saying,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.000]   there's a more sinister reason. And I think sector pointing it out there, which is they consider
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.200]   Trump such an existential threat, and they want to maintain power that they're willing to do anything
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.640]   to keep power, you know. And, you know, listen, I don't want to get into Trump here, but he's got
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.080]   his own ways to stay in power himself. This was an embarrassment for America, this debate,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.560]   the fact that these are the two candidates is a complete embarrassment.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   Well, I think the real embarrassment for the media was the fact that they were exposed.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.800]   The fact of the matter is, for months, if not years, they've been saying that this candidate
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.920]   is fine. He is cognitively fit. In fact, he's the best he's ever been. I've had two hour lunches
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.800]   with him. He's wonderful. That's what they've been telling us. And the reason why their panic
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.840]   was so visceral last night, and all these postgame wrap-up shows is they saw their
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.040]   credibility going down the drain. They saw that they had been exposed. It wasn't just the fact
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.800]   that Biden was exposed. They were exposed for putting out this North Korea level propaganda
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.120]   for months and years. And everybody should understand these people were part of the cover
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.360]   up. It wasn't just the Biden team who wants to hold on to their jobs. It was the media,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.960]   it was this entire Democratic Party apparatus. They're all in on this giant con.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.000]   I wouldn't have a problem with this, Sax, if it was like Reagan, where they were like,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.280]   God, he's got 18 months left, we're going to ride this thing out. And yeah, maybe we let him have a
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   quiet thing. But to actually put them up for another four years is the issue here. If they
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.840]   just said, listen, we can 25th Amendment this guy or let him finish the last six months. That's
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   one thing. But to say we want four more years of this? I mean, how much worse is it going to get?
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.600]   Hey, what's going to happen right now, I guarantee you is he's out, we're gonna have President
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.080]   Kamala, she's going to get her flowers for four months as she gets to be the first female president
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.000]   of the United States. Then she steps out of the way, she decides she's not going to run because
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.760]   she's got things to do with her family. And there will be two new people who will be moderates.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.800]   And then the real election starts in about 15 days.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.640]   I don't think you need to go into all of those mechanics to get the outcome of a new candidate.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   All Joe Biden has to do is go into the Democratic Convention and release the delegates.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.840]   Yes, of course. Yes, technically.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.920]   But the problem with releasing the delegates is I do think it creates a free for all,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:58.080]   unless the party then exposes this next facet of their plan, which is that they are so
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   in control that they only allow one candidate to go up there.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.080]   Oh, they've already got that. Yeah, that's done.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.960]   And then I think what happens is depending on who that person is,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:14.800]   they'll either I think the Democratic Party is probably at risk of a pretty meaningful reset.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.760]   And I think that these tactics I think are very much seen and understood by the American people.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.440]   I think that people do not like this idea that you vote for person A, but instead you get persons B
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.880]   through Z. I don't think that's what anybody thinks the election for the president of the
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.280]   United States should be. It should be two people independently. And then when you see one person
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.440]   that's not really in a position to run faithfully, I actually think that Donald Trump last night
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.760]   showed tremendous restraint and compassion. I think that is the right way to deal with this
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.040]   situation. I think it's just acknowledging that President Biden is not altogether there.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.400]   So without making claims of a cold or anything else, this is the security and the well-being
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   and the economic prosperity of the most important country in the world. Why are we messing around?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.480]   Let's just put it plainly. The Democratic Party is a collection of interests who wanna
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.560]   remain in power. The Democratic Party is the party of government. Its goal is to allocate
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.720]   money and power from the government to the collection of interests who back the Democratic
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.080]   Party. In other words, it's basically a collection of interests who wanna loot the republic.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   Well, obviously, no one's gonna vote for that. So they have to make it about something else.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.440]   They choose a figurehead. They talk about how this is about saving democracy.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.000]   They basically invent hoax after hoax, lie after lie to basically maintain their power.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.360]   And I think what's happened is the mask has come off. The whole shell game has been revealed.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.680]   It's obvious that Biden was always a puppet for these interests who are hiding behind him,
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.920]   and now it's all being exposed. - This also goes all the way back to 2016,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:56.240]   because if you remember and you look at the real run-up into the 2016 primary,
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.360]   you have to remember President Obama sat Joe Biden down and said, "You cannot run."
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:08.880]   And the reason was to direct the Democratic Party and establishment and energy towards Hillary
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   Clinton, who ultimately lost that election. There's a very important question here, which is,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.120]   if Joe Biden had actually run in 2016, you may have actually had him beat Donald Trump in 2016,
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.840]   and he probably would have continued into 2020. This would be a totally different situation for
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.280]   the Democrats. So back to your point, David, all of these backroom shenanigans and negotiating and
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.600]   gerrymandering and politicking and power-broking is not how democracy should work. As messy as
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:43.360]   the Republicans are, I have to give ... I tip my hat to them. They run very straightforward,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:49.440]   fair, visible, transparent face-offs between people. And you may not like the candidates,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.800]   but the process is what it's supposed to be. Messy, turbulent, but you see all sides. Whereas
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.680]   this tends to be managed from the inside out. And I think that that is, as your point, being exposed,
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.160]   and I think that's what really has to stop within the Democrats. They need to open the floodgates.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.840]   A Bobby Kennedy should have had the chance to run. Dean Phillips should have actually had the chance
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.240]   to run, but they were not, and they were prevented. And by the way, props to Dean Phillips,
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   who, in a very respectful and compassionate way, was telling the truth from day one. And he was
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.200]   essentially censored. He was not allowed to basically tell you what he-
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.640]   Ostracize. Yeah.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.760]   He told everybody what he observed in front of his face.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:34.800]   Right. And if people had listened a year ago to Dean Phillips, then the voters in the Democratic
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.680]   primary could have made a different choice. They could have maybe replaced Joe Biden, but
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   the party elders and the powers that be did not let that happen. And now they're in a panic a
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.880]   year later trying to do a hot swap, because it's manifest to everyone, to the American public, that
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.720]   Joe Biden is not fit to serve. But the real time to... Hold on, let me just speak to the hot swap
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.560]   for a second. The time to do the hot swap was a year ago, when Democratic primary voters could
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.680]   have voted for someone new. The problem you have now, Jay Kal, I actually think that on balance,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.200]   the hot swap is not going to happen. Let me just tell you why. I think you make a really good
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:18.240]   argument for it. Nonetheless, the reason it's not going to happen is that Joe Biden and Jill Biden
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.640]   have come out this morning and said, "There's no way that he's stepping down. It was just one bad
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.960]   night. He's fit to serve." There is no mechanism to replace a nominee who's already won all the
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.640]   necessary primary votes without their consent. So if the Bidens are saying, "We're not stepping
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.360]   down," there's no mechanism to force them to step down. And that's the situation we're in right now.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.040]   It's a very simple mechanism. He's going to capitulate, and you're going to have Obama.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.440]   Obama's going to give him a call. I guarantee you, Obama's going to talk to him in the next 72 hours.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.080]   Guarantee the hot swap happens. I'm absolutely willing to make a bet with you right now on it.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.240]   Let me finish my point. They can pressure him, and that's what you're talking about is they're
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.200]   going to try and leverage him out. But the truth of the matter is that if they can't find the right
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   leverage points, he does not have to step down. The right leverage point is very simple. He's not
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.680]   going to get any more donations. Last night, the Democrats who are donating all said, "No more
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.360]   money for Joe Biden." So he's going to have no oxygen. You need money to run these things.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:21.120]   Just one other final problem with the hot swap theory is not only is there no mechanism to force
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.880]   Biden to do it, but I don't think there's a consensus right now on who the replacement
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:30.480]   would be. The fact of the matter is that Kamala Harris is next in line, and she polls even worse
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.920]   numbers than Biden does. So there's every reason to believe that she would do worse than Biden in
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.880]   the election. And I think it's not going to be easy to basically shiv her and push her aside.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.280]   And so you can talk about Newsom, you can talk about Michelle Obama, you can talk about Hillary
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.720]   Clinton. The fact of the matter is that I think you're going to have a big Kamala problem. And
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.240]   because of that, there's no mechanism and there's no clear replacement. I think that although a lot
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.800]   of people are going to say what you said, Jake Al, about the hot swap being desirable, I think
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.680]   at the end of the day, on balance, probably not going to happen. Although certainly, I admit it
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   could. I'll bet you $10,000 right now to whatever charity you want that Biden will not be the
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.000]   nominee. You could be right, but they've got to work out those two problems. They got to work out
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.080]   those two problems. I'm just offering you a $10,000 bet and I'm not giving you any on straight
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   money. I would not bet a lot of money on this because I'm not sure. I'm just raising some
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.120]   problems with the hot swap theory. Okay, free bird. You have you've been a little bit silent
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.320]   here. You want to wrap us out so we can get to the next time I'll wrap us up. I think I'll read
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.280]   the final paragraph of the email I sent to the Democratic Party leader a few months ago. As a
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.400]   coda to this conversation. Here goes. The United States is facing a fiscal crisis, the likes of
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.480]   which the world only sees every few hundred years as world leading nation states overextend
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   themselves take on unaddressable debt loads, increase social programming and eventually
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.600]   collapse under these conditions. The cost to service the interest alone on our federal debt
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.760]   is now greater than a trillion dollars per year. This already exceeds the discretionary defense
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.640]   budget. The debt service expense will only swell as interest rates are unlikely to decline back to
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:11.440]   0%. And I do not subscribe to the easy to refute economic arguments of modern monetary theory.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.040]   Simple arithmetic is all that's needed to discredit it. Furthermore, I can identify
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.320]   dozens of federal programs sponsored by Democrats that are not achieving their objectives. Yet we
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:26.000]   continue to fund them as if they were performing exactly as anticipated when originally conceived.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.880]   Every federal program should be held to account for performance every year. If not,
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:36.160]   they should be defunded. Instead, I see the party pushing new programs that create new expense
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.640]   burdens without first addressing programs that simply aren't working. Accountability is a
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:46.240]   critical first step in reducing our federal deficit below 7% of GDP. I believe our nation
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.120]   is facing financial and the social peril. I urge the party to become the quote party of reason and
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.320]   results, put forward leaders that can lead hold government programs that aren't working to account,
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.520]   make sure that every dollar spent on social programming has a measurable impact. And if
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.120]   they fail to deliver results, cut them. The opportunity to be the party of reason and
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.360]   results is wide open. Myself and many of my friends would scramble for the opportunity
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   to support that party. That's the end of my statement. And I think did you get a response?
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:18.000]   Then a month later, the handler said, so-and-so has this on their docket. They're going to call
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.200]   you. Never got a call. Of course. Yeah, because you're not a donor. They only care if you donate
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   and you're not a donor. No, because I donated. I donated and I didn't get anything. All I asked
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.320]   for was a chance to sit down and talk to the president. I think we know why Biden didn't
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.280]   come on the podcast. I mean, he couldn't. The debate format, to your point, Freeberg, was like
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.800]   the easiest debate format ever. And the greatest thing, I think Dave Portnoy pointed this out on
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.560]   Twitter, like Trump's best strategy was to just let Biden talk, like, just get out of the way and
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.200]   let him talk. And there was one moment where he's like, I'm sorry. I mean, Trump was pretty graceful
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   here, which is a big statement. He like at one point was like, I'm sorry, I don't understand
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   what he just said. Like, I don't know how to respond to something. I don't understand what his
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:06.240]   point was. Hotswap's coming. And I am an undecided voter. I have a big announcement, Sax. I have a
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.160]   big announcement about my vote. You want to hear it? Yeah, let's hear it. Breaking news. I am not
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.120]   voting for Biden. I've eliminated Biden as possible. I was waiting to see what happened last night.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.080]   So I knew that now I never was clear about that. I am also eliminated Trump. You've also eliminated
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.640]   Bobby Kennedy. So you have not eliminated Trump or Biden Kennedy. I said, I introduce you to Jill
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:33.280]   Stein, maybe Cornel West. Let's move forward. Let's move on. Here we go. Who's left? Bring
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.440]   anybody out. It can't be Weekend at Bernie's part two. I mean, the Weekend at Bernie's joke
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.920]   is real. I mean, it's cruel, and it's real. And my Lord, get it together. All right. There's a
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.320]   really interesting trend going on that I wanted to get everybody's thoughts on AI and corporate
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.600]   efficiency killing tech jobs. Let's pull up this chart. This somebody shared in our group chat from
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:03.200]   Fred. These are software developer job postings on indeed. From early 2020. That's pre COVID,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:11.840]   obviously to this year, look at this. The number of job postings for developers has absolutely
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:18.960]   come crashing down by 80%. This is below pre COVID numbers. In addition to this, we talked about
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.240]   getting back to work, Penske and Dell saying you have to be back in the office starting this fall
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:31.440]   four days a week or resignation accepted. What are you seeing in your portfolios? Any thoughts on
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:39.600]   this trend of the major jobs, the high paying elite jobs, Chamath? Maybe going away? This is
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.360]   a trend we haven't seen in our lifetimes. There's always room for elites at elite companies. And now
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:52.240]   it seems the demand's gone. What's going on here? I just think that company formation has changed
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.960]   after the end of ZURP. And so I think that that chart speaks more to a couple things. One is that
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:03.040]   where typically, people were hiring for software engineering roles, which was a lot of SAS
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.800]   businesses contracted a lot. And the net new amount of SAS startups, also, I don't think
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:14.640]   materially increased. And so that was one big switch. Second is you went through a whole bunch
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.280]   of layoffs at the big cap tech companies as they reestablish profitability. I think when you layer
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:27.600]   those two things, that explains that chart more than the emergence of AI tools. Just practically,
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.680]   what I see is all of these AI tools can add a 10 or 15% lift to an individual person. If you are in
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.880]   a traditional organization, I don't think these things are the panacea that they're marketed as
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.520]   being. These are not creating 10x engineers. At some point, these tools will be good enough.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.280]   And at some point, companies will get started from scratch that use those tools
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   and create a level of productivity at one 10th of the workforce, but that hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.160]   So I think that that chart is more about layoffs and contraction in tech more than anything else.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:06.080]   Yeah. And just to explain this chart a little bit more in depth, the 100% number back in 2020,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.840]   then boosts up to two and a half times that amount, and then comes back down to 60% of
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.600]   that amount. So it's an index, we don't actually have the raw numbers here of the number of
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.000]   developer jobs open or closed. Sax, your thoughts, what are you seeing in company formation to
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Chamath's point? And overall, what do you think this means for the American elite workforce,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.200]   people with, you know, really high end degrees and really high end salary expectations?
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:37.040]   Well, I agree with Chamath, it's just too soon for AI to be responsible for this. I mean,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.640]   the AI productivity gains are just starting, and we're not really seeing job elimination yet or
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.560]   job replacement. I think this is just a symptom of economic weakness. And the main reason for the
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:56.720]   economic weakness is the rate hike cycle. Remember, we went from practically 0% interest rates to five
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.640]   and a half percent in one year. And a lot of people were expecting that to cause a recession.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.720]   That's normally what happens when you get a very, very rapid rate hike cycle is it sucks liquidity
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.280]   out of the economy, and it contracts economic activity and you get a recession. I was one of
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.640]   the people who thought that and that didn't happen. I think one of the reasons it didn't
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.080]   happen is there was a huge backlog of jobs of sort of open job postings. I think originally,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.720]   it started at 12 million open jobs. Well, what's happened is the rise in interest rates has created
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.800]   some economic weakness, it's caused a reduction in liquidity and investment, it's created more
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.600]   pressure on companies to be profitable. And so all those things have cascaded through and what
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.960]   it's doing is it's burning off this job backlog. So we haven't necessarily seen unemployment yet,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.080]   but we're seeing a reduction in the job postings. And I think that's what's going on. And I would
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.760]   just say that the economy may not be in recession yet, but I just think it's weak. And this is just
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.200]   one metric showing that. Freiburg, you're running a company now, you're doing hiring qualitatively,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   what you're seeing in terms of hiring from when you were running production board, you had many
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.600]   companies, people were fighting it out in the peak Zurp era, you know, and giving people incredible,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.880]   incredible, you know, compensation packets and packages. And then you also had like sort of
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.480]   people trying to take talent and maybe talent hoarding was going on. It seems to have dramatically
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.360]   switched. We've been putting job postings out and seeing hundreds of people apply for jobs that we
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.960]   would get dozens previously. What are you seeing? What's the game on the field in terms of hiring?
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.400]   I'm not really, I don't really have a great perspective on this where we hire very specialized
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.120]   people at Ohalo. And in the special specialty field we're in, we're the best in the world.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.680]   So everyone wants to work here. Got it.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.840]   I'll answer your question, Jake. I mean, what I see from our portfolio companies is hiring
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.920]   has got easier. It is way higher, much easier to hire devs, right now software developers than
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.680]   two years ago, no question about it. Yeah. And I think globalization also
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.600]   having a big impact here. I honestly, my theory on this is that because there's not three competing
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.120]   offer sacks from big tech, when you're a startup, you know, trying to land somebody and you're like,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.400]   we have to beat Uber or Airbnb or Coinbase, you know, like a mid market company, or the Google
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.520]   offer, the Apple offer, the Amazon offer, typically, like a developer would have those three
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.080]   sets of offers. Here's a startup that's willing to give you 1% of the equity. Here's a mid market
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.120]   company and Uber and Airbnb or Coinbase, that's offering you 300k. And then here's the like,
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.760]   incredible $500,000 offer from Amazon or Google, those offers just aren't there. So then it makes
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.840]   for the ability for startups to hire great talent. This is the best time possible to be a startup,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.680]   the talent on the field is incredible. Open AI is considering a for profit,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:52.560]   profit conversion. And that means possibly an IPO soon. According to reports, Sam Altman recently
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.320]   discussed this with major shareholders like maybe Microsoft, and it's possible OpenAI will become a
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.360]   for profit benefit corporation similar to Anthropic or XAI. If you don't know what a for profit
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   benefit corporation is a benefit corporation or B Corp in the industry means you have a stated
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   mission that the board is responsible for going after, you know, save the whales, provide AI
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:21.120]   software for all of humanity, whatever it is, in addition to the standard acting in the interest
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:26.880]   of all shareholders. And so this, of course, means OpenAI, which was valued at 86 billion
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.120]   could IPO at some point. What are your thoughts on this? We saw the revenue numbers are crushing it.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.360]   Any thoughts Chamath on OpenAI IPO? Is that a possibility in your mind?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.480]   I mean, it makes so much sense for them. So I think they should do it as quickly as possible.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:50.880]   We are in the first inning of what should probably be an enormous tectonic shift in technology.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.400]   And I think if anything, whoever wins in the first inning usually isn't the one that's winning by the
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:02.480]   ninth inning. And so I would encourage anybody that's winning right now to monetize, get secondaries,
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.680]   take money off the table as fast as possible, because the future is unknown. And the more
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.840]   disruptive the technology is, the more entropy there is, which means that there's going to be
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   more changes, not less. And again, I would just look at search as an example, I would look at
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.640]   social networking as an example. When you look 20 years later, the people who captured all the value
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.960]   were not the ones at the beginning who everybody thought was going to win. And so I think if it
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.760]   plays out similarly, it's important for the people that are in the lead today to recognize it's too
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:36.000]   early, and they should monetize their perceived success as quickly as they can to the largest
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.760]   magnitude possible. In other words, you might be opening, you might be, you might be my space.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.920]   Yeah, grab the bag if you can. Grab the bag. What is it called? Secure the bag. Sorry,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.840]   secure the bag. Secure the bag, yes. What are your thoughts here? SACs on a potential IPO by
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.280]   Sam and the team at OpenAI and the impact that might have on the wider space?
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.520]   Well, for a long time on this show, I've been saying that you need to clean up that,
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.920]   you know, convoluted Byzantine corporate structure with all the line charts everywhere.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:10.160]   That structure is what created all the problems with this nonprofit board that they had.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.760]   You've got a for profit entity reporting to a nonprofit board. It created a culture clash,
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.240]   and as we've said before on the show, it's not a good idea for a startup to innovate on structure.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:27.200]   Using a tried and true C-corp is the way to go. You're ready for IPO. If you ever get that far,
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.440]   you don't need to like restructure the company. It was always funky and weird
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.560]   that OpenAI had this nonprofit structure, and really, they should have fixed it years ago.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:44.160]   And like I said, given Elon his equity, given Sam his CEO package, and they didn't do either
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.280]   one of those things, and so now they're left with this crazy org chart that's a mess.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.320]   And I'm not even sure, I mean, I think you would want to clean it up as soon as you can,
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.120]   because I think my sense is that the longer you wait on these things, the harder it actually gets.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.680]   Yeah, the more calcified these things get, yeah.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.800]   I'm not sure how easy it is to actually fix this thing, but yes, they should fix it.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.160]   They should make it a standard C-corp. They should make things right with Elon,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.200]   because he provided the first 40 million of C-capital. They should make it right with Sam,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.760]   he should get his CEO comp, and then they should IPO so that the public actually has the ability
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:28.720]   to invest in this AI wave and ride this wave the same way they did with the whole dot-com
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   boom in the late '90s. I mean, a lot of those dot-com companies didn't work out,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.920]   but some of them did. Amazon, Google, and so on. And the public had the opportunity to participate
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.600]   in that huge wave of innovation. And I think we'd go to something like that.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.560]   We still need more public companies, right? Freeberg, you got a thought here
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.800]   before we go into superintelligence and Ilya's new company?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.680]   I don't care if OpenAI's for-profit or non-profit affects a few people that put money in and the
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.920]   employees. It doesn't affect anyone else. Well, no, it will affect the public if they can buy
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.960]   shares and they get to participate. You could say that about any business, right?
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.200]   OpenAI is one of the leading companies of the AI wave.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.480]   It is the leading company.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.760]   It's the leading company.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.840]   They apparently raised money in an $80 billion valuation. So one could also argue that a company
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.760]   doing $3 billion in revenue, getting an IPO done at $120 billion market cap,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.640]   maybe the public already missed the big wave.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.480]   Well, no, I don't think so. I mean, we saw a lot of these companies that you could have said that
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.520]   about NVIDIA and it basically went up 30x. Yeah, you could say that about any IPO. It
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.760]   could go up, it could go down. But anyway, there's a bunch of people who put money in
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.240]   who are going to make a lot of money if this thing gets to be for-profit.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   Yeah, but the trend line is it's doubling revenue, right, year over year. So, yeah.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.200]   My argument is that it'd be good for OpenAI to clean up its Byzantine cap table and structure,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.480]   and it would be good for the public to be able to have the opportunity to invest. So it's a
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.640]   win-win. I'm not saying they have to do it this minute. I mean, I think that it does take time
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   to get your reporting to the level of maturity necessary to be a public company. And you don't
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.560]   want your earnings or your revenue, you don't want your numbers to be volatile.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.160]   If you were an employee, Freeberg, and it went out at $120 billion,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.200]   would you clear your position if you could? Would you sell half your position?
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.080]   I don't know enough. I don't know enough. I'm assuming most of those...
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.560]   Sak, Chamath, anybody want to play along here?
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.440]   Well, I've heard that they've had quite a bit of turnover because there's been pretty
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.040]   good secondary market activity, which means a lot of the employees have cashed out and
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.880]   they've made so much money, just like what's happening at NVIDIA now. There's very little
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.160]   upside relative to how much money you've already made. So at that point, a lot of
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.960]   the early people start to leave. Cash in your chips.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.200]   Yeah. So they're trying to hire more people, it sounds like.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:39.040]   I heard 70% of employees at NVIDIA are millionaires now. That's a crazy number. Go ahead, Sak.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.400]   Well, I was going to say, that question that you asked is really a highly personal question
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.240]   because you could think that OpenAI is a great company that's going to be worth a trillion
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.960]   dollars in the future, but it still makes sense for you to take chips off the table because 100%
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.640]   of your net worth is in that one company. So...
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.200]   Well, let me ask it that way. You got 90% of your net worth in NVIDIA. I'm sorry, 90%
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.040]   of your net worth. You're a person at OpenAI sitting on $10 million in shares. Do you sell
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.760]   half or all? What would you do personally, Saks?
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.880]   I would take some chips off the table. I don't...
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   Half? If you were first, if you're like, this is 90% of your net worth, 99% of your net worth.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.760]   Well, I mean, you're an insider, so maybe you have a lot of information.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.200]   If you were really bullish on the future of the company, maybe you take 10 or 20% of your
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.240]   chips off the table. If you're less bullish, maybe it is 50%. So, I don't know. I'd be
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.320]   influenced by my perspective on that, but I think that you could think it's the greatest
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.480]   company in the world and still, it would make sense for you to take some chips off the table
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.560]   because you don't want all your eggs in one basket. That's a personal diversification decision.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.520]   And if it was $120 billion valuation with $3 million in revenue, Chamath,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.920]   and you're trading a 40X or whatever it is times next year's revenue, let's assume they do $5
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.840]   billion next year, you're still looking at 30X revenue, you would clear?
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.480]   I think these multiples are not really what's going to drive their behavior. I think OpenAI
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.440]   is running a very strategic game plan to become part of the tech establishment as quickly as they
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:13.920]   can so that they are on the inside looking out as opposed to the outside looking in. They
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.960]   were able to add the former head of the NSA to their board of directors.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.880]   Yeah, what was your take on that, by the way, Chamath? That was interesting. People got pretty-
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.040]   Well, it's how you become part of the establishment. I mean, do you think the
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.840]   former head of the NSA no longer has a security clearance or knows people in the NSA? No,
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:40.000]   of course not. And I think that there is a group of people that want to make sure that these kinds
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.720]   of technologies and capabilities are firmly within the hands of the United States apparatus and not
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.440]   anybody else. And so, I think that that pulls them closer to the kinds of folks that could
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:55.120]   otherwise give them a hard time or regulate them or et cetera, et cetera. So now what happens is
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.520]   when you have Senate hearings about this stuff, it's more likely that it's confidential behind
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.960]   closed doors, it's under the purview of national security. All these things are beneficial to
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.520]   OpenAI. And then secondly, they were able to get Elon to drop his lawsuit. Conveniently,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   I think it was like on the same day that the head of the NSA was added to the board of the
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.280]   former head of the NSA. So, the next logical step is now to create capital markets distribution,
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.600]   which is really about syndicating ownership of the company to all the big deep pools of money
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.680]   so that they are also rolling in the same direction in support of OpenAI. And so,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.760]   that's what a lot of people don't get. It's not about valuations or this and that. This is about
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.480]   creating a high level game theory of how to create an international apparatus that supports your
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.160]   corporate objectives. There are a few companies that have done this well and they are now one of
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:51.280]   them. The only thing left is to get shares into the hands of the Black Rocks, the T-Rows, all the
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.360]   big mutual fund apparatuses of the world that then syndicate to all the individual investors of the
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.320]   world. And you have everything. You have government connections, you have no real legal overhang.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.280]   Then the likelihood that an IRS agent all of a sudden decides to audit OpenAI is basically zero.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:12.560]   Okay. So, to summarize, a bit cynical, but you're building an ally base that then makes
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.360]   it harder to investigate the company, criticize the company or anything like that, right? That's
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.880]   essentially what you're saying. I don't think it's cynical. It's like a smart business strategy.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.040]   Strategy. What's your take on that, Sax? Well, yeah, they're borrowing their way
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:32.480]   into the deep state. Okay. I mean, the quid pro quo is we will be your vessel. We will be an arm
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:39.200]   of the intelligence community of the deep state. We'll give you access to whatever it is you're
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:44.640]   looking for. And in exchange, you're going to basically protect us and allow us to get rich.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:50.080]   And frankly, that's the deal that all the big tech companies have made. They are all in bed
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:56.880]   with the intelligence community. And we saw this in the Twitter files, where every week for the
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.240]   year before the 2020 election, there were meetings between the trust and safety people, the censorship
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:08.400]   division of Twitter and the intelligence community. So these people are working arm in arm.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:14.560]   And basically, the big tech companies have given themselves over in a way to this powerful
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.920]   apparatus, this, you know, the deep state in exchange for, you know, they're willing to
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.640]   basically give up power in exchange to be left unfettered to make their money. I think it's a
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:30.560]   horrible development for the civil liberties of the ordinary American. But I think that is the
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:37.520]   reality of what has transpired. Yeah, the number of CIA, former CIA, former FBI, Justice Department
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:43.920]   people working at the Googles, Facebook's metas apples of the world is like a very large number.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.960]   I have family, as many of you know, in law enforcement and in the deep state, I guess,
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:56.160]   I should call it sex. And they are constantly asking me about job offers they have from these
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.480]   companies and should which one should they go to this is after they've done tours in Afghanistan,
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.120]   and, you know, speaking many different foreign languages, and then all of a sudden, they secure
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:11.040]   this incredible, you know, three x salary bump by working in big tech. So there is something to all
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:18.080]   of this. Ilya announced his new startup. Finally, it's called safe super intelligence, Inc, or SSI.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:25.120]   He was obviously an open AI co founder, formerly the chief scientist and co head of super alignment.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.600]   Last month, he announced he was resigning from open AI after a decade with the company.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.840]   And you remember, he was on the board that helped orchestrate Sam Altman's firing. And then he
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:41.120]   reverse course a few days after and expressed regret in it. Everybody was asking where's Ilya
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:47.360]   doing all of this on Twitter. The co founders in SSI include Daniel gross, a YC partner,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.440]   and Pioneer Labs co founder and open AI engineer Daniel Levy. company's goal right now is in the
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:59.200]   title develop a safe super intelligence. Here's what Ilya told Bloomberg the company is special
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.400]   in that its first product will be the safe super intelligence and it will not do anything else.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:12.160]   Until then, Friedberg is this super intelligence, making safe super intelligence a great business
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:18.880]   model? Or is this something else? It's a little bit confusing to come into the market and compete
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.960]   with a throttle or a governor, I guess on your startup. At least that's what some people are
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.400]   discussing. So what are your guys? No idea. I don't know what these guys are doing. Have you
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.760]   guys looked at this company? I haven't seen anything. Well, I mean, we're just basing it
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:41.200]   on this question. Yeah. Okay. Okay, quick bounce pass to Zach. Zach. Yeah. Give us your opinion.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:47.120]   The caveat what I'm about to say by by saying that I have not heard the pitch directly for this
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.400]   company, I've only read what you've read in the press, what they're trying to do is the safe,
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:58.960]   super intelligence. And I'm not bullish about that pitch. Because I think it, it makes the
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.800]   company a little bit schizophrenic. It's working at cross purposes with itself. On the one hand,
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.960]   you're a new company, which means you're behind, you've got to catch up with open AI,
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.360]   or Google, these other companies that now have been creating, you know, models for years.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.680]   So you've got to move very fast. On the other hand, you're saying you're going to basically
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:22.400]   make this very safe. Well, to be frank, safety concerns are a brake pedal. They don't help you
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:29.920]   move faster. They make you move slower. Yes. And in fact, I think that this is the main reason why
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:35.760]   Sam Altman either kick these people out of the company or starve their resources until they left.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.400]   Remember that when a bunch of these people left open AI, they said that, hey, we were originally
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.920]   promised 30% of the computing resources by Sam. And then he reneged on that promise and give us
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:52.080]   what we needed. So they all left. Well, I think that was, that wasn't by accident. I mean, I think
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:58.640]   that Sam wants to win, he wants to develop AI as quickly as possible, specifically AGI. And he had
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.680]   this group inside the company that frankly, was a lobby for moving slower. So now they have their
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:09.600]   own startup kicked out. Right. And so I don't but I don't think that's the recipe for winning.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.920]   Because no, you're the guys who want to move slower. It'd be like taking the DEI group from
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.240]   Twitter and having them start a new Twitter. Well, I think that's a little bit harsh, because I do
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   think that by all accounts, Carpathia is like a top top notch technologist. And he's one of the
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.680]   leaders in the space. Yeah, but I do think that he's going to be hamstrung by his own concerns
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:38.000]   about safety. And I think this is maybe that the tragic situation is, we're going to have this
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:45.040]   competition by all these different companies to advance AI and the companies that care about safety
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.920]   more than others are going to lose. And so you have this Darwinian effect going on where there's
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:56.640]   going to be a race to AGI. And I think that is genuinely a little bit scary for where this this
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:02.800]   all leads us. But I tend to think that it's not going to be solved by trying to impose the safety
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.640]   governor, as you said, I think maybe the best you can do is impose a truth governor. So you know,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:14.160]   Elon says that we're going to make sure that our model at XAI, the grok model is scrupulously
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:21.200]   honest, it's not going to lie to you. And I think maybe that's the best you can do is is advance AI
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.800]   to be truthful. But when you start injecting these other safety concerns, I just think it slows you
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   down and hamstrings you. I think the best way to hit truth is to cite your sources I have been
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.120]   putting into and I don't know if you have you played with four Oh, yet or Claude's new sonnet
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:43.920]   Jamaat. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it is unbelievably good. If you put cite your sources, it's really
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.040]   starting to understand what you're asking for. I don't know if you've seen this, but I was asking
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.480]   it. Like I'm hiring some positions, give me the high low average of this position, give me five
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.360]   sources of information, put it in a table, and then average the high, low and median. And it
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:04.960]   came back to me sacks with an incredible thread, Jamal of this position, and then source glass door,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:12.320]   you know, indeed, salary calm, whatever it was. And I was like, holy cow, this is an hour or two
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:18.080]   of research or work done instantly. There's an important insight here that I think people are
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:24.800]   missing, which is that foundational models are quickly becoming a consumer surplus. Every model
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.560]   is roughly the same, they keep getting better and better. But they're also approaching these
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:34.000]   asymptotic returns. And what do you do when something approaches an asymptotic return,
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.520]   you need to change a key underlying variable that you use to build these models. And it looks like
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.440]   one of those variables that people are looking at is how you basically take the internet,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.800]   not as raw data, but then you actually kind of refine it and refine it some more, and then use
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:55.520]   that as the basis of learning. And what that does is it drives up model costs to a degree that are
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.400]   probably untenable for most companies, except but for a few. So I think it was Dario Amadei,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:07.280]   the CEO of entropic, who said, the cost of a good functional model today is in the billions. But you
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:14.560]   know, by 2027, it could easily approach $100 billion. The problem that that represents for
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.720]   Ilya's company, and I wish him the best of luck, but the reality is there isn't $100 billion for
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.000]   him to have, Google will find it, Microsoft will find it, Facebook will find it, Amazon is coming
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.400]   out, open AI will probably find it, Amazon will find it. But I suspect that these other startups,
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   there just isn't that much money going into AI because the returns don't justify it. So
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.480]   I think the bigger problem that you have is that it's becoming an arms race. It's not dissimilar
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.320]   actually to ride sharing. When people saw Uber's success, they thought, well, this is simple.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.400]   And it was, but you had to subsidize losses for decades before that company was profitable. But
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.480]   meanwhile, you had to starve all of these other companies that were funded to compete with Uber
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.760]   until they ran out of money and died. I think that you could make a claim that the AI foundational
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.440]   model market will look similar to that. One startup can probably win, but there will be a
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.440]   bunch of open source alternatives. They're all asymptotically similar. And so it's an arms race
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.240]   on cost and compute. And I just don't see VCs having the temperament and the wherewithal to
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.120]   fund hundreds of billions of dollars into multiple companies to do that.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.800]   Friberg, any thoughts on the latest models? Have you played with them? I'm curious.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.040]   I have been having tremendous results. There seems like there is, I don't know,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.400]   I don't want to say a step function, but man, it's a lot better right now.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.200]   Have you used any of these models? And are you applying any of them inside of your company?
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.480]   We're using a lot more models. And we're seeing them be very practically applied at the edge. So
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.560]   you don't need to have large models running on a large compute cloud to get practical value. And
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:51.520]   this is definitely a big, a big point in the industry is that you're getting highly functional,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:58.160]   application specific models that can be run in a more local environment on the edge. So they're
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.920]   not running the cloud on big compute clusters. And there's incredible applications in things like
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.560]   machine vision and control systems. You're going to ultimately see this being I don't know if you
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:16.000]   guys saw that Chinese dog, we never talked about this. China basically ripped off Boston Dynamics,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.200]   or at least that's what it looks like. And they created this military dog, Nick,
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.720]   can you pull up the clip, and then they put machine guns on the back of the dogs back,
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.120]   the models are running locally in these devices. In fact, I think we're gonna have a few
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.640]   demonstrations of this at the at the island summit. So the robotic applications are pretty
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.520]   powerful. Machine vision applications are very powerful. And when you see this insane video from
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.760]   China, by the way, this is a totally different topic. You guys seen this? I have seen this.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.040]   It's this thing goes autonomously into a building, and it can then find its target and eliminate its
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.920]   target with the machine gun on the back. Incredible. And you can see this becoming
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.560]   like, let's say they build a assembly line, and they put out 10 million 50 million of these things.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.200]   And these things can now go run autonomously in the field. This is the dark side of small,
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.080]   highly performative application specific models running in an embedded way.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.040]   Imagine those are amphibious. And they could travel against, they could travel across water
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.080]   and wind up in another destination. I don't know where would a beach invasion occur.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.240]   Anyway, that was a very funky tangential aside.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.720]   All right. We've talked about Microsoft and the bundling issues a number of times here.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.520]   Thanks. You had a spicy take on this. Well, the EU just charged Microsoft with antitrust
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:36.320]   violations over how it bundles teams. They're quote unquote, slack killer into office. Here's
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.480]   a quick chart. Microsoft Teams obviously was bundled. Everybody has it automatically with
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.960]   office. You don't get a choice and they rocketed to 75 million members. 2022 slacks 12 million.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.720]   You've obviously got a lot of thoughts here. I'm sure to as well.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.680]   Come on, since you were the early investor in this. Looks like Salesforce just got a big win.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.040]   Benioff gave some commentary on X Microsoft excels with bundling. It's not it's they're
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.760]   not so secret weapon for dominating new markets. We know the playbook office plus teams,
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:17.840]   Windows plus Explorer, Azure plus Visual Studio, 365 plus OneDrive and Xbox plus game Xbox plus game
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.760]   pass. Here's a clip of sacks discussing this on episode 113 of your all in podcast.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:30.480]   If Microsoft can basically clone the sort of the breakthrough innovative product,
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.560]   you know, just to say they do one every year and then they put a crappy version of that
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:41.120]   bundle. Yeah. 10% or 50% worse, but they give it away effectively for free as part of the bundle.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.280]   And then they basically pull the legs out from under that other companies. So it can't be a
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.120]   vibrant competitor. And then the next year they'll just raise the price of the bundle.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.080]   Right. And they've done that with Slack. They've done that with Okta. They've done that with zoom.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   Can we have a vibrant tech ecosystem, at least in b2b software, if Microsoft can just keep doing
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.960]   that indefinitely? All right, sacks, you heard your quote there. I'm guessing you're not shocked
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.800]   by this action. Well, I think the EU made the right decision here. They basically sided with
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.880]   Salesforce who made the complaint and said that Microsoft was engaged in illegal bundling.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:24.640]   By combining Microsoft office and teams. And the reality is Microsoft office is a product that every
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:30.960]   company has to have every, certainly every enterprise has to have. And by bundling,
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.040]   it means that that enterprise receives the team's product for free until of course the price of the
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.280]   bundle goes up the next year, which it has just about every single year. So what that does is
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:49.760]   when that enterprise is evaluating the choice of do we use teams or do we use Slack or for example,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:56.880]   glue or some other tool teams on the margin appears to be free. Whereas Slack is something
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.400]   you have to pay for seats. And I think that is, that is illegal bundling. You know, when you have
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.240]   a monopoly in one product and you systematically use it to keep adding new products that again,
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.280]   on the margins appear to be free because you've bundled them. And I think the EU has done the
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   right thing here, which is push to end the bundling. Every single product needs to have
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.520]   its own a la carte pricing. And when you add together the a la carte prices, it should equal
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.760]   the price of the bundle. So in other words, you don't get anything on the margin for free.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.480]   The customer needs to have the discretion to choose what it wants. If we don't do that,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:38.960]   I do think that Microsoft will use the power of the bundle to systematically dominate enterprise
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.280]   software. And they won't take on everybody at once. But like I said, they'll every year,
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.680]   they'll add a new product to the bundle.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.400]   Chamath what's the what's the middle ground here between the interest of consumers,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.320]   which is, hey, I'm getting free, a free version of Slack.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.480]   It's not free, it appears to be free on the margins, because it's not part of the bundle.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.720]   But then they raise the price of the bundle the next year.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.800]   Correct. They boil the frog. So
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.920]   so once they killed, once they pulled the legs out, pull the rug out from under their competition,
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.080]   yes, that competitor is no longer viable. Now they can raise the price of the bundle.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.720]   Okay. And so it's kind of like dumping in a way. I mean, this is a very old antitrust argument.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.280]   When you would dump product in the market to kill a competitor, or you would price under your cost
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.560]   to kill a competitor, right?
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.280]   Yeah, you dump to basically drive a competitor out of business, because there's large
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.360]   cost of entry, there's large capex required to create a new competitor.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.400]   And, and this is this is basically what they're doing is they appear to give you
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:43.040]   they appear to give you the the Slack clone or whatever, for free. But then once they
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.240]   pulled the rug out, they'll increase the price of the bundle.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Chamath what's the balance here between say, I don't know, Apple giving away a free note
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.200]   pay note taking app or a free journaling app to consumers and hey, consumers get this benefit
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.600]   of free product versus the bundling concept here with, hey, we'll give it to you for free,
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.560]   but eventually we're gonna boil the frog. What's your thought of how to adjudicate this,
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.840]   or to execute on it? Microsoft's interest of consumers.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.280]   Microsoft has been bundling to bundling products to kill competitors for 40 years.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.440]   The the 10 years that they didn't do it was the 10 years when Steve Ballmer was in charge,
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.640]   during which there was a legal document between Microsoft and the Justice Department,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:35.120]   a consent decree that prevented them from doing it. That consent decree came to be because of
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.080]   this exact strategy. And the most famous example that was the tail end of that process was when
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.040]   they used Internet Explorer and they bundled it with Microsoft Windows and they killed Netscape.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:52.560]   Right? So there's umpteen examples of this. So I think that they've gone back to their
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.880]   old playbook. It's a playbook that you have to remember the executives that run Microsoft have
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.800]   been there for 30 and 40 years. They know this play and they know that it works and
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.440]   they've been rewarded incredibly handsomely by the public markets. So they're gonna keep doing it.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:11.440]   Would Slack have sold to Salesforce? Now, look, I'm not complaining. It was a $27 billion acquisition.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.600]   But the question is, if it were allowed to compete feature for feature,
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.880]   could it have beat teams? Possibly. Would the board have made, and I was on the board of Slack,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.560]   a decision to have tried? Possibly. But none of those options were on the table.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.800]   Because when you see a product, it doesn't matter how inferior it is, get bundled in,
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.600]   it's kind of DOA. And then you're on a melting iceberg. And so you have to make a very quick
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.040]   decision to preserve enterprise value. So I think what this comes down to is the FTC and the DOJ
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:49.840]   need to dust off that old consent decree, read it, and figure out whether this makes sense again.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.400]   It seems like folks in the EU have more recently read that consent decree than American regulators
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.560]   have. Look, what we've said all along is that the right approach to antitrust is to stop
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.440]   anti-competitive tactics. Bundling is at the top of the list. Instead, what they've stopped is all
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.120]   M&A, which is actually bad for the ecosystem, because you deny risk, capital, or reward.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.680]   And you need that reward in order to induce the next stage of risk taking.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.440]   So again, I think this was a good decision by the EU regulators and the competition authorities in
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.160]   the US should actually be looking to this. Again, it's a better approach than stifling M&A.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.800]   You are so right on this. We're so aligned. If you look at, I've been talking to a lot of LPs,
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:39.120]   and in talking to them, they're looking at corporate credit and P&E deals because they
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.640]   can get a return on those. And then they're looking at venture, and they're saying, "Hey,
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.480]   why is there no M&A occurring? Where's our DPI? Can you guys sell some of these companies?"
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:52.160]   It's like, "Yeah, we can't sell them because Lena Kahn's going to scuttle this M&A."
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:00.240]   And what that means is, in a very real way, we have dollars being taken out of innovation in
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.800]   early stage and being put into privatizing SaaS companies, whatever, real estate deals.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.120]   And this is really dangerous for America. We really need more of this.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.640]   I'll make one last wrap on this topic. I'll take the other side of bundling.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.160]   Oh, here we go.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:24.800]   I think ultimately, if bundling benefits the consumer or the customer from improved prices,
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.600]   I don't buy the antitrust arguments on a lot of these cases. I don't think that you're keeping
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.680]   competitive solutions in the market if the benefit of the lower cost product
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.080]   is actually there for the consumer or the customer. Supermarkets, for example, do this.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.440]   So there's a lot of products in the supermarket, like peanut butter, milk, eggs,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.800]   that have historically been big loss leaders because they get people in the store.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.440]   Once they get in the store...
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.640]   They're not monopolies.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.360]   They're effectively...
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.320]   Peanut butter's not a monopoly.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.000]   Bundling. Monopoly in what way?
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:52.480]   The supermarket's not a monopoly.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.040]   It's fine to bundle commodities, but when a product is a monopoly, and every enterprise must have it...
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Commodities have finite shelf lives. So you're talking about one week.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.560]   And Teams is not a monopoly.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:03.680]   Microsoft Office is.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.480]   When you install it, if Microsoft Office is and 365 is, you can't rip it out.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:08.880]   You can't rip it out.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.240]   There are other options. You have options. There's plenty of options.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:12.560]   You have options, but not...
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.160]   And the whole benefit of SaaS is that you can switch all the time.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.520]   Those options are on market power.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.120]   Of course they do. I can switch to Google Docs and save money.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:19.920]   Microsoft Office is standard.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.880]   It's standard in what?
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.520]   In the enterprise market.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.320]   I don't have to buy it. I don't have to buy enterprise seat licenses for Office.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.600]   I can buy Google Docs.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.120]   SMBs think that way, but enterprises have to have Office.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.800]   Enterprises don't think that way.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.200]   Yeah, I mean...
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.640]   They have every option to.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.600]   Google's competing effectively in the Office space against Microsoft Office.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.040]   Yeah, but you have to look as the duopoly.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040]   Zoom is competing effectively against Teams.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.000]   Like none of these businesses have a monopoly.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.920]   Zoom's had the legs kicked out from under it.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.080]   Yeah, Zoom, I would argue, is getting demolished.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.600]   Slack just stopped growing.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.160]   Look, once they put Teams in the bundle, Slack stopped growing.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.760]   What's the monopolistic lock-in?
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.560]   The amazing thing about SaaS is that there's no switching cost.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.000]   There's no switching cost. What?
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.240]   I don't think we're debating that.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.960]   I think what we're debating is the sales practice where Microsoft says,
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.160]   "Well, you need Office, you need Windows, and you need 365.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.920]   Or, sorry, Active Directory.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.360]   Well, if you'd like all of these things,
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.240]   we're going to give you this product for free as well,
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.840]   and they're going to be tightly integrated."
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.280]   Then when you go to Slack, you have to pay more.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.320]   And then you think to yourself, "Well, how do I go back to my CFO and say,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.960]   'I need an extra $1.2 million a year for this enterprise license to Slack'?"
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.840]   And then people say, "Well..."
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.560]   That's my point.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.320]   You're saving money if you stick with Microsoft.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.680]   They're giving you a discount.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.960]   Because once they kill Slack, they'll just raise the price of the bundle.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.080]   That's the point.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.720]   That's a theory.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.800]   And if that's true, that should be prosecuted.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.320]   I don't think that the idea of a bundle...
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.960]   Which applies under the Microsoft Internet Explorer action.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.560]   But that's the violating action.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.120]   That's my point.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.440]   Why can't you just make Microsoft...
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.000]   The idea of having a bundle should not be a violating action.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.320]   No.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.920]   All Microsoft has to do is they've got a price of the bundle.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.440]   Allocate that price across all the components of the bundle
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.520]   so people can buy each product a la carte.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.320]   That's all.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.160]   They can still sell a bundled offering.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.600]   If at the end of the day, that sum is cheaper than you buying
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.080]   the alternative a la carte from third-party vendors,
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.400]   that is a great deal for you as a customer.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.360]   It can be cheaper.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.160]   But the point is...
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.680]   What we're talking about here is proactively keeping competition.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.240]   And I think that creates a good competitive dynamic.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.640]   But maybe I'm thinking two first principles on this.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.320]   I think you're missing something here, Preebh,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.640]   which is what happens then when, let's just say Slack,
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.000]   there wasn't a suitor for Slack.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.960]   Okay, let's take the internet browser example
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.840]   because I think it's better.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.200]   If you didn't have a multi-hundred-billion-dollar company
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.520]   prop up a product because they just felt like it,
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.880]   i.e. Chrome and Google,
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.120]   you would have had Microsoft run away
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.200]   with the core interface for the internet.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.040]   We don't know how that would have turned out.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.200]   So by luck, we've had some modicum of consumer choice,
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.880]   but it's not as if Firefox did well.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.280]   Firefox went to basically irrelevancy.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.640]   Netscape went to zero.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.200]   So there are examples where when Microsoft has done this,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.800]   they can starve the market of choice
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.240]   over long periods of time.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.320]   And I think if you're, hold on, hold on a second.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.480]   So if your whole point is,
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.640]   well, let's just bet on the largesse
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.280]   of other large companies, that's a bad bet.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   But I will show you multiple counterexamples.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.520]   Google Meet does not dominate market share.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.280]   Again, you're talking about the largesse.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.800]   You're talking about the largesse of companies.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.040]   You're talking not about competitive practices.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.680]   Find me venture-funded people,
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.760]   risk-taking people who need a return on investment.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.280]   Google is the worst example.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.560]   They have the most indiscriminate forms of spending.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.480]   I'm not saying that they shouldn't be allowed to.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.080]   - I'm sorry, I'm giving you a counterexample
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.120]   to the point about bundling.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.640]   - No, that's not a counterexample.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.080]   - Or they have Google Wave
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.160]   or any of these other nonsense products that didn't work.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.400]   You know, I'm not calling Google Meet a nonsense product.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.840]   - The point of a healthy product environment and market
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.200]   is not that one incumbent and another incumbent
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.880]   can create their own crappy versions.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.800]   It's that you could theoretically have an open market
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.360]   where somebody can be funded with nominal amounts of capital
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.720]   and compete effectively.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.200]   That isn't possible in many markets and software
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   because of these kinds of strategies.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.720]   So what you're reduced to are these huge companies
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   with this product sprawl.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.640]   I don't think those are good products.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.280]   And I think we're lying to ourselves to say that they are.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.840]   Google Meet is a terrible product, okay?
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.080]   - Brutal.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.840]   - So whatever they're competing with
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.200]   is a terrible alternative.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.400]   - That's my point.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.840]   And they've lost market share.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.600]   They have not won market share by bundling.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.080]   - And if you try to find a real competitor
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.000]   to build an alternative to it,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.320]   they're not able to get funded
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.760]   because the venture investor says,
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.880]   "No, I can't."
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.320]   And that's the market power that stifles competition.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.000]   That's what this is about.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.720]   - And if you, as an entrepreneur,
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.680]   come up with a much better product than Google Meet,
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.360]   a VC will say, "Wow, we can go
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.880]   and blow up the side of the hull of that ship."
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.000]   - I totally disagree with you.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:44.480]   - "Let's go after it."
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.320]   - I don't think there's a single person.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.720]   - Microsoft bought Skype how many years ago
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.760]   for eight and a half billion dollars
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.640]   and then Zoom came around.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.280]   - If left unchecked, Microsoft will, I mean,
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280]   Zoom is a standalone, unbundled product.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.280]   And they totally dominated the market
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.880]   while everyone else has been doing bundling.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.760]   - The bottom line is, if left unchecked,
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.840]   you will see people abuse this.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.520]   It is not a big ass to have a la carte pricing
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.120]   and that will make the playing field much, much more competitive.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   - The Zoom example is a terrible one.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.400]   And the reason is that P&L would have a hole
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.520]   blown on the side of it
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.200]   if they did not have 90% of their R&D and OPEX in China.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.800]   So, but for the grace of God and Eric's strategic thinking,
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.320]   they were able to survive.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.080]   But that is a perfect example of a company
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.240]   that would absolutely not have existed
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.080]   had they not had a labor arbitrage.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.600]   That is not the basis of a competitive and fair market.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.920]   And you cannot expect people going off
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.000]   to all four corners of the world
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.720]   and trying to do all these gymnastics
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.680]   to viably compete against the Microsoft and a Google.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.240]   - I would argue--
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.920]   - That is not what-- - Figma, Adobe.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.080]   Adobe has a bundling solution.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.240]   If you guys have ever tried to sign up for Adobe
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.320]   or end your subscription, it's nearly impossible.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.400]   - Yeah, they just had action taken against them for that.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.240]   - They've got these insane practices.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.560]   They make you buy everything to get access to one thing.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.320]   - Well, look what they did. - And then Figma comes along
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.480]   and Figma kills the market.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.720]   They come in and they're like, "We're a better product."
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.200]   Better markets do win even with bundling.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.000]   That's my argument.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   - I think the interesting thing with Adobe
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.600]   is that they have a product suite
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.960]   that's used in a narrow field.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.160]   I think what Saxe is saying is,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.840]   Adobe is about a sort of vertical system of record.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.600]   I think what the thing about Microsoft,
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.080]   and you could probably say about Google is, but less so,
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.280]   but definitely for Microsoft,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.520]   is they are these very horizontal,
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.920]   broad, amorphous systems of record
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.840]   that you cannot easily replace.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.360]   There aren't people running around
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.840]   building nine of the 19 things
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.520]   that Microsoft gives you in the bundle.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.480]   That's the problem.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.400]   - Okay, well-- - The debate continues.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.560]   - Furthermore, I mean, on this very show,
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.640]   we are arguing that the Figma acquisition
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.480]   should go through because it created
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.400]   a new market for web designers,
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.680]   whereas Photoshop was basically for graphic designers.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.360]   - No, but Saxe, it doesn't compete with Photoshop.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.200]   It competes with some of their other design programs,
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.800]   but that's, anyway.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.240]   - All right, we're not gonna settle it here.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:00.960]   - I think there's a difference
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.160]   between a bundle and a suite.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.040]   Suites are okay.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.600]   Bundling, when you already have a monopoly
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.520]   in the relevant part of the bundle, that's the problem.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.800]   - Bundling is when you take a wrench
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.560]   and a can of peanut butter and put them together,
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.080]   and you're like, "Here, you're gonna take them both."
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.680]   You're like, "Well, I only need the wrench."
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.880]   "Well, you're gonna take the peanut butter."
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.240]   And they're like, "Well, I already have peanut butter,
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.360]   "so I don't need to buy new peanut butter."
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.520]   - I mean, we saw this in the cable providers
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.880]   and DirecTV as well.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.400]   You know, just, you can't-- - It only works
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.080]   if you're a monopoly. - Not pay for ESPN
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.360]   even if you don't like sports.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.680]   All right, listen, another amazing episode
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.400]   for compassionate Chamath, satire Saxe,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.000]   and the frank-- - Satire Saxe
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.360]   wants to say one more thing.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.800]   - I just have a perfect wrap up--
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.080]   - Please. - Okay, satire Saxe,
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.760]   go ahead, what's your-- - Well, I wanna--
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   - Continue the gloating, here we go, satire Saxe.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.360]   - No, let's put this tweet by Joe Biden, President Biden.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.840]   - Oh, God, it's the elder abuse.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.200]   - No, I wanna compliment Joe Biden on continuing to fight.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.960]   You keep fighting, Joe.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.240]   Do not let the media get you down.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:01.600]   One bad night is not a reason to get out of the race.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.560]   All these people stabbing you in the back,
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.720]   they're basically ingrates and backstabbers.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.240]   You're doing just fine.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.640]   - All right, and from candid Calacanis--
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.400]   - Who? - And from candid Calacanis
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.000]   to the Democratic Party, desgraciad, your disgrace,
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.360]   what you did to the American people
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.200]   with this rope and dope is ridiculous.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.720]   - Desgraciad. - 20, desgraciad!
