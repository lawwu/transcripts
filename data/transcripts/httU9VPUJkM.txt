[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   One of the things about radical candor is that sometimes people hear the term and they assume
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.200]   it is licensed to act like a jerk, which it is not. So if you think about caring and challenging
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.680]   at the same time, those two things, they don't really seem so radical. So why do I call it
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   radical candor? Everyone I've ever met struggles with feedback. They struggle hearing it and they
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.200]   struggle giving it. So you don't want to be obnoxiously aggressive because it's inefficient.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.440]   Like if I'm a jerk to you, Chris, then you go into fight or flight mode and then you literally,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.400]   physically cannot hear what I'm saying. So I'm wasting my breath. When I realize that I've acted
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.880]   like a jerk, it's not actually my instinctive response to move up on the care personally
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.760]   dimension of radical candor. Instead, it's my response to go the wrong way on challenge
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   directly and say, Oh, I'm sorry. It's no big deal. I didn't really mean it, but it is a big deal. And
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.880]   I did mean it, you know, so now I'm basically lying. And so now I've landed in the worst place
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.340]   of all, manipulative insincerity.
