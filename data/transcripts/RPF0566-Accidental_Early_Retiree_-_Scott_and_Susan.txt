[00:05:46.600 --> 00:06:16.100]  iell no matter what you say, you know, I mean we just we felt like we'd had we decided in around that period of time. Maybe a few years before that we weren't going to have kids. Okay, so that you know that kind of changes the formula a little bit. We we thought you know, we're just basically taking responsibility for ourselves. You know, we didn't have other futures that were tied into ours and we had a couple of of sad events too in a way. Well,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   we didn't have other futures that were tied into ours and we had a couple of of sad events too in a way. Well,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   we didn't have other futures that were tied into ours and we had a couple of of sad events too in a way. Well,

[00:06:44.460 --> 00:07:02.760]   Anyway, that that that was something that we saw that was, you know, had the potential to affect the quality of a of a traditional retirement. Right. You know, we could get to 65 years old and maybe, you know, I mean, we wouldn't be able to go anywhere or do anything. I mean, we, you know, it could be very limited.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.860]   And also Susan's mother had developed early onset Alzheimer's. Okay. And so and that was in her late 50. Right.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.200]   So,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.000]   you know,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.200]   the,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.400]   it,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.480]   so we could see,
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:44.500]  ,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   you know,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   in a close family sort of view of Susan's parents who had were, you know, her dad was in the process of retiring her mother was needing additional care and they were really looking at a retirement that was going to be extremely limited for a couple of people that love to travel and Susan's mother was very, very much of an activist in her days and and yeah so I mean it was kind of a combination of those things that I think it was a combination of those things that I think it was an excellent job.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.540]   I think all.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.220]   I think all kind of pointed us towards let's do things differently.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:08:14.520]   Right. Right. If I had met you say six months into that trip and you were just starting to feel like we're just getting started and we might want to change something. Would you have guessed or even imagined that you'd be on the road for another 17 years now? No, no, I don't think so. Yeah, I mean, it's it's like I said it was it was very much of a of a base.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's like I said it was it was very much of a of a base.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's like I said it was it was very much of a of a base.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's like I said it was it was very much of a of a base.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:44.540]   and so it really wasn't until we had a couple of years where we were able to do that.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's like I said it was it was a couple of years where we were able to do that.

[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:44.820]   all the safety equipment that we bought for the boat was really expensive and had to be inspected.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   So every year, and we weren't really confident enough with relying on those.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   So every year, and we weren't really confident enough with relying on those.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   I mean, when you're out in the ocean and you've got bad weather and various different kinds of issues, the last thing you're thinking about is, I want to sit down at my computer.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   Right, right.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   So we had paper charts and we spend a couple of thousand dollars a year, right? Just on paper charts. Because you have to have
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   a couple of thousand dollars a year, right? Just on paper charts. Because you have to have a couple of thousand dollars a year, right? Just on paper charts.
