[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.600]   The topic of today's deep dive is a question.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.440]   What would you say you do here?
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.320]   Now this is a quote that comes from Mike Judge's 1999 satire movie, Office Space.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.520]   And I use this quote in a recent article that I published in the New Yorker.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   Now the column I have been writing for the New Yorker is actually called Office Space.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.760]   So partially I want to just pat myself on the back.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.960]   Six articles into this column, I finally found a way to work an Office Space
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.400]   reference into my Office Space column.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.520]   But there is obviously a deeper meaning underneath that quote that I was trying
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.760]   to unpack in that column, and I want to spend some time talking about it here.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.760]   So the point of the article was revisiting Tim Ferriss' classic
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   2007 book, The Four-Hour Workweek.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.920]   And I told the story that I don't think has been told that often about how
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.040]   that book debuted to the world.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.840]   It debuted to the world at South by SouthWeth Interactive in 2007.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520]   After a last minute cancellation, the organizer of that event, Hugh Forrest,
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   found a room for Tim to come to give a talk about his book that was just about
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.920]   to come out, the conference was in March, the book came out in early April.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.440]   And he got up on this stage in this makeshift room into a capacity crowd
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.680]   that was full of people, was the argument I make in the article, it was full of
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.440]   people who were the epitome of the 10X programmer, hardcore, move fast and break
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   stuff Silicon Valley culture of that first decade of the 2000s.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   These were people that said, you get after it because you might become a
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.640]   decamillionaire when your startup gets sold, when you go to your IPO.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.760]   This was a time and a place where work ethic really trumped all.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.200]   You stay up late, you drink Soylent so you don't waste time with meals.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.920]   It's a hardworking group of people.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.640]   Tim got up in front of them and said, essentially, you work too much.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.080]   This isn't sustainable.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480]   Give up on this type of career and do something more
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.440]   interesting with your time.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.080]   That is what that speech was.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.000]   I went back and listened to the audio of the speech.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   I remember it from 2007.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   I went back and listened to the audio of that speech.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.800]   It was all about, this is completely unsustainable, this hard, hard
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.240]   charging, 12 hours a day, check email all the time.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.000]   You should have many retirements.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.520]   You should re redefine what work even means in your life.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.000]   You should heavily automate things.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.040]   You should take these startups and make them into lifestyle businesses.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.640]   It was a radical talk and this audience of hard charging tech types loved it.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.440]   The tech bloggers there in the crowd wrote about Tim, that put them on
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.920]   the radar of bigger tech luminaries.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.320]   They started talking about Tim, that put him on the radar of major media.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.120]   They began writing about Tim.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   The book debuted on the New York Times bestseller list where it basically stayed
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.240]   more or less for the next four and a half years, it went on to sell millions of copies.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.960]   It was mentioned in 2011 in the NBC show, The Office.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.160]   Darrell actually looks through the camera at one point and says, four hour work week.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   So it was a really big event, a cultural milestone that these overworked,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.760]   stressed out workers embraced this message of maybe we should rethink work.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   The question I then asked in that column is how come we don't hear more
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   about the four hour work week today?
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.760]   Right now in this period of post pandemic reconsideration of work, this period of
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.720]   what is known as the great resignation, which more and more knowledge workers
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.080]   are leaving their jobs or rethinking what role work should play in their life.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.000]   In some sense, four hour work week should be the manual for this movement.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.440]   If you go back and reread this book, Tim nails the reality that remote work is
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   going to be the key to a much more fulfilling and autonomous
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   mode of pursuing your career.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.800]   He nails the reality that excessive email and meetings is going to be the main
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.440]   obstacle to your work and your life being much more fulfilling.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.160]   I mean, this is a book that is getting at exactly the questions
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.600]   people are asking today, but you don't hear about it that much.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   Now, why is that?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.560]   And I should say, of course, it sells strongly.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.280]   I'm just saying when I've been reporting for The New Yorker on the great
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.080]   resignation and people rethinking their work over the last year or year and a
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.280]   half, this book doesn't come up as much.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.040]   And what I said in the piece is that this is in part because over time,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.920]   Tim and his message got transformed.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.280]   The book was radical.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   Tim got changed in the mind of the media, in the mind of the culture, into
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.760]   something that was much less radical.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.120]   He got changed into a productivity guru.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.160]   And you can go back here and watch this happen.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   By the time Daryl Philbin holds up, or he doesn't hold up the book, we fact
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.080]   checked that, but by the time he says four hour work week on an episode of
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.800]   The Office, the plot line was that he was trying to get more work done so that he
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   could get promoted to a more grueling management position.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.040]   That is the opposite of what the four hour work week was about.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   But by the time we got to 2011, the writers of The Office didn't know that.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.400]   They thought about that book and Tim as being vaguely speaking all about
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   optimization and productivity and trying to get more done.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.640]   There's a couple of reasons why this shift happened.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.040]   I mean, some of it is completely rational because Tim did go on to do quite a bit
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.800]   of writing about optimization and productivity.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.280]   What he explained to me when I talked to him for this article is that his
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   overriding interest during this period was minimum effective doses for any type
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.640]   of goal, and when you applied that to work, it led to this radical rejection
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.240]   of the standard career path and the working 12 hour days till you retire at
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.720]   65, but when you apply this mindset to other topics, like health and fitness,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   which he did in his second book, it comes across as more pragmatic.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.920]   You know, how do we rethink our diet?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.600]   What are more aggressive ways to exercise?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.080]   So partially his writing turned more pragmatic, but I put out another hint in
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.200]   this piece that also partially, maybe as a culture, we weren't ready for the
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.280]   radical message that was embedded in that book.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.800]   Tim was looking at this world in which we were getting increasingly busy and
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.400]   saying, "Most of this stuff is probably nonsense."
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.520]   Probably most of what you do could be reduced to a few hours a week and your
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.400]   impact on your organization might be more or less unaffected.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   He was implicitly asking of the entire culture that question that came out of
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.040]   office space, that question, "What would you say you do here?"
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.960]   A question that was actually asked in a scene where you had a pair of efficiency
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:00.160]   consultants interviewing a cubicle dweller at this corporate park, office
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.360]   park, and they were trying to figure out what this guy's actual job was.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.480]   And he was struggling to actually come up with a good explanation for what he
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.200]   actually did.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.080]   And in exasperation, one of the consultants asked that question.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.960]   In exasperation, one of the consultants finally said, "Well, what would you say
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.320]   you actually do here?"
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.080]   Tim was asking this of a whole culture.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.040]   I don't think we were ready for that question back then.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.960]   As I say in the piece, this period after the first dot-com bust in 2001 up until
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   the recession in 2009 was a period where busyness worked.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   Frenetic energy worked.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.400]   We were buying mortgages and packaging them up into these collateralized debt
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.000]   obligations that no one really understood.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.680]   And suddenly we had BlackBerrys and we were answering a volume of messages that
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.200]   no one ever really requested or said was a good idea, but we were just doing stuff
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.960]   and making money and seeing our stock portfolios rise.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.920]   Cash was plentiful.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.160]   It was not an environment where people wanted to step back and say, "Is what I'm
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   doing actually useful?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   Why am I on my BlackBerry all day?
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.120]   Why am I in all these meetings?
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   What exactly do I do here?"
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.880]   So I think there was almost a cultural immune response to Tim Ferriss in the
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.680]   four-hour workweek.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.760]   We can't face that question.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.040]   So let's turn Tim into a productivity guru.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.680]   And then we can raise our noses and say, "Look at this hack stuff.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   That's beneath me."
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.960]   And we were avoiding the question.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.280]   Today we can't avoid it.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.320]   What happened to all these knowledge workers who maybe avoided the radical
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   provocations of the four-hour workweek in 2007?
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.440]   They were unavoidably confronted with them in 2020 and 2021.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.600]   When we were forced to go remote and work from home and suddenly we had all these
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.120]   new things we had to figure out, so the amount of Zoom meetings skyrocketed, the
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.320]   amount of email skyrocketed, the amount of Slack skyrocketed, we had people
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.880]   discover that they were spending 80 to 90 percent of their day in meetings and
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.600]   doing email.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   And yet somehow their job still worked.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.000]   The company still did what it was supposed to do.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   The product still went out the door.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   They were working, actually working, a really small fraction of the day.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.520]   There was someone who tweeted in response to my New Yorker piece that says, "Yeah,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   I know about the four-hour workweek.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.480]   That's about how many hours of work I could get done having to work from home
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.760]   with my kids' school closed."
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   And yet these jobs still worked.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.720]   And now I think an entire sector of the economy is facing the same question.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.480]   Well, what would you say you actually do here?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.720]   And they're looking at themselves and they're looking at their jobs and they're
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.240]   saying, "Not as much as I probably imagined.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.040]   We're communicating, we're in meetings, we're in email, we're in Slack.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   Is the hyperactive hive mind supercharged?"
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   But the pandemic started to teach us most of that is probably performative.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.120]   Most of that is probably overhead.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.680]   Tim Ferriss reduced what it required to run his company from 18-hour days to
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.840]   four hours a week, and it seemed to run just fine.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.000]   And I think there's more and more people out there who are finally ready for that
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.160]   provocative question that he asked.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.720]   They're looking at their own lives and saying, "Something like that might be
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.600]   right for me too."
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.920]   So that is why I wrote about the 4-Hour Workweek 15 years later, because I
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.520]   think Tim was ahead of his time.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.360]   It was a big deal, a warning shot that that crowd took to that message.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.280]   We ignored the warning shot.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.880]   Now the rest of the salvo has arrived and we can no longer ignore that.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.440]   We are all looking around and asking, "What would you say you do here?"
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I don't think we have any more a good answer.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   A good answer.
