[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The metaphor that I love is Michelangelo
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.980]   would look at a block of marble, and he would say,
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.480]   the sculpture is already inside.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.120]   I just need to chisel away the layers that are in its way.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.280]   And I think dharma operates in very much the same way.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.920]   I can almost guarantee for you and me
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.400]   and anybody who's listening right now,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.360]   there is an essence that you've already been in touch
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.760]   with at some point in time.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.880]   It could have been when you were a little kid.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.100]   It could have been last week.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.480]   But you've had brushes, incidents with this essence.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.680]   It may be buried under deadlines,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.200]   under drop-offs, under all the other things
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.800]   we have going on in our lives.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.440]   And we can start to kind of chisel away those layers.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.600]   One of the ways that we can do that is through good questions
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.480]   to kind of come back to who we are.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120]   One of the questions that I love the most
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.960]   is, what would you do for free?
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.360]   If compensation was not a factor,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.400]   what is it that you would want to spend your time
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   doing anyway?
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.600]   If you can clearly answer that question,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200]   now you're starting to get closer
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.240]   to this thing inside of you that wants to express itself,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   no matter how the outside world reacts.
