[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Pastor John, I have a leadership question for you, and it's really a foundational
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.440]   question. Broadly speaking, how do you define leadership? What does godly
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   leadership look like, and what does godly leadership aim to achieve? I would define
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.520]   leadership as acting and speaking so as to create a following toward a goal.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.280]   That'd be the most generic way I could think of doing it, which of course is
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.120]   morally neutral. I haven't said anything about what makes it Christian or godly,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.600]   but that's what it would be wherever you talk about it. It seems like how you act
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.880]   and how you speak so as to create a following toward a goal. Then what makes
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.520]   that Christian, it seems like, what makes it godly or biblical is the goal is
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   defined by Scripture. You want to take people, move people toward godliness,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.440]   towards worship, towards honoring Jesus, towards loving people. And secondly, what
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.840]   makes it Christian would be that you care that the following be every people
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.200]   and tongue and tribe and nation. In other words, you're not prejudicial. You don't
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.960]   want to just get behind you the really cool people. That would be an ungodly
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.400]   leadership. You say, "I want to lead people, but the only people I want behind me,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   following me, are people who are so rich or so famous or so cool that they reflect
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.480]   well upon me in that way." You don't have that attitude at all. You want the people
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.840]   following you to be of all kinds of people without that kind of prejudicial,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   partial bent. And the third thing, it seems like, would be that the things you
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.280]   do, you know, when I say acting and speaking to get a following to go to a
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   goal, well those kinds of actings and that kind of speaking is going to have a
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.360]   certain flavor to it if we're being guided by the Scripture so that we'll be,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.960]   what Jesus said, "All the nations are trying to get people to bow to their
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.360]   authority and yield to them, and you should not be like that, but he who would
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   be great among you must be the servant of all." So this leadership is
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   going to have a servant quality about it, a humble quality about it. It's going to
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.160]   be trying to get under people and lift them up to something good as their
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.880]   servant rather than getting over people and oppressing and manipulating and
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.840]   using them to accomplish your private ends. So it seems like those three
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.960]   things, the goal, the breadth of the following, the humility, and the
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.840]   servant quality of the acting, takes this definition and makes it Christian. And
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.280]   the assumption in all that is all those are being defined by the Bible. It seems
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.680]   like in our culture there's an animosity towards leadership because leadership is
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.880]   agenda-driven, and it seems the self-giving nature of leadership is
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.280]   really a key element. Any thoughts on that? Yeah, totally. I agree exactly.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.760]   For example, this pro-life things are on my mind these days, and when we
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.480]   tried to lead people to be engaged in the pro-life movement more actively on
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.240]   the ground, it was clear that the more humble, the more readiness to suffer, the
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   more caring, the more empathetic that leadership was, the more authentic it was,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.440]   the more ready to follow. But if it was strident and forceful and mean-spirited,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.080]   then people said, "Okay, I don't want anything to do with that," and that's
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.960]   right. So I think Jesus dictated for us not only what is God-honoring but what
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   is effective when people really are looking for authentic leadership.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.800]   They're not looking for people who are on an ego trip who want to have a big
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.920]   following because it keeps their ego satisfied; he's looking for people who
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   have been satisfied by Jesus, he's their identity, and they want others to enjoy
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.000]   that, and to that end they're willing to get down low, they're willing to be
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.120]   patient, they're willing to wait, they're willing to serve, and people can smell
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   that, and they really do love it. They're ready, I think, to get behind
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.000]   somebody like that. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
