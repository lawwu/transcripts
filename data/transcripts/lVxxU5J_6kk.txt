[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   - What if there were more to wealth than just money?
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.900]   Don't believe me?
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.200]   Then ask yourself.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Would you trade lives with Warren Buffett?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   He is worth $130 billion.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   He is 95 years old.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.920]   There's no way you would trade the amount of time
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.960]   he has left for the amount of time you have,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.720]   even for $130 billion.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.640]   - Today with my friend, Sahil Bloom,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880]   we're gonna explore the five types of wealth,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.800]   time, social, mental, physical, and financial,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.840]   and how balancing all of them can lead
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.640]   to a life of true fulfillment.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   We'll share practical strategies for building your wealth
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.240]   by regaining control of your time,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.740]   strengthening your relationships,
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.500]   enhancing your mental clarity,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.300]   and investing in your health,
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.520]   all while building your financial freedom.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.840]   Whether you're starting fresh or looking to level up,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.560]   I really think you'll like this one.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins.

[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.940]   So I think so many people have an idea
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.060]   of what time wealth is.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.560]   And I know the last time you were on the show,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.940]   we looked at some charts about how much time you spend
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.120]   and how it changes for different people.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   What are the key factors of time wealth?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.000]   - The general consensus, standard, societal,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.560]   cultural definition of wealth has always just been money.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.000]   And in my view, it's really because money is so measurable.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.200]   Like Peter Drucker, the management theorist says,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.180]   "What gets measured gets managed."
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240]   And the reality is a feature of money
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.380]   is that it is so measurable.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.200]   You can place a single number next to your name
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000]   and determine your entire life worth.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.560]   Unfortunately, while money is useful as a tool
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.300]   for a whole lot of things in our life,
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.440]   it is not the singular thing that contributes
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.180]   to a life of meaning and a life of fulfillment and happiness.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.460]   There are many other things.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920]   That is really what this book is about.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.880]   The five types of wealth, financial wealth being one of them.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.640]   So I am very much not saying that money doesn't matter
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.080]   and that you should go live off in the Himalayas,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.660]   meditating 12 hours a day and drinking warm broth.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.580]   If you want to, by all means, go do that.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.680]   I just won't be joining you.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.280]   But it is a life built around these other four things
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.120]   in addition to money.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   And those other four are time wealth, social wealth,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.120]   mental wealth, and physical wealth.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.880]   We can talk through each of the five
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.600]   if it's useful as a framing and can go from there.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.840]   - And do any of these types of wealth
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.640]   have more or less impact than others?
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.960]   Or is there a reason that time wealth is first?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.120]   - Time wealth is fundamentally, I think,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.100]   of about two things.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.400]   It is about one, your awareness
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.540]   of the impermanent, finite nature of your time,
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.360]   of the fact that time is your most precious asset,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.520]   a true awareness of that fact.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.280]   And then it is about your control of that time,
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.240]   your ability to actually control
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.320]   your calendar and priorities on a actual functional basis,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.680]   your ability to take that time
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   and invest it into things that you want.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   So if you choose to invest it in working 100 hours a week
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.880]   on things that are really meaningful to you,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.920]   that is great and that is your choice.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.360]   Or if you choose to sit around on a beach in Bali and relax,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.680]   that is also your choice.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.540]   But the ability to actually control your time
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.020]   is the kind of second piece
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.460]   that is really important with time wealth.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.500]   - And what are some of the ways
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.940]   that someone can actually become more aware
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.420]   of that finite nature of time?
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.300]   - I think the first thing that people need to do
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.220]   is simply ask themselves a set of questions
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.620]   around time as an asset,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.540]   questions that sort of frame up the fact
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.840]   that time is a valuable asset in their life
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.960]   and one that is terrifyingly finite and impermanent.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.320]   So each section of the book
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.840]   is framed around one big question.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.640]   The big question in time wealth is,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   how many moments do you have remaining
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   with the people you love?
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.280]   And we talked about this last time
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.520]   in the context of those charts.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.280]   These short windows of time
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   during which these people occupy your life,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   they are very finite.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.160]   And we don't think about that enough in the moment.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.360]   We think about it at the end once it's too late.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.460]   Time has this funny nature where for most people,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.060]   you think about it not at all until the very end
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.700]   when it's the only thing you think about,
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.540]   but then it's too late.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.980]   You can't do anything about it.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.500]   So asking yourself those questions in the present
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.140]   along the way is the path to actually developing
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.300]   more awareness about that time,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.080]   about the fact that it is finite.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.780]   The other question I love to ask people,
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.580]   young people in particular, that frames this up is,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.140]   would you trade lives with Warren Buffett?
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.980]   He is worth $130 billion.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   He has access to anyone in the world.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.300]   He reads and learns for a living.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.540]   He flies around on private jets
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.060]   and has a bunch of fancy houses,
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.940]   but you wouldn't trade lives with him
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.980]   simply because he is 95 years old.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.740]   There's no way you would trade the amount of time
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.780]   he has left for the amount of time you have,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.620]   even for $130 billion.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.580]   And on the flip side, he would give anything to be your age.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.700]   He would trade all 130 billion to be in your shoes
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.860]   and to have the amount of time that you have left.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.740]   So we know by asking ourselves something like that,
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.300]   that our time has incalculable value.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.660]   Now we need to act in the present to recognize that,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.440]   actually take actions to center and to focus our time
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.300]   and energy on the things that we truly care about,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.420]   on the things that matter,
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.820]   that drive us forward towards our goals.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.020]   So I went through this exercise.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.260]   We'll talk about how people can kind of calibrate themselves
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.300]   on all these, which there's a tool you guys have built
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.140]   to be able to say, where am I on this?
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.020]   And time wealth was one that was interesting.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.300]   I think where I struggle is on the control side.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.980]   It's like, it's very easy to know that time is finite,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.500]   but I don't feel in control of that time.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.020]   And I imagine a lot of people who spend their day
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.820]   doing a job maybe they don't love
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.860]   or just have taken on too much,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.660]   which I think is often my case is,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.060]   it's not that I don't love what I'm doing,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   but I might take on 25 projects
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.460]   and then realize I didn't leave enough moments for family
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.900]   or friends in the week.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.760]   How do you think about that side of it
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.140]   and how people can kind of take control?
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.020]   - Yeah, you have different domains of your life
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.780]   and your degrees of control
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.680]   across different domains will vary, right?
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.420]   If I'm working a nine to five job and I have bosses
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.980]   and people that I need to be responsive to,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.940]   I may have less control, especially early in my career.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.540]   As I rise through the ranks within that,
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.180]   I'll probably develop more control.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.220]   In your personal life, you have more control.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.180]   You may have responsibilities and things
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.020]   that you have to do,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.480]   but you typically have more control over what you say yes
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.180]   and what you say no to in your personal life
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.340]   than you do your professional life.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.020]   The point is that you need to actually understand
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.820]   that control, that that freedom is the goal.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.580]   You can't lose sight of that because along the way,
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.880]   you can then be taking actions to say no to the things
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.960]   that probably aren't actually moving the needle
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.800]   in your life.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.500]   What most of us do is we do this thing of saying yes
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.620]   to things in the future because we don't think
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.740]   they're ever really gonna come.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.060]   It's called the yes damn effect.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.680]   Something comes your way, you say yes to it
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.700]   under the premise that you are going to have more time
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.540]   for it in the future.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.560]   So someone invites you to something two months from now
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.840]   and you say yes, then the thing comes and you're like,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.120]   damn, I can't believe I have to go do this thing.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.960]   And so we fill our time, we make ourselves endlessly busy,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240]   but we don't have enough time to focus on the real things
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.560]   that are going to vault us forward,
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.200]   that are going to progressively change the level
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.240]   that we're on, the 10x, 100x outcomes.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.120]   Learning to say no more effectively is a great way
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.220]   to start taking more control over your time.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.660]   Learning to recognize energy creators
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.780]   versus energy drainers in your life,
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.460]   meaning the things that are truly creating energy
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.940]   on a daily basis, those are typically the things
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.940]   that are actually driving the greatest output.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.500]   Those are the things that you're leaning into,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.900]   the things that are actually creating real value
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.780]   versus energy drainers, the things that are just
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.180]   pulling down your energy, that are hurting you, as it were.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.220]   Learning to identify between the two and in the book,
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.200]   there's an exercise called the energy calendar
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.700]   for actually sketching that out in your life.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.180]   You can start to make slow methodical shifts
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.100]   over periods of time to start taking more control
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.300]   over your time so that you can push yourself forward.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.380]   - Are there any other activities or kind of things
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.040]   you can do that are kind of the most important ways
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.340]   to impact your time?
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.780]   - Developing an actual awareness of the two to three things
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.500]   that are truly your priorities within your personal
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.280]   and then within your professional spheres,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.820]   I would say is the first exercise we all need to do.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.220]   Like most of us, if you ask us to list out our priorities,
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.460]   we'll list 20 things.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.300]   And the reality is if you have 20 priorities,
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.380]   you have zero priorities.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.700]   Because you cannot be prioritizing 20 different things.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.620]   That's just not the way that life works.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.300]   If you had to choose two to three things
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.860]   that you were gonna work on that you thought
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.580]   were gonna truly move you forward,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.760]   what would those two to three things be?
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.860]   And limit yourself, create a true forced constraint
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.640]   that you can only focus on these two to three things.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.140]   It was like Tim Ferriss back in the day
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.540]   with the four hour work week, had the idea of like,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.500]   if you could only work for two hours for the entire week,
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.740]   what would you work on?
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.060]   And it's a silly, crazy question to ask for most people.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.920]   But the crazy question forces you to figure out
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.300]   what is the thing that would actually allow me
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.340]   to get all of this done,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.420]   that would actually allow me to move forward?
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.540]   Asking those kinds of questions really does help
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.180]   in figuring out what are the things
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.640]   that are really moving the needle?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.420]   And what are the things that are just movement?
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.340]   Like the rocking horse phenomenon.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.360]   A whole lot of movement,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.340]   not a lot of actually going anywhere.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.820]   This episode is brought to you by Kick.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.100]   If you're anything like me,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.420]   bookkeeping is one of those things
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.680]   that you know you need to stay on top of,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.780]   but it always ends up last on the list
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.580]   until tax season hits and it is a scramble.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.220]   With deadlines coming up fast,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.900]   now is the time to get ahead of it.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.220]   So you need to check out Kick.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.540]   It's the best bookkeeping software I've found
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.860]   that actually does the work for you.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.420]   Seriously, it's so good.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.300]   No more spreadsheets, no more QuickBooks headaches,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.460]   just clean books for your business on autopilot.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.380]   And the setup is so easy, like 10 minutes easy.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.580]   You will love it.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.740]   I've been working with the Kick team for a while now,
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.460]   first as a customer, providing lots of feedback,
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.540]   then as an investor,
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.340]   because I really believe in what they're building.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.980]   And since tax season is coming up,
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.460]   I asked them to put together something special for you.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.020]   So if you sign up at chrishutchens.com/kick,

[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.300]   for this amazing deal.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.940]   So for me, time wealth was one
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.860]   where I felt like I was lower than the others.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.020]   And I'm curious if one of them
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.580]   is more important than the other,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.220]   or if there are ultimate things,
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.180]   whether it's happiness or something else
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.800]   that they each impact,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.640]   that some have outsized impact on.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.100]   So they all contribute
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.060]   to a life of fulfillment and happiness.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.660]   They are not ever going to be equal for anyone, right?
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.260]   Like all of our priorities are different.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260]   The things that we truly care about are different.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.660]   Time wealth is at the heart of all of them.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.340]   And it is the first section for a reason in the book,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.340]   because time is what unlocks you
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.160]   to invest in any of these areas.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.940]   When you create time wealth,
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.900]   when you create an ability to choose
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.340]   how you spend your time,
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.540]   that is what allows you to then allocate that time
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.940]   into the things you really care about.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.940]   So if you have that freedom
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.180]   and you have the control over your priorities,
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.300]   you could invest it into building relationships,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.180]   social wealth.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.220]   You could invest it into working on your purpose,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.380]   to working on growth, mental wealth.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.820]   You could invest it into physical pursuits,
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.660]   physical wealth.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.900]   You could invest it into financial wealth,
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.220]   into investing, into building things.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.660]   And so the point is that time wealth unlocks
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.540]   several of the others,
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.900]   and so it sort of runs alongside all of them.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.060]   But then the ones that you choose for your life,
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.580]   it doesn't matter what I choose.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.220]   It doesn't matter what Chris chooses.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.300]   What matters is what you care about.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.600]   And what you focus on or prioritize
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.940]   during any one season of your life will change.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.120]   So when you're in your 20s and 30s,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.820]   it is a great time to focus on and prioritize
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.540]   building a base of financial wealth
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.800]   that you can compound for the rest of your life.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.500]   But in your 30s and 40s, when your kids are young,
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.820]   you may want to set some of those things on autopilot
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.700]   and step back and really be present with your kids.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.660]   Focus on social wealth during that window of your life.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.700]   Then when they're grown up and they're back,
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.580]   you may wanna lean back in heavily into your purpose,
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.380]   into working on building financial wealth,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.820]   building a business, doing those kinds of things.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.020]   The point is that the seasons of your life come and go,
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.580]   and how you think about balancing these different things
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.000]   and prioritizing and focusing on them will change.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.620]   But along the whole journey,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.760]   you cannot turn off any one area.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.020]   The traditional school of thought on all of these things
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.580]   has been this like on-off switch methodology.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.060]   I fundamentally think that is broken.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.200]   All of these areas of your life exist on dimmer switches.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.300]   And when you turn one way up, that's great,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.620]   you're gonna focus on one.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.840]   You cannot turn the others off.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.460]   You can have them turn down,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.660]   which means they're more in maintenance mode,
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.540]   but you still need to invest a little bit in them
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.780]   to compound it to the future.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.740]   You still need to send the text to the friend
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.160]   to let them know you're thinking about them.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.320]   You still need to go for the 30-minute walk
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.380]   to make sure your health is moving forward.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.860]   You still need to find the five minutes of space
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.980]   and stillness to make sure your brain
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.180]   and your mind is sound and sharp.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.460]   Those tiny little investments compound
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.360]   as well as any financial investment,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.800]   but you need to think of it that way along that journey.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.840]   Okay, so that's time wealth.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.000]   That's why it was first, why it's important.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.120]   It's the one I'm focused on right now,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.080]   but let's talk about social wealth.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   Social wealth is all about your depth
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.720]   and breadth of connection to the people around you,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.660]   both your kind of inner circle of like true deep,
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.440]   what I call darkest hour friends,
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.340]   and then the broader circles of sort of looser connections,
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.060]   your broader connection to communities
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.260]   that extend beyond yourself, spiritual communities,
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.740]   local, regional communities, et cetera.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.420]   And then social wealth is also about
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.620]   how you interact with others around wealth,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.300]   the idea of status and how it plays into your life.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.980]   Building social wealth is fundamentally
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.140]   what allows you to enjoy any of the other types of wealth.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.020]   No one dreams of having a private jet and being alone.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.220]   No one wants to have a whole ton of money
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.640]   and no one to dote upon,
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.400]   no one to create experiences with.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   Building social wealth is fundamentally at the core
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.000]   of living a happy, healthy, wealthy existence.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.540]   There is scientific evidence
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.640]   that the strength of your relationships
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.320]   is the single greatest predictor
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.200]   of your health as you age over time.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.760]   The Harvard study of adult development
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.480]   followed the lives of 2000 plus people over 85 plus years.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   They found that the single greatest predictor
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.920]   of physical health at age 80
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.960]   was relationship satisfaction at age 50.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.840]   It was more impactful than whether they smoked or drank,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.180]   their blood pressure, cholesterol,
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.160]   how you felt about your relationships
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.380]   was the single greatest predictor of your healthy aging.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.380]   So we know these things are important,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.140]   and yet most of us will not invest in relationships
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.540]   in the same way we will invest
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.160]   in making more and more money.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   We need to change that.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.100]   We need to flip the script.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.700]   It needs to be just as important.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.900]   It needs to be that same daily investment
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.380]   that you think about compounding into the future.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.340]   - And do you think a lot of this change over time
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.060]   comes from what really happens in our lives
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.900]   when we have kids?
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.140]   We both have young kids.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.180]   I feel like our entire social life has completely switched
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.340]   where now I'm like, where is the time to go out with friends?
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.740]   Where's the time to go on trips
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.900]   to go see people at events and that kind of stuff?
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.780]   Because you've got kids, there's lots of demands.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.620]   You value sleeping more.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.420]   You have to spend more time on your physical wealth
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.860]   than you probably did in your 20s.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.580]   How do you think outside of your immediate family,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.920]   your social wealth should be prioritized,
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   and how do you do that in a world post-kids?
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.720]   - Yeah, I tend to think that life follows
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.280]   these natural sort of like ballooning phases
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.160]   where you kind of come in and then you balloon back out,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.980]   you come back in and then balloon back out,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.020]   depending on the different phases.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.100]   When you're young, you're very much expanding that balloon
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   of your social networks, the people you're meeting.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.660]   In your 20s, your early career years,
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.840]   you're building these networks,
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   you're building these relationships
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.060]   that are going to kind of continue to grow
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.300]   over the course of your life.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.100]   But then as you have kids, you sort of narrow that a bit
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.500]   as you focus in on those really,
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.100]   really important core relationships.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.940]   And then as they get older,
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.300]   I think it starts to expand again.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.960]   I see my parents now expanding
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.460]   and spreading their wings again.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.060]   Look, I think that fundamentally,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.500]   the separation between depth and breadth
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.100]   that I articulate in the book is the important point here.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.220]   You have your few core relationships,
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.820]   they're truly deep relationships.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.380]   People that will truly be there for you
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.380]   across different seasons.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.280]   From each kind of season of life,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.020]   I tend to think you get a few people
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.220]   that you end up carrying with you
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.300]   for the entirety of this journey that you're on.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.860]   You pick up a few people along the way.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.860]   You have the earliest ones,
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.780]   which are your parents and your siblings maybe,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.420]   and then you maybe pick up a partner
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.060]   who's gonna be there and maybe a few friends
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.180]   at each phase of life.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.140]   That is your depth.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.420]   Those are the people that you can call
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.060]   at three in the morning when you have a problem
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.900]   and they'll show up for you.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.980]   The people that are there for you during your darkest hour.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.580]   Then you have breadth,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.620]   which that is what sort of creates this fluctuating nature.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.500]   If you have time to invest in these broader social networks
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.780]   or professional networks or spiritual networks, you will.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.180]   And that creates this incredible texture
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.820]   and kind of reach to something
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.100]   that extends beyond yourself.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.500]   This feeling of connection to something
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.620]   that is bigger than you,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.480]   that is bigger than your local network.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.220]   But that is not a necessity for happiness
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.660]   or fulfillment in the moment.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.540]   Having those few deep, meaningful relationships
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.980]   that you can call upon during times of need,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.860]   that is really what fights off the feeling of loneliness.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.220]   But when you are sort of during one of those growth phases,
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.540]   when you have the flexibility to invest in it,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.020]   building upon that broader network of connections
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.140]   is a really meaningful pursuit.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.940]   - And have you thought about processes
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.540]   or ways that you could kind of map this out
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.700]   to see where you're at?
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.580]   - Yeah, I mean, the quiz that we talked about
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.660]   has a good approach for kind of thinking about
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.980]   where you are today.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.620]   In the book, I also lay out
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.660]   something I call a relationship map,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.340]   which is sort of a two by two matrix
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.020]   for all my nerds out there.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.100]   Mapping your existing kind of relationship ecosystem
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.020]   and thinking about where people exist on this map
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.300]   of the frequency of your contact with them
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.100]   from infrequent to frequent
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.740]   and the health of that relationship
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.560]   from sort of toxic to very supportive.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.300]   And it gives you a visual perspective
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.860]   on what are the relationships
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.780]   that I really wanna be leaning into
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.900]   and what are the relationships
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.860]   that I should be leaning away from
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.460]   in order to live a happier life?
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.140]   - Yeah, one thing I've been playing with,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.660]   and I'll probably do an entire episode
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.020]   after I finish the playing phase,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.780]   is there's a couple of apps
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.940]   that attempt to map out all of your relationships.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.740]   Clay is one, Dex is one.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.460]   I'm open to others if you have them.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.980]   And I've been going through them
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.700]   trying to understand how I could use them
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.940]   to better tackle this aspect of wealth.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.580]   And one of the things I did,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.660]   which is separate from those,
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.500]   is I have like a contact list on my iPhone
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.940]   that's basically called like walking calls.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.740]   And anytime I'm just, I don't have anything to do,
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.460]   I'm going on a walk, I just go into this.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.220]   And there's like 30 people there
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.100]   that I like mentally wanna make sure
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.260]   that I stay in touch with.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.180]   I just scroll through it.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.580]   I'm like, "When's the last time I talked to this person?"
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.260]   I think technology will get even better at like,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.100]   "Hey, it's been six months since you talked to this person.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.460]   "Maybe you should reach out."
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.300]   But any other tactics you have for kind of staying in touch
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.220]   or kind of prioritizing people?
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.060]   I have a silly one.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.540]   So I love all these tools, the personal CRMs.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.380]   I haven't seen Dex before, but I've seen Clay.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.460]   I always run the balance and the tension that I feel
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.100]   is between making this feel natural and real
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.180]   and sort of like systematizing it and optimizing it
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.500]   to the point where it no longer feels
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.980]   like a genuine relationship.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.580]   Like I am not big on the word networking
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.900]   because it feels transactional to me, it feels fake.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.460]   When what I really wanna do is build genuine connection,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.900]   I want to give with no expectation of return.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.380]   So I wanna find something in a way to operationalize
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.300]   these things in my life that feels natural.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   One of the funny ways that I've done that
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.340]   is by using Apple's sort of like memories
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.420]   or like for you feature with pictures.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.940]   So every single week,
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.660]   I'll pop into my like iPhone photo feature
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.940]   where it pops up memories from your phone
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.620]   over the last several years.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.260]   And I have a practice where when there's a picture
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.980]   with someone, I text it to them.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.380]   I just send it to them and say like,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.620]   "Oh, good times," or something like that.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.580]   It 100% of the time ends up sparking
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.260]   a quick catch-up interaction with someone
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.380]   that I likely haven't spoken to or connected with in a while.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.180]   And it's just like a simple trigger
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.940]   that reminds me to do that, to reach out to the person
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.100]   because it's so easy and it's so accessible
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.180]   and it's sitting right there.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.620]   And I have found that to be just like an awesome practice,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.820]   very simple way of building social wealth
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.100]   and keeping in touch with these people
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.620]   that you've clearly created cool memories with in your life.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.340]   Yeah, I mean, mine is probably less millennial or Gen Z.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.620]   I literally just call people and half the times you're like,
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.420]   "Why is someone calling me?"
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.100]   Random phone call, but I don't know.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.940]   I just find I'm like,
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.420]   "Hey, I just haven't talked to you in a while."
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.220]   Yeah, it's like taking some of the idle minutes
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.300]   that you have.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   Sometimes I find myself just driving
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.980]   and I just call someone, do the same thing
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.260]   or like send a voice note,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.940]   something little where you let someone know
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.340]   that you were thinking about them.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.660]   And again, to the point of like investing in these areas
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.180]   the same way as financial wealth,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.340]   that compounds into the future.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.220]   Like that person, you were building a relationship.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.580]   You were like putting a penny in the jar
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.220]   that's going to compound and stack up
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.620]   over a longer period of time.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.780]   Is there something you think most people are getting wrong
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.620]   or making mistakes when it comes to building social wealth
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.300]   beyond what you said about
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.500]   focusing on transactional networking?
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.740]   The thing people get wrong
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.860]   is thinking that more is better with social wealth.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.980]   The tendency is to say like,
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.940]   "Well, it's because money like more is better
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.260]   is the mindset people have had."
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.980]   And everyone's wired differently around this.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.740]   One person might feel lonely
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.860]   if they have only a hundred friends.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.220]   Another person might feel lonely
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.660]   as long if they only have one friend.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.660]   Like what social wealth means to different people
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.500]   will be different
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.900]   because you have a natural level of introversion
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   or extroversion and you need to figure out
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.500]   what level of connection fills your cup.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.980]   It doesn't matter if it's the same.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.860]   I am more extroverted than my wife.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.260]   My wife really just needs her like very close network
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.100]   of a few friends and family
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.980]   to feel extraordinarily socially wealthy.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.940]   I need a bigger group of people.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.980]   Like I need to feel like I can reach out
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.540]   to different people who have expertise
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.540]   on different things and problems that I'm facing.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.100]   And that's what makes me feel good,
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.580]   but it's different for all of us.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.100]   So figuring out your sort of natural set point
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.260]   or baseline, if you will,
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.820]   that you're kind of working towards is important.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.300]   And then last, it wouldn't be all the hacks
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.140]   if I didn't ask you.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.340]   You've got 31 social wealth hacks.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.820]   Any favorites that you wanna drop here?
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.620]   And then obviously people can go read all of them
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.180]   in the book.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.020]   Let's see.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.500]   I have this anti-networking guide in the book,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.780]   which is this idea of like
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.940]   how to build genuine relationships.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.620]   And in there, I share this whole idea
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.180]   of finding value aligned rooms.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.300]   What I mean by that is people often complain
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.980]   that it's hard to make friends as adults.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.180]   You're like, "Well, when I was in school,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.100]   "it was easy to make friends.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.420]   "And now as an adult, I don't know how to do that."
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.860]   The idea that I have here is
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.020]   you know your kind of core set of values.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.860]   Map them out.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.500]   Things you care about, things you're interested in,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   things that are exciting to you.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.100]   Find rooms that self-select for other people
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.100]   that have that similar set of interests or values.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.940]   So if I'm really into health,
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.740]   a room that has a lot of people interested in health
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.340]   is like a farmer's market.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.140]   That's a great place where I could go
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.740]   and have cool conversations with people
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.500]   that are interested in similar things to me.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.420]   The gym, another example of that.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.660]   If I'm really into dogs, I'm really into animals,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.620]   going to a dog park is a great example
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.860]   of getting into a place like that.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.180]   If I love the arts, going to art gallery openings
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.340]   or going to book clubs in your local community,
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.620]   going to museum openings,
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.300]   those kind of things are going to place you into situations
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   where you are highly likely to meet other people
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.540]   that are excited about similar things to you.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.420]   That is how you make friends as an adult.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.740]   But you need to think about it that way.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.860]   You need to like play the game on easy mode a little bit
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.820]   when it comes to finding those people.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.460]   - This episode is brought to you by Superhuman.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.140]   Now I've used Superhuman for years
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.020]   and I think it's hands down the best way to do email,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.860]   assuming you value your time,
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.980]   which I absolutely assume you do.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.940]   That's because Superhuman is the ultimate solution
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.980]   for inbox decluttering and enhanced productivity.

[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.660]   And I'm certain I've saved dozens,
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.020]   if not hundreds of hours a year using Superhuman.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.300]   They have every feature you could ever want built in,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.820]   split inboxes for prioritizing what matters,
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.900]   keyboard shortcuts and snippets for everything.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.860]   AI tools to draft responses and summarize emails,
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.500]   automated reminders and integrated calendars.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.020]   And if you're using Superhuman for Teams,
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.300]   you get shared conversations and drafts
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.060]   that will help you respond faster and reduce deal cycles.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.420]   Best of all, Superhuman works

[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.180]   I have learned so much about everything
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.740]   from communication to leadership to negotiation
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.940]   from business experts on this show.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.660]   But if you're like me, you are always hungry for more.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.820]   And that's when I turned to Masterclass.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.540]   It's the only streaming platform
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.700]   where you can learn and grow

[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   I've leveled up my investing with Ray Dalio,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.180]   perfected pizza making with Tony Gimignani,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.380]   and picked up so many great business lessons
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.700]   from Howard Schultz, Rosalind Brewer, Bob Iger,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.860]   and so many more, all through Masterclass.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.180]   But recently, I wanted to set up some great habits for 2025.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.380]   And I took James Clear's class on habits,
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.780]   and it was so helpful.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.300]   And it's not just me that loves it.

[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.780]   One of my favorites was just this obvious thing.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.980]   Say exactly what you mean.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.900]   No one, not even your family, can read your mind.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.740]   And it's something that I feel like I need to repeat
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.340]   because there are so many times in life
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.500]   where you're with people,
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.860]   and you're just assuming they know what you're thinking.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.300]   And it's just so easy to just tell them.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.940]   And if anyone has friends from cultures
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.700]   where people are way more direct,
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.060]   I have a couple of friends from Israel
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.180]   where it's like every single time,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.740]   they just tell you exactly what they're thinking.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.860]   I'm like, "Oh, isn't this nice?"
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.060]   And then sometimes we play these guessing games
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.380]   in the States where it's like,
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.180]   "Let's see if someone can figure out what I really want."
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.660]   - Yeah, I mean, the other one is just
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.780]   never avoid hard conversations with people you care about.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.300]   When you avoid a hard conversation,
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.180]   you're just taking on a debt
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.660]   that has to be repaid with interest
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.220]   at a date in the future.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.820]   Time doesn't heal anything when it comes to relationships.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.340]   It just makes things worse.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.740]   So if you have to have a hard conversation, have it now.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.860]   Don't delay having that for the future.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.700]   - I love that.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.900]   Okay, and delaying it can cause a lot of mental stress.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.580]   So let's talk about mental wealth.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.420]   - Yeah, so mental wealth is about a few things.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.060]   Mental wealth is about your purpose.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.460]   It's about engaging in growth,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.420]   growth as a human being, growth of the mind.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.620]   And then it's about creating space, creating stillness,
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.140]   creating an ability to wrestle
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.980]   with the bigger questions in life,
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.140]   these unanswerable questions that we face.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.780]   Mental wealth is such an interesting one
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.460]   because it's a story and a kind of arc
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.700]   that we can all relate to, which is the hero's journey,
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.220]   which we've seen throughout history.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.540]   And it's something that we all connect to.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.700]   It's the reason it's such a popular movie arc
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.020]   or television show arc
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.180]   is because we all see ourselves in that story arc.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.380]   It's like the pursuit of some core purpose,
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.740]   some sacred duty that you go off into pursue
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.660]   and you face trials and tribulations
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.580]   and experience growth from that journey
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.740]   only to see yourself change as part of the process.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.620]   That is the journey we all find ourselves on.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.460]   But oftentimes we lose sight of that.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.020]   We get kind of stuck with the shiny object
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.340]   of trying to make money
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.300]   and we lose sight of this thing of curiosity,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.980]   of purpose, of growth,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.020]   of creating that stillness in our life.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.380]   And so finding ways to cultivate mental wealth
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.580]   on a daily basis,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.380]   tiny investments that you can be making
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.420]   to allow yourself that space,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.300]   to search for that purpose, to pursue your curiosity,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.500]   to engage in growth-oriented activities,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.820]   to have a growth mindset,
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.140]   that really cultivates a life of abundant mental wealth.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.260]   - I think one of the biggest criticisms
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.940]   or follow-ups to conversations like the one we just had
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.460]   or what you've just said
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.380]   is talking to people who are like,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.820]   "I just don't know what the thing is.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.540]   Even if I had the time to spend on it,
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.260]   I haven't found that purpose,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.660]   that thing that I love doing."
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.260]   What advice do you have for those people?
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.340]   - The idea that your work has to be your purpose
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.380]   is one of the worst lies you've been told.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.660]   Purpose has been hijacked by hustle culture.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.540]   And basically, you've been told
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.060]   that if you don't find your purpose in your work,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.380]   you are lost and you're hopeless.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.460]   And that's not really true.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.980]   If you do find purpose in your work,
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.780]   that's great and I'm really happy for you.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.900]   But the reality is that most people won't.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.740]   Most people, the best case
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.100]   and what you should work towards
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.780]   is a world where you have a higher order purpose
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.380]   for this season of your life,
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.260]   and you are able to connect to that while you are at work.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.060]   It doesn't need to be the same thing,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.220]   but you can connect to it.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.500]   I'll give you an example.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.940]   During the research process for the book,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.180]   I had a conversation with a man who works at a factory
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.860]   and he basically assembles widgets
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   for eight to 10 hours a day, like on an assembly line.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.840]   He doesn't like his work at all, right?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.500]   Like he's doing a manual task,
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.780]   very monotonous over and over again.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.460]   But every single day when he goes to work,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.780]   he connects to a higher order purpose,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.980]   which is to be the father that he didn't feel like he had,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.220]   to be a provider for his family.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.580]   So every day when he goes to work,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.740]   even while he's doing something
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.260]   that he doesn't intrinsically enjoy,
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.900]   that's not his purpose,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.380]   he's connecting it to the higher order purpose
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.460]   of what he's trying to do as a human being.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.700]   So he has energy for it.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.260]   He shows up with a good attitude for it
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.420]   because he knows it's in service of something much bigger.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.780]   We can all do that.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.420]   We can all identify what is that thing
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.820]   during this season of our life
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.680]   that is our higher order purpose.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.700]   Maybe it's providing for our family.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.820]   Maybe it's engaging with our love of the arts.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.740]   And we know that working in a job that pays the bills
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.140]   allows us to experience and appreciate the arts
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.780]   or to go travel to see history
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.260]   and historical artworks around the world.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.660]   So it doesn't have to be,
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.280]   oh, I don't love the thing that I'm doing in my work.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.740]   And so I'm lost.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.960]   I need to keep going on this endless search.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.140]   It might just be that your job is your job
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.620]   and it works in service
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.340]   of some higher order purpose in your life.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.260]   - I would also go one step further and say,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.180]   there are times where the job
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.340]   that feels like it's more aligned with your purpose
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.100]   might end up consuming your life to the point
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.600]   that it actually negates that purpose.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.260]   So I have, I'll say friend or family member
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.180]   to kind of leave it vague,
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.900]   but they've taken a path of like not pursuing a job
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.100]   that they necessarily love
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   or is aligned with what they care about most in the world
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.980]   because they're able to have a lot of free time after work
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.340]   where they're not consumed by thinking about work.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.180]   Whereas as you and I probably know,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.740]   when you're doing that thing that you love for work,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.100]   sometimes work consumes you.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.820]   Like you think about it nonstop all day.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.060]   And as much as I love what I do,
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.740]   I also wanna spend time with my kids.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.220]   And sometimes it's, they're at odds
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.540]   because the thing I'm doing for work,
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.260]   I love so much that it makes it hard to step away.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.460]   And I'm sometimes jealous of people
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.140]   who are just so easily able to step away from work,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.500]   not think about it on the weekends,
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.540]   not think about it at night.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.380]   And I'm not saying I would trade it,
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.660]   but there's definitely some benefit to that style of work.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.460]   - I have this conversation all the time with people.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.620]   So I love that you raised it,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:12.580]   which is this idea that ambition is a double-edged sword.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.060]   Extreme ambition can actually manifest as a curse at times
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   because you are constantly in the pursuit of some thing
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.700]   and you are unable to disconnect.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.100]   And so while it ends up creating some incredible outcomes,
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.620]   it also has a real cost.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.580]   Extreme ambition has a tax to be paid in your life
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.460]   from having that.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.260]   I often kind of muse on the fact of
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.780]   whether like there is an optimal,
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.620]   a Goldilocks amount of ambition where you like have enough
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.700]   that it's kind of pushing you to grow and do things,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.020]   but not so much that it's making you not appreciate
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.940]   the present moment and the present quality
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.180]   that you have in your life.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.580]   - We talked a lot about mental wealth.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.260]   Where do things like stress, anxiety, and burnout
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.980]   fall in the mental wealth framework?
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.460]   - All within this idea of creating space in your life.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.020]   So space is derived from this idea from Viktor Frankl,
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.320]   who said that basically your power exists in the space
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.340]   that you can create between stimulus and response.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.620]   Most of us live in this immediate sort of loop
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.620]   where stimulus is constantly coming in
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.320]   and response is constantly going out.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.200]   Everything's urgent,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.540]   you're constantly responding to things.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.660]   You have no space to slow down, to zoom out,
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.900]   to contemplate, to wrestle with questions
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.300]   internally, externally, with a higher power,
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   whatever it might be.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.380]   And that gets you into this endless loop of anxiety,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.020]   of stress, of poor mental health,
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.380]   deteriorating mental health,
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.700]   because you're not able to stop and pause
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.500]   and create that space to breathe.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.820]   Finding rituals to create that space
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.320]   is the way that we get out of that loop.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.460]   I also should mention,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.100]   the goal is not to eliminate stress from your life.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.420]   This is like a common misconception, right?
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.700]   The goal is to have meaningful stress,
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.220]   to have stress over things that actually matter,
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.500]   that you actually care about in life.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.100]   If you have stress because the thing that you're working on
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   is extremely meaningful to you,
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.740]   that is not bad stress.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.020]   That is not stress to be eliminated.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.620]   Stress to be eliminated is the stress over silly things
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.220]   that can be fixed very easily
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.060]   or that you don't need to worry about as much.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   That is, I think, a common misconception
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.180]   that we need to sort of rid ourselves of.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.180]   - Or I would say, if you're focused on something,
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.820]   you deeply care about it,
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.940]   but you let it get to a point
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.700]   that that stress is debilitating,
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.580]   that would probably also fall in the unhealthy camp.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.300]   - I would agree with that, yes.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.900]   - Yeah, I love that each one of these sections of wealth
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.260]   has a bunch of hacks in here,
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.260]   because one that I thought I hadn't heard anyone really say,
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.420]   which was about rereading books.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.660]   And so one of my favorites was just this concept of,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.860]   if there's a book that meaningfully affected your life,
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.360]   go reread it later,
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.100]   because it might completely be a different book.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.820]   I've experienced that as a podcast episode.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.340]   So I've gone back and listened to two-year-old episodes
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.780]   and been like, "Wow, I learned so much
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.660]   even though I'd already done this episode."
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.860]   But for some reason,
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.100]   I'd never really thought about doing it with books.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.940]   Any other kind of quick hits in that set of hacks
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.220]   that you share on mental wealth that you wanna drop here?
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.500]   - I think that's a good one.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.860]   One of my absolute favorites,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.060]   and this is a collaboration with Susan Cain,
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.140]   who's one of my favorite authors.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.380]   She wrote the book "Quiet."
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.940]   It's about introverts and their power
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.300]   in an extroverted world,
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.780]   is the secret to life
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.620]   is to put yourself in the right lighting.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   For some, it's a Broadway spotlight,
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.580]   for others, a lamplit desk.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.580]   Use your natural powers of persistence,
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.180]   concentration, and insight to do work you love
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.340]   and work that matters.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.200]   Solve problems, make art, think deeply.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.420]   - I like that.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.020]   Great, great, great ending.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.060]   And let's talk about physical wealth.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.660]   - My personal favorite.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.900]   No, physical wealth is all about your health and vitality.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.820]   It is about your physical health.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.260]   And we've heard the phrase, right?
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.620]   Health is wealth.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.580]   And it's very true.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.220]   The investments that you make in your physical health
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.780]   are going to compound in your life.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.960]   And physical wealth,
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.080]   because it is the most natural type,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.500]   i.e. it is part of your biology,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.020]   also is the most naturally entropic,
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   meaning whether or not you invest in it
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.120]   is going to deteriorate.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.380]   What your best hope is
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.500]   is that you slow the rate of that deterioration
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.120]   through daily actions that you take.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.780]   But through daily actions and daily disciplined investment,
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.680]   you can slow the rate of that decay
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.700]   so that you can enjoy more of your years
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.380]   so that you can have a great health span,
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.700]   as Peter Attia talks about.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.740]   And the question that I ask in the book to frame this up,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.540]   the big question is,
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.100]   will you be dancing at your 80th birthday party?
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.860]   If you imagine your 80th birthday
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.360]   and your family and friends all show up to celebrate you
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.340]   and the dance floor opens and your favorite song comes on,
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.120]   based on your current actions
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.060]   and the trajectory that it has you on,
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.660]   will you be able to get up
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.020]   and be on the dance floor dancing with your loved ones
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.740]   at your 80th birthday party?
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.580]   And if not--
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.580]   - And not the middle school sway dance, right?
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.420]   Like a really big-- - Not the sway,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.700]   like some serious dance.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.940]   Yeah, serious dance.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.140]   And if not,
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.700]   what actions do you need to start taking in the present
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.400]   to make sure that you are building towards a future
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.260]   where you are able to do that?
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.160]   And physical wealth really comes down
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.460]   to just these three pillars
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.760]   of movement, nutrition, and recovery.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.300]   Taking on the boring basic like level one
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.060]   within each of those gets you 80 to 90% of the benefit.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.100]   We're bombarded by the most complex,
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.060]   crazy regimens around physical wealth.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.680]   And it's because it's what gets clicks on social media.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.060]   The craziest stuff is what generates clicks,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.360]   when in reality, the most basic stuff is what works.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.940]   With movement, level one,
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.980]   just move your body for 30 minutes a day.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.820]   I don't care if you're walking, jogging, skiing, lifting,
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.940]   dancing, whatever you like, swimming, just move.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.580]   For nutrition, just eat whole unprocessed foods,
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.180]   80% of your meals.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.020]   If that's all you do,
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.940]   that is a great start in the nutrition bucket.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.340]   That's about 17 out of 21 meals in a week.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.120]   And then recovery, just sleep seven hours a night,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.960]   nothing else.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.260]   You don't need fancy blue light blockers.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.780]   You don't need sunlight in the morning.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.700]   You don't need any of those things.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.260]   If you do those three things,
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.640]   you're ahead of 90% of the population
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.340]   and you're going to be moving things forward.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.700]   You don't see those,
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.780]   that type of like boring basic wisdom espoused
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.940]   on the internet simply because it doesn't get clicks.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.960]   You can't sell that, right?
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.840]   Like I cannot sell you an ebook on building your health
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.260]   that just says, you know, move your body for 30 days,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.740]   eat whole unprocessed foods and sleep, right?
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.580]   It would be a very short ebook,
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.300]   not particularly interesting one, but it just works.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.900]   Like the boring basics, just plain work.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.320]   - And for people who have that dialed in
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.580]   and still maybe feel like physical wealth
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.260]   is an area they want to focus on,
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.900]   how do you think about the next step?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.540]   - So I lay it out in the book as sort of like a video game.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.700]   So you kind of have levels to physical wealth
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.660]   that you are going to graduate up.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.660]   So if you are already doing the boring basics,
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.740]   you graduate to level two and level three.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.220]   And you know, if you want to try to become Brian Johnson,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.540]   I'm sure there are way more, you know,
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.700]   detailed crazy levels above that.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.540]   I would think of level three as having a movement regimen
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.140]   that includes both cardiovascular training
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.300]   and resistance training, meaning weight training.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.280]   So you're kind of hitting all of the major buckets on that.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.220]   With your nutrition, I would think of it
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.380]   as the vast, vast majority of your calories
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.260]   are coming from single ingredient, whole unprocessed foods.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.460]   You're limiting alcohol, you're hydrating enough,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.420]   you're making sure you're getting
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   your micronutrients as well.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.180]   That's largely from supplementation
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.700]   because they don't occur naturally in your body.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.920]   And then with recovery, you're making sure
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.460]   you're getting eight hours of sleep a night.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.020]   And you're probably taking on a few other recovery methods,
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.560]   whether it's sauna or cold plunge, you know,
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.020]   red light therapy, some of these breathing protocols,
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.580]   other things that are helping you with your recovery.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.700]   That is sort of level three, where like beyond that,
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.260]   everything else is the last 1% of benefit.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.500]   If you're doing that,
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.420]   you are at the top of the chain already,
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.500]   and you're doing great.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.540]   - I didn't really ask this for each one.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.060]   So maybe we could do a quick recap.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.380]   Within each bucket, are there diagnostics
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.240]   that you look at?
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.480]   You know, when I think of health, I'm like,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.500]   okay, you could look at your sleep score.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.540]   How many hours of sleep you get is pretty straightforward.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.580]   You know, you could go all the way to VO2 max.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.540]   How do you think about level setting
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.520]   where you are within each area
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.420]   beyond kind of the questions you have?
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.980]   - I think the best diagnostic tool
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.940]   really is the wealth score quiz that we've laid out.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.620]   Because some of these in relation to like physical wealth,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.940]   there's very objective number metrics
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.780]   that you can put to it.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.220]   I think, you know, both financial wealth
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.460]   and physical wealth sort of have that.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.940]   With time wealth, with social wealth,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.820]   and with mental wealth,
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.220]   a big goal of the book was to put forward a way
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.100]   for you to sort of quantify these things
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.900]   that are previously unquantifiable.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.420]   And so you can put it in the show notes,
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.780]   but wealthscorequiz.com.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.340]   You can take the online assessment.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.460]   It's also in the book.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.240]   And it'll give you this visual
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.860]   that you can kind of use as your baseline
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.100]   to go and build against.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.340]   - This episode is brought to you by Delete.me.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.660]   And if you prefer not to have your identity stolen
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.860]   or have your phone number, home address, or email
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.340]   showing up all over the internet,
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.820]   you really need to check out Delete.me this year.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.420]   Unfortunately, there's hundreds of data brokers online
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.540]   that are constantly sharing and selling your personal info,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.620]   and keeping track of all of them is like playing whack-a-mole.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.500]   But fortunately, if you go to them one by one,
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.740]   you can get them to remove your data.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.260]   However, that process can take hours and hours
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.380]   to do yourself.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.740]   I know, I tried it two years ago,
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.980]   and after spending more than 10 hours
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.040]   and not even getting close to finishing,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.060]   I gave up and started using Delete.me,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.620]   and I haven't looked back.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.000]   Since then, I've signed up my entire family,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.580]   because Delete.me will not just find
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.100]   and remove your personal info
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.180]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.420]   they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up,
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.460]   which sadly happens all the time,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   and get that removed as well.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.380]   On average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.500]   of personal info for a customer in their first two years,
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.020]   and to date, they've done over 100 million
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.980]   data removals for customers.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.740]   So if you want your personal information
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.540]   removed from the web, go to chrishutchins.com/deleteme,
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.180]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.

[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.500]   This episode is brought to you by Facet.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.980]   Finding good and actionable financial advice is not easy,
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.920]   especially if you want it to come from someone
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.060]   who's acting in your best interest.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.340]   So let me save you some time,
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.500]   because when I shut down my financial planning firm
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.040]   a few years ago, we did a ton of research
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.820]   on who to recommend to our clients,
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.580]   and we landed on Facet.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.780]   Facet makes professional financial advice
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.300]   actionable to everyone, and instead of charging
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.060]   a high percentage of your assets,
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.980]   they only charge a flat annual membership fee
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.280]   with investment management included.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.100]   With Facet, you'll get access to a team
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.820]   of CFP professionals and specialists,
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.960]   providing guidance across retirement planning,
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.940]   tax strategy, estate planning, and more.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.300]   So head on over to chrishutchins.com/facet,
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.060]   F-A-C-E-T, to learn more about which membership option
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.300]   is best for you.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.860]   That's chrishutchins.com/facet.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.380]   All right, the one that we all know, financial wealth.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.240]   How do you approach this, given that it's the thing
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.380]   we by all default think of as wealth?
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.180]   So the articulation that is really important in the book,
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.020]   and in my own perspective on financial wealth,
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.020]   is that it is all about defining what enough means to you.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.400]   Defining clearly what your enough life looks like.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.580]   And the reason that's so important is because
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:38.980]   expectations are your single greatest financial liability.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.360]   If your expectations rise faster than your assets,
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.980]   you will never feel rich, you will never feel wealthy,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.340]   you'll just keep chasing whatever more you've propped up
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.860]   as the place where your happiness lies.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.060]   And that fundamentally comes down to having
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.200]   a clear definition of what it means
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.220]   to have enough financially.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.340]   What that life actually looks like to you.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.140]   Not a number, but more where you are.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.100]   What you're doing, where you live, how you feel.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.380]   You know, the amount of money you have in the bank account
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.540]   maybe factors into it, but it's much more about
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.180]   what the entire life picture looks like
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.140]   when you feel you have enough.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.420]   And the whole goal there is to make it
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.140]   a clear image in your mind.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.020]   So that when it naturally starts to increase and move up,
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.740]   which will happen because you're human,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.560]   it's human biology, the hedonic treadmill.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.480]   When that happens, it needs to be a conscious
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.640]   and rational upward movement,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.120]   rather than a subconscious irrational one,
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.240]   which is the standard for all humans.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.560]   So we need to frame that, we need to understand
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.940]   what that enough means financially,
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.160]   so that we can start to actually make that upward movement
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.960]   a clear conscious one.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   And what are the key factors that promote financial wealth?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.280]   You know this, I'm a big fan of deconstructing
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.540]   complex things to like the most simple,
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.580]   boring version that exists.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.940]   And when you think about the path
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.340]   to building financial wealth,
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.540]   there is really only one model that works,
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.660]   no matter what you see out there in the world.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.420]   Every single person that has accumulated
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.220]   and built financial wealth has done some version
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.820]   of these three things, which is,
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.940]   they've grown their income, and that is cash inflows.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.660]   That could come from primary employment,
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.180]   secondary employment, side hustles,
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.160]   or like windfall events from selling things.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.980]   They've managed expenses, meaning their cash outflows.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.340]   They've managed those over time
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.900]   to be below their cash inflows, which creates a gap,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.200]   a gap between the inflows and the outflows.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.700]   That gap is the single most important tool
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.860]   for building financial wealth,
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.620]   because you can take that gap and invest it,
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.100]   which is the third piece of this,
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.940]   into long-term compounders,
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.380]   into things that are going to compound value
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.460]   over long periods of time,
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.500]   whether that's boring basic things
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.020]   like stock market index funds,
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.460]   or whether that's fancier things
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.440]   like real estate investments, or crypto,
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.140]   or whatever it is that you're getting excited about.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.880]   But that model of growing income alongside your skills,
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   managing expenses so that you are living below your means
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.940]   and expanding and growing that gap,
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.820]   and then investing that gap into things that compound,
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.140]   fundamentally, that is all
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.780]   that building financial wealth comes down to.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.300]   - And do you think there's a place
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.480]   that's often overlooked or underlooked?
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.420]   - I think that most people focus a bit too much
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.860]   on the managing of expenses
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.980]   and a bit too little on the growing of the cash inflows.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   The reason that's important
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.420]   is because you can only cut your expenses to zero,
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.060]   but you can grow your income infinitely, effectively.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.940]   And so if you focus on the idea
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.060]   that income is a byproduct of value
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.540]   that you create for the world,
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.740]   value you create for others,
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.260]   you capture a portion of that value,
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.900]   that's how you make money.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.340]   If you can grow the amount of value you create
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.300]   by stacking and compounding your skills that you can offer,
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.320]   and then leveraging those skills,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.500]   you can make more and more money over periods of time,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.580]   both from primary employment and from secondary employment.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.900]   If you do that,
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.180]   and you manage your expenses to a rational level,
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.860]   you don't allow your expectations
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.740]   to run wild as you're growing,
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.820]   you will build a life of financial wealth,
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.460]   because you'll be able to just take those things,
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.940]   invest them into boring, basic stuff that compounds,
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.500]   and you'll create financial independence
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.860]   for yourself and your family.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.580]   - A different way to say something similar,
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.500]   which is that on the expense management side,
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.900]   where you started with defining enough
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.040]   is way more important than thinking about it
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.240]   from a cutting standpoint,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.080]   because naturally over time, your income goes up,
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.240]   whether that's from raises,
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.280]   or finding a partner and combining incomes,
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.520]   or just all the things that end up happening,
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.840]   most people end up making more money as they age,
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.160]   then they end up spending more money.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.640]   So it's a little bit of the management of expenses,
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.080]   but a lot more of level setting,
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.440]   here's what we want and not letting that creep happen.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.500]   And I think just going through how you spend money
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.740]   and having a conversation with yourself,
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.100]   or a partner if you have one,
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.780]   on do we spend more or less than we want to
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.540]   in this category of expenses?
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.100]   Like that conversation has led us to realize,
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.620]   oh, if we had more money to spend on travel,
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.660]   like I have no aspiration to fly private.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.300]   And we play the game well enough
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.820]   that like we don't need more money for that category.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.920]   So it's less about trying to find ways to save
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.180]   and trying to be comfortable with where we are,
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.760]   which makes it easy to not spend more
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.500]   when you generate more income.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.020]   - Yeah, I completely agree with that.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.080]   - And then on the investing side,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.020]   I think personally my investing strategy is pretty boring.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.380]   I'm in a bunch of, like you said, boring index funds.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.060]   And I think we talk so much about that
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.360]   for the same reason that all the crazy supplements
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.700]   and diets work on social media,
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.860]   because it's really boring to say,
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.300]   hey, you could just buy some index funds and be done.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.840]   Like it's way cooler to talk about
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.760]   the crazy things people do
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.000]   than it is to talk about the other categories,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.920]   which are like managing your own impulses financially,
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.760]   which is actually the thing
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.080]   that really clickbaits on social media.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.400]   - Yeah, I completely agree with that.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.800]   It's like the complexity trap,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.520]   especially with smart people.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.520]   Smart people are attracted to the complex, sexy solutions.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.200]   And so what ends up happening
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.080]   is that we naturally want to do the complex thing
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.860]   because we know it'll be more interesting to other people
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.500]   when we go and talk about it.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.700]   - Funny enough, I think the financial wealth section,
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.180]   which is what most people might think of as wealth,
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.380]   is the one we spent the least amount of time on.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.620]   And I wanna go back to how we talked about diagnostics
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.700]   and measuring your wealth.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.100]   So wealthscorequiz.com and the book
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.860]   both have the tool you've built.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.340]   Talk a little bit about what it is.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.380]   And then I want you to share the tip you gave me
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.700]   about a way to do it if you're in a relationship.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   - So the quiz itself is broken into the five types of wealth.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.200]   So for each of the five types of wealth,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.240]   there are five statements.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.240]   And you respond to the statement
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.260]   from strongly disagree to strongly agree
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.480]   on the basis of how you feel that statement aligns with you.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.600]   And it totals your score across all of these.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.840]   So for every strongly disagree is a zero,
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.280]   every strongly agree is a four.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.320]   So each of the areas ends up being 20 total points,
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.560]   which adds up to 100 across the five areas.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.900]   And it gives you a picture
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.780]   when you spit out your final visual here
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.540]   across these different areas of wealth in this circle.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.700]   And it kind of fills in the chart in the different areas
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.260]   on the basis of how you're doing.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.500]   It's a great baseline assessment,
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.300]   especially starting your year out
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.980]   to get a sense for where you stand today
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.140]   so that you can build against it.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.300]   When I first created it in 2021
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.100]   was when I was making my big life change personally.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.780]   I was at a 53 and now I've worked my way up to an 87,
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.700]   I believe the last time I did it.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.820]   It's totally personal.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.980]   The way that you answer it is sort of up to you
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.020]   and how harsh or critical you are on yourself
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.040]   is going to impact it.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.660]   So it's a personal scoring system
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.300]   that you wanna measure yourself against
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.040]   over long periods of time.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.220]   What you mentioned about an interesting way to do it
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.060]   is if you're in a relationship, do one for yourself
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.700]   and then do the same assessment for your partner.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.380]   And each, you do one for each other.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.900]   And then look at it and see how you stack up.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.300]   Basically like how did you rank yourself
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.140]   and then how did your partner rank you
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:08.220]   and have a discussion about why they ranked you differently
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.360]   than you ranked yourself.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.780]   Because it often reveals interesting things about yourself,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.540]   sort of like doing a 360 review on your life,
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.860]   but with your partner.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:20.900]   My wife is more critical and probably more honest
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.420]   about some of these areas.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.860]   So I found her score was like 10 points lower
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.220]   for both of us than mine was for each of us.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.780]   And then we talked about it and I was like,
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.820]   I'm probably playing this optimist role
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.740]   where I'm like, yeah, I do have control over my time.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.580]   And she's like, yeah,
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.180]   but you're not using it the way you want to.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.700]   We had this dialogue and it was super helpful.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.460]   So I would encourage everyone to not only take it,
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.340]   but have someone else take it for them.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.020]   Ideally, someone that knows you really well.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.460]   And if you don't have a partner, maybe it's a best friend
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.980]   and then talk about it.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.540]   And it spun off so many interesting conversations.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.620]   For the nerds, we put it in a little two by two matrix
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.400]   so we could kind of compare it all on one sheet
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.140]   just to go full circle there.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.200]   I love that for you.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.460]   And how do you think about what to do with that?
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:06.460]   So for us, there were two or three areas to focus on.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:10.060]   Earlier, you said you can't focus on all of them
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.140]   and you can't focus on any of them, zero.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.020]   How many of them do you need to focus on?
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.860]   And how many of them do you even have to be
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.380]   kind of near capacity?
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.700]   Can you live a fulfilling life with a 60?
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.620]   - It's totally up to you.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.820]   And if you're feeling deeply fulfilled and you're at a 60,
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.860]   I think that's great.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.980]   My guess is you are not feeling deeply fulfilled
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.700]   if you answer at a 60 and you feel like there's improvement.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:32.880]   If you're listening to this podcast,
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.620]   you are a growth-oriented individual.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.580]   Having a score and seeing what this looks like,
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.140]   you are going to want to improve on the areas that are weak.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.220]   The book, each section has a guide at the end
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.620]   that is filled with tips, tricks, hacks,
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.540]   science-backed strategies for building
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.860]   that type of wealth in your life.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.340]   So you can go and read it and actually take action
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.700]   on something today to start building that type of wealth.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.300]   They are the exact strategies that I've used in my own life
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.460]   to dramatically improve my sort of comprehensive wealth
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.940]   score across these areas.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.740]   They are what people have used across all walks of life
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.580]   to do that.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.460]   So they are proven, they're timeless, and they work.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.060]   But just getting your baseline, having that awareness,
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.900]   and then starting to slowly take action
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.140]   to build against that,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.700]   that is the path to creating change in any area of life.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.220]   You measure what matters,
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.120]   and then you build and take action against that
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.380]   to build the future that you actually want for yourself.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.620]   - And if someone does this and is like,
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.000]   "Gosh, I'm lower than I want to be in four areas,"
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.340]   do you suggest tackling one at a time, two at a time,
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.660]   all of them?
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.340]   - I think you should take a tiny action in all of them,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.900]   and then ask yourself which is the one
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.280]   that you're really focusing on.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.140]   Wait, like if you are in a place where you're like,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.900]   "Oh man, I really want to focus on my physical wealth,"
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.260]   then you can prioritize that
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.420]   and lean into that one more heavily,
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.580]   but still take one tiny action on the others.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:46.140]   I mean, the tiny action on social wealth
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.180]   could be as simple as sending one text a day
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.660]   to someone that you care about.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.980]   The tiny action on physical wealth
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.780]   could be going for a 15-minute walk every single day.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.260]   The tiny action on mental wealth
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.980]   could be taking five-minute breaks
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.220]   to just breathe in between meetings.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.060]   There are simple tiny actions you can do
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.620]   that will improve that type of wealth today.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.720]   Like it doesn't need to be, it's a month-long activity,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.060]   it's a year-long thing, it's literally today,
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.520]   but you have to do the tiny action.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.540]   So creating the awareness, know where you're deficient,
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.140]   and then invest a little bit to start building that area.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.960]   - I love it.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.580]   And what do you think the difference for someone
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.420]   who has identified this, gone through this process,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.480]   and really cared about it,
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.700]   someone who has five types of wealth
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.840]   instead of thinking about it from just one,
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.100]   what do you think the difference in the life
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.580]   that that person will live is?
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.620]   - It's dramatic.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.300]   I mean, you will see the world
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.500]   in an entirely different light.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.520]   You'll be able to measure the things that actually matter.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.540]   You will make decisions with the bigger picture of your life
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.460]   in the clear view.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.540]   So when you make a decision,
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.300]   rather than it being just about financial wealth
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.140]   and just about money,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.220]   you'll be able to see all of these different areas
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.120]   because you understand how they play a role in your life.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.760]   And then you'll be able to design your life proactively
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.040]   along these pillars
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.080]   so that when you're making those future-oriented decisions,
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.800]   so that when you're designing where you wanna be
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.840]   in five, 10, 15, 20 years,
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.320]   you're taking into account this broader picture
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.800]   of your entire life rather than just the singular one.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.360]   - We've talked about this book since, you know,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.020]   before you, I think, started even writing about it.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.800]   I'm so excited that you put it together.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.000]   I only got the digital copy,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.760]   so I'm still waiting for my physical copy.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.900]   But by the time this comes out,
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.740]   I think it'll be here in the mail.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.100]   I think we actually talked about you maybe coming on
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.420]   for the members and doing a little something.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.900]   So for anyone who's an All The Hacks member, stay tuned.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.740]   - I can't wait.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.560]   I can't wait to do it.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.540]   And looking forward to seeing what actions people take
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.620]   on the back of this.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.500]   - Yeah, and you didn't say it,
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.620]   but you can find the book wherever books are sold.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.620]   Did you do an audio book and did you read it?
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.140]   - I read the audio book myself,
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.140]   which was an absolute grind, by the way.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.180]   The audio book process is crazy
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.000]   and can't wait for people to listen to that one as well.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.840]   - Awesome.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.080]   All the links in the show notes.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.360]   Thanks so much for being here.
