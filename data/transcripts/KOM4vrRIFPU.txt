[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.300]   - Good Monday morning everyone,
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.620]   and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.900]   Pastor John, we have over 50 questions now piling up
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.780]   and waiting patiently for us in the inbox,
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.420]   all on cigarette smoking, vaping, and nicotine addiction.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.380]   Topics not addressed on APJ to this point.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.460]   Our questions include things like this.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.160]   Is cigarette smoking a sin?
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.220]   Is smoking a deliberate sin, a willful sin,
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.940]   like what we read about in Hebrews 10.26?
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.900]   Is it sinful for someone to smoke indoors,
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.720]   thereby endangering the health of non-smokers inside a home?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.160]   And of course, several emails from parents
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.680]   watching their teens get addicted to nicotine by vapes.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.180]   Should they be concerned?
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.540]   There's a lot to cover.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.860]   In our first venture into these sort of intertwined themes,
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.060]   what thoughts come to your mind?
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.300]   - The US Food and Drug Administration
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.620]   has been requiring health warnings
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.260]   on cigarette packages since 1969.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260]   As of May 2021, there are 11 approved warnings.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.780]   Here's six of them.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.820]   I just got them off the FDA website.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780]   Smoking causes head and neck cancer.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.780]   Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in non-smokers.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.380]   Smoking causes cataracts, which can lead to blindness.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.940]   Smoking causes bladder cancer.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.140]   Smoking causes type 2 diabetes.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.660]   Smoking during pregnancy stunts fetal growth.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.100]   So it's not a debate anymore
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.500]   whether nicotine is a harmful drug
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.700]   and whether smoking causes numerous diseases.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.580]   And that includes nicotine in cigarettes, cigars,
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.980]   e-cigarettes, or vaping, and chewing tobacco.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.060]   Nicotine is harmful.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.620]   Whatever form you choose to put it in your mouth
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.820]   or in your lungs.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.820]   The Bible is very clear that taking deadly risks
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.900]   is a noble and beautiful thing
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.340]   when you do it by entrusting your soul to Jesus
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.980]   and for the purpose of rescuing other people,
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.460]   especially people in eternal danger.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.380]   But the Bible has no praise
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.780]   for those who risk their lives or their health
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.020]   for private pleasure.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.820]   The Bible calls this a deceitful desire, Ephesians 4:22.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   It's a desire that promises one thing
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.660]   and then delivers another.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.460]   It's not rooted in or governed by a desire
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.460]   to show that Jesus is supremely desirable to us.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.340]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6, 19 to 20,
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.380]   "Do you not know that your body is a temple
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.380]   of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.060]   You are not your own.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.980]   You were bought with a price.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.060]   So glorify God in your body."
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.500]   So smokers need to ask,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.740]   is my decision to damage my body
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.420]   and probably others by smoking
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.060]   governed by a desire to make God look glorious
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.500]   with my body,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.740]   or does it merely make me look self-indulgent?
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.020]   So yes, parents should be concerned.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.500]   And yes, it is wrong to use a deadly drug
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.320]   to calm your nerves.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.540]   But let's do this.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.940]   Let's name seven steps
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.500]   from the first cigarette to the grave
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.860]   and see whether they fall short
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.300]   of biblical righteousness.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.980]   This might be something parents would walk through
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.100]   with their 13-year-old.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.220]   Step one, many people, especially younger people,
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.220]   take the first step into smoking because it's cool.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.300]   And when I say cool, I intend three elements in coolness,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.940]   a feeling of liberating independence from authority.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.140]   And that authority might be
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.140]   a fuddy-duddy, fundamentalist, blowhard podcaster like me,
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.660]   or it might be parents,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.580]   or it might be traditions that you've grown tired of.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.620]   Two, coolness includes the feeling
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.420]   that you now have an image of attractiveness
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.580]   for whatever reason.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.700]   And three, coolness generally includes
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.340]   a sense of belonging to a group that you admire.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.340]   So step one into smoking is often motivated
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.580]   by a strong impulse to be cool in these three senses.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.820]   Step two, the desire to be a part of a cool group
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.060]   provides the necessary psychological power
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.380]   to deny at the outset
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.540]   that you are damaging yourself or others.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.300]   Coolness empowers denial.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   Step three, after the initial nausea or coughing or dizziness,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.180]   if you get through that phase,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.060]   there is the nicotine buzz,
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.500]   which feels in the context of denial
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.660]   like a justifiable reward.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.900]   It feels good.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.540]   Step four, now comes the pull of the buzz.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.700]   And as it becomes stronger,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.180]   the desire passes from a chosen pleasure
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.300]   to the craving of a perceived need.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.380]   This is sometimes called addiction,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.540]   but I am usually hesitant to use that word
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.380]   because it creates the impression of helplessness.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.660]   When we all know that if someone puts a blowtorch
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.460]   in front of your face,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.340]   you will be able to put down the cigarette.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.940]   Step five, as one grows accustomed to the habit,
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.220]   there can easily grow a sense of indifference
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.820]   as to how it negatively affects others,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.980]   whether at home or in public.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.780]   Step six, after enough time passes,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.620]   then comes the negative health effect or effects.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.820]   Lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease,
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.580]   high blood pressure, eye problems.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.580]   The body eventually signals
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.220]   with the help of physical pain,
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.980]   the foolishness that we refuse to see
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.300]   in rational or moral argument.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.540]   Step seven, a death that may come earlier
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.180]   than it would have otherwise, or perhaps more painfully.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.020]   Now, it doesn't take a Bible scholar to see
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.860]   that each of these steps involves an inclination
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.220]   or inclinations and actions
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.700]   that are contrary to the spirit of Christ.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.140]   When the desire to be cool overcomes the call to wisdom
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.460]   and humility and freedom and self-control,
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.260]   coolness has become an idol.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.980]   It has become more precious than the way of Christ.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.020]   This is the main route that parents should address
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.020]   as soon as their children can talk.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.060]   What will be their treasure and their guide,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.020]   Christ or the crowd?
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.140]   The second step, the one that denies the harmfulness
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.380]   of nicotine is simply self-deception.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.900]   And the Bible calls us over and over again,
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.460]   not to be deceived.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.020]   You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.700]   The third step elevates the physical buzz
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.820]   above moral claims of wisdom and holiness.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.300]   When Peter said, "I urge you as sojourners and exiles
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.940]   to abstain from the passions of the flesh,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.380]   which wage war against your souls," 1 Peter 2:11,
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.900]   he meant that there are soul pleasures
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.380]   and soul commitments that should govern
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.380]   the desires of the body and keep us back from self-harm.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.980]   In the fourth step, we're falling into the bondage of a drug.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.620]   And Paul said, "All things are lawful for me.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.620]   I will not be enslaved by anything," 1 Corinthians 6:12.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.780]   In step six, as with most bad habits,
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.420]   they're not just a problem for us,
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.500]   but begin to be a problem for others.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.460]   And our indifference to that is simply a lack of love.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.800]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.340]   but also to the interests of others, Philippians 2, 4.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   Finally, death is appointed for everyone, yes,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.940]   hastening it by means of self-pleasure.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.420]   Hastening it by means of selfish pleasure
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.740]   is not submission to providence,
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.760]   but the failure to value a precious gift.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   So I would say to parents, from the earliest years,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.720]   with the prayer and a thoughtful use of the Bible,
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.960]   build into your children, one,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.040]   a freedom from the herd mentality of needing to be cool.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.440]   Two, a love of the truth.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   Three, a passion for self-control and self-denial
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   for the greater joys of righteousness.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.840]   Four, a deep commitment never to be enslaved
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.640]   by anything in this world.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   Five, a strong concern for the interests of others,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.720]   not just our own.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   Six, a proper stewardship of the gift of health and life.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.520]   And seven, a fearlessness in the face of death,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.320]   but a refusal to risk it for the sake of personal pleasure.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.840]   - That's a great little primer on nicotine.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.400]   And if you have a follow-up question on the topic,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.320]   mention this episode, episode number 1702,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.340]   and send it in to us.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.800]   You can ask that question or search our growing archive
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.000]   or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.840]   You can do all of that at our online home

[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.840]   - Well, we live in the age of tolerance,
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.920]   a season when the payment due for sin is forborn.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.240]   But that sin debt will be called in.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.280]   And when this season of tolerance is over,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.640]   the King of Kings, Jesus Christ, our Savior,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   will not be the king who rode into Jerusalem
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.920]   on a humble donkey.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.960]   No, the king will return on a white war horse.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.040]   And we need to look at that
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.760]   and the implications of this reality
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.360]   because it matters for all of us.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.520]   That's next time on Wednesday.
