[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hi, this question's from Danny, a postdoc from Texas.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I'm currently a postdoc.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I have heard many times from multiple people,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   if you ain't busy or looking tired,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   you're not doing it right.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I do not feel busy or tired.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   As a matter of fact, I really enjoy being a postdoc.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I've been implementing and following your theories
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   for a couple years now, which has helped.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   But as someone who is striving to get into academia
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   for teaching and research purposes,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I am nervous if I am going into a field
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   where if I'm not perceived by people
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   as being overwhelmed or drowning.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Yeah, this is common.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is common in academia, because here's the thing.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's a weird job to be a grad student,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   a postdoc, or an assistant professor,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   but especially a postdoc or a grad student.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's a weird job because it, unlike other jobs,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   doesn't have this diverse input of tasks and obligations
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   that you need to be working on all day long.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Your friends went to investment banks,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and they are working 10 hours a day,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and they have spreadsheets they have to fill out
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and emails they have to answer and meetings they have to go to
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and decks they have to update.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   That feels like work.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And then you're a postdoc or a grad student,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and your advisor is like, "Write a paper.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I'll see you at Christmas."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And it doesn't feel like work.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And so there's a tendency that people get worried.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   They get anxious about this,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and they want to invent busyness.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   They want to invent the same type of overload
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that they hear their friends at real jobs talking about
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   because at least they can tell themselves,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   "I'm not lazy. I'm working hard. I'm busy all the time.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So if this doesn't go well,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   it's not going to be because I just wasn't doing the work."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I think expansiveness and autonomy and schedules
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   can be very uncomfortable for people
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   if they're not used to it.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And so you get a lot of grad students and postdocs
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   who try to lean into finding pain points of busyness.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But here's the reality is that it's actually,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   with some exceptions,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   exceptions that typically involve lab work
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   is very time-consuming.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   These are easy jobs.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And I think it's okay.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I love being a grad student. I love being a postdoc.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   They're not super demanding jobs.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   As you become a professor, it gets more demanding
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   because there's other types of responsibilities
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   that are layered on, and then it becomes much harder to juggle.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   That's okay.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   They're not paying you that much money.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So it's okay that it's not,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   "I need to do nine hours a day of busy work."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   You are completely safe to sidestep that culture
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   of, "My hair is on fire, dissertation hell,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   everything is so hard, what a hard job,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm so overloaded, I'm so busy."
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's okay to say, "I'm working on one research paper,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and I give it three good hours a day,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and then I'm training for a marathon
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   because I don't really have a lot to do
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   on a lot of other days." That's okay.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That is a perfectly reasonable schedule for a postdoc.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What was I doing? When I was a postdoc,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I injected a lot of non-postdoc-related things
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   into my life because, A, it didn't take that much time,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and B, I knew as a professor I was going to have
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   a lot of other things to do, so I wanted to get used to
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   fitting the stuff I was doing as a postdoc,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   the research, which I would still have to do as a professor.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I was like, "I want to be really comfortable doing that
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   in a relatively small amount of time,"
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   because even though I could, as a postdoc,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   take the papers I'm working on and find a way
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   to take up my whole day with it,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I can't do that as a professor
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   because I'm going to have classes to teach
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and service obligations and family,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and I'm going to have way more distractions,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   so I better get good now at doing just this thing
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   that I'm tasked to do as a postdoc, research,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   doing this in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So I did a lot of other things. I wrote a book.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I was sculling. I was taking sculling classes
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   on the Charles through BU.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I would go for a long midday run and exercise.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'd run home across to Charles on the Mass Ave. Bridge
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   and then would exercise on one of the floating docks
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and would get lunch and watch a show
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and then take the subway back from Charles MGH to MIT
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and do a little bit more work in the afternoon.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I mean, I had huge breaks out of my day,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and that was all designed.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I was like, "I cannot let myself get into the mindset
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   of this work needs to take up the whole day
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   because everything is going to get
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   for real busier in the future,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and so if I make this fake busy,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   how am I going to handle that in the future?"
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So this is all to say you can ignore
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   that culture of busyness.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   If you have good organizational systems,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   it sounds like you do. You listen to my stuff,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and you don't have a really hard lab position
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   where you're overseeing seven grad students
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and a bunch of undergraduates as part of a giant NIH grant.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   If you don't have one of those situations,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   just lean into it. It's a pretty easy job,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and that's great because life will get harder soon enough,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and you can be fine with it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And as for the question of whether that's going to hurt
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   your academic trajectory, no one cares
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   or notices how you feel or how quickly you answer emails
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   or how busy you are.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   All that matters for that is what did you publish,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   how good was it, how many people cited it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   That is all that matters.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Some of the most famous academics in history
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   were basically misanthropes and did nothing,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   were pains, were lazy, were irresponsible.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It didn't matter. Papers are all that matter.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So just focus on doing your research well.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   No one is going to say, "We wanted to accept you,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and we love your work, and we love your papers,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   but we heard that you often don't work past five or whatever."
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   No one cares. Let's care about your papers.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So lean into it. Postdocs are a great job.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's a fake job, an awesome job. I miss it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You're okay not being busy.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Those really are easy jobs.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And they're not easy jobs, but they're hard
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   because of the autonomy, honestly.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I really do think it breaks a lot of people,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   especially at the elite school.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You go to a school like MIT or something,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   it's just, "Write some papers. Let me know how I can help."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It really is, "I'll check back in at the end of the semester."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And that can drown you, or it could be super exciting.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And some people are like, "This is great.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I'm writing papers and have all these hobbies and whatever."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And some people just, "I have to find a way
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   for this to be hard and for me to be busy."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And it's really clear. It's like binary.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You're either one or you're the other.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's a good job. The easiest jobs I've ever had.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   People always think I'm crazy when I say
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I wrote a book during my dissertation
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   because writing my dissertation did not take enough time.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I was like, "How long can I spend on this?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   What am I going to do? It's like two hours a day.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So let me write a book at the same time." Unrelated.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   My grad students love to hear that from me.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   [music]
