[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   How do I rebuild my life into something deeper?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.660]   All right, so I'm gonna load up on the screen here,
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.980]   my notes, I'm gonna draw.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.720]   So caveat emptor, Cal Newport's gonna try drawing.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.800]   This never ends up being that beautiful.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.360]   Be ready for it.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.880]   If you're listening and you wanna watch
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.400]   what I'm drawing on the screen, this is episode 252.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.440]   So go to youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.760]   and look for episode 252,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.520]   or go to thedeeplife.com and look for episode 252.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.540]   I'll also do my best to narrate what I'm drawing
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.980]   for those who are just listening.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.300]   All right, so what you'll see on the screen here
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.520]   is what I call the deep life stack.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.620]   Right now I have it empty.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.900]   We're gonna fill in the details as we go along.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.160]   The stack has four different levels to it.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.240]   I'll highlight those.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600]   You got level one, two, three, four.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.440]   The way I'm conceptualizing the deep life stack
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.020]   is sequential.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.720]   You start with developing the bottom layer of the stack.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.580]   Then you move up to the second layer,
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.760]   then the third, then the fourth,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.680]   and then we're gonna iterate,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.480]   and we'll get into that soon.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.280]   All right, so what happens on the first layer
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.300]   of the deep life stack?
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.600]   This is the first big change or breakthrough,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.080]   I would say, I've had when thinking
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.680]   about the deep life more recently.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.640]   What I'm gonna put at this bottom layer
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.680]   is gonna be discipline.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.480]   That's gonna mean two things.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.020]   But let me say what my goal is here.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.540]   I'm realizing when it comes to cultivating
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.000]   a different type of life, any type of transformation,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500]   you have to first change your self-identification
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.780]   to be the type of person who is able
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.620]   to persist with things that are difficult
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.620]   in the moment in pursuit of a greater good down the line.
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.980]   And I think it's very easy for people like me
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.580]   who give advice for a living,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.980]   who've been doing this for a long time,
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.240]   to take for granted that that's what we do already.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.080]   But this is actually for most people,
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.220]   maybe the most critical step is transitioning
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.760]   from someone who says, "Look, this is not me.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.160]   "I don't have discipline.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.240]   "I'm not really able to pursue goals
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520]   "unless I feel really excited about it in the moment."
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.540]   How do we shift that self-identity?
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.280]   And as longtime listeners of the show know,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.500]   I really do see discipline as an identity.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.180]   It is not something you do, it is an identity.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.600]   You see yourself as someone who is disciplined
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.620]   or you don't, that requires some cultivation.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.200]   So at the very bottom of the deep life stack,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.940]   and this is why I've highlighted this,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.440]   you would get started by putting some elements
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.400]   into your life that require discipline to accomplish.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.620]   And it doesn't really matter
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.140]   when we're first beginning here what these are.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.400]   You just wanna push them to be past what's trivial
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.600]   but still south of intractable.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   So where you're starting from might depend
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.360]   where how ambitious these initial bits of discipline are.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   So this is where you might say,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   "Look, I'm gonna train for a 5K.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520]   "I am going to read five books a month."
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.920]   You're trying to find something
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   that's gonna require some discipline.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.360]   I'm gonna overhaul my nutrition.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.680]   I'm gonna do something new.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.820]   I'm gonna do this workout routine,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.600]   try to hit a streak on Peloton, whatever it is.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.360]   You're calibrating it to where you are.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.120]   And I don't really care at first the content
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.560]   of these things you're pursuing with discipline.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.600]   This is identity formation.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   And that's where we get started.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.960]   You take a couple of things in your life.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   You say, "How can I make progress on this every day?"
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.120]   And if it's too hard, you find something easier
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.600]   until you can move up to something harder
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.280]   but you're establishing discipline.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.040]   The second piece here is you're going to establish
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   your route for everything we're about to do.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.120]   A directory, a folder, a drawer in a desk
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.460]   where it's gonna be the one place where you keep track
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.620]   of everything that you've committed to do in your life,
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.400]   your rules, your systems, your goals.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   So that you're going to initialize this route
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   to your ultimate life planning processes
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.240]   with these initial discipline projects.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.400]   So at the beginning, you could just have a folder
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000]   on your desktop, you could have a drawer
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.480]   where you're just writing down, here's my disciplines.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.720]   I'm working on these two things.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   Here's what I do every day towards them.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.640]   This is going to grow as we move through the deep life stack
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.080]   but you're establishing here in the discipline step.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.480]   Here's where I keep track of what I commit to.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.220]   And you're starting to practice having commitments
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.640]   that are about long-term value,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   not what you wanna do in the short term.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   So already we're a little bit different
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.200]   than standard thinking about lifestyle designs
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.480]   because we're not starting with the decisions.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.040]   We're not starting with the let's quit my job.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.020]   I wanna move to the country.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.280]   We're recognizing that there is some effacement
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.720]   that has to happen first.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.700]   There's some preparation that has to happen first.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.280]   We don't wanna jump into the decisions
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   till we've developed the self first.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.640]   So that's the first layer of the stack.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.320]   All right, so once that's going,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   I have a couple of things and I've impressed myself.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.040]   I'm doing these, I didn't think I could.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.640]   I am capable of discipline
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.360]   and I have a centralized place now
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.200]   to keep track of what I'm doing.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   We move on to the next layer.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   I'll write this in here.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.700]   We'll call this values.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.760]   All right, so yet we're not yet the choosing
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   to quit your job.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.800]   We're not yet the moving.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   Values is where you are going to establish
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.360]   what it is that is important to you.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.240]   What are the truths that exist
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.720]   rooted outside of just your own preferences
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   around which you were going to structure your life?
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.140]   This is committing to what is important to you.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.880]   There's three pieces to figuring out
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.400]   what your values are gonna be.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.200]   I'll write them all three down and then we'll talk about it.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.180]   Code, rituals, routines.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.960]   So code is actually figuring out,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.240]   this is my code that I live by.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.520]   I strive to do this.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.960]   I will never do this.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.100]   I have integrity.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.040]   I am honest.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.100]   I will prioritize the protection of others, whatever it is.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.720]   This is where you make that clear.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   I have a code by which I live
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.020]   and all of my decisions are gonna come back
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.100]   and make sure that they satisfy this code.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.480]   All my big decisions, all my short-term actions
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040]   will live by this code.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   The code should be something that forces you
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.600]   on occasion to do things that are hard or scary
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.640]   in the moment, to move away
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.240]   what might be in your best interest,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.340]   but you have a code written down.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.680]   Then you have rituals recorded,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.320]   some sort of rituals that you commit to
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   that help just reinforce in your life
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.280]   what it is that you value and take seriously.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.760]   Finally, you're gonna have routines,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.240]   things you do on a regular basis
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.440]   that ensure that you are supporting these values
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.760]   that are encoded in your code
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   that make sure that you are pursuing them,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   reflecting the things you value in your everyday life.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.800]   Now, of course, the most obvious pre-packaged answer
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.360]   to these three things would be a traditional religion.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.040]   So if you are already religious,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.200]   that's gonna make it very easy for you to figure out code
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.340]   or rituals and routines.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.400]   For if you're religious, the ritual is gonna involve,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   for example, let's say you're a Muslim,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.800]   it might involve daily prayer ritual
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840]   as a way of reinforcing and reminding yourself
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.080]   of your relationship to God.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.880]   Routines might involve things
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.040]   that your religion asks you to do,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.960]   such as some sort of charitable giving on a regular basis
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.080]   to go out and serve others in the community,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.120]   but you don't have to have a religion
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.000]   to fill in code rituals and routines.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.840]   You can do so on your own.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.320]   The thing I wanna emphasize here
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.020]   is don't worry so much about getting this exactly right,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.360]   because when we're done with this stack,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.580]   we're gonna add one final piece, which is iterate.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.200]   So you come to the stack where you are
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.560]   in your life right now,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.960]   and you can expect that might change and evolve
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.160]   as time goes on.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.960]   Now, everything you're gonna figure out here for values
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.280]   gets recorded in that system you set up
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.740]   during the first level of the stack, during discipline.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.420]   That's why I'm drawing an arrow back down there.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.040]   That's where you record, here's my code,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.080]   the things I value, things I don't,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.580]   how I plan to live my life.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.120]   That's where you record your rituals.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.460]   I meditate every morning.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.900]   I read a book of philosophy,
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.520]   one book per month.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.560]   I observe Shabbat as a time to reflect, whatever it is.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.160]   It's where the routines go in.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.840]   I volunteer every month.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   I, whatever it is actually gonna be,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.560]   and I go to services, whatever it is,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.760]   this is all written down,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.240]   and you have a central place for it
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.000]   because you set that up in discipline.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.680]   These two things, these first two layers of the stack,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.100]   discipline and values,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.480]   this now becomes our safety net foundation.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.320]   Before we go up, the things that are gonna follow
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.980]   are gonna be a little bit more complicated and ambitious,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.460]   but if everything else falls apart in your life,
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.520]   your professional system goes apart,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.420]   there's health or sickness issues,
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.160]   your life takes a turn, there's some sort of disaster,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.080]   the two levels that will always be there
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.360]   for you to fall down on will be discipline plus values.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.640]   So this is very important.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.580]   The idea that I can do things that are hard
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.120]   when it's in my long-term interest
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.960]   or the interest of my values, even if I don't want to,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   I'm capable of doing this, and I know what I'm all about,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.000]   what is my code, and I'm able to build my life around it,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.320]   that is your insurance for disaster.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.600]   That is your insurance against everything else going wrong.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.160]   If everything else we're about to talk about unravels,
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.760]   you will be able to fall back on that,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.960]   and that's gonna give you a soft landing,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.040]   and it's gonna give you a foundation
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.440]   in which you will eventually be able to rebuild.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.960]   All right, so now we're gonna head towards a layer
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   where we're getting a little bit more
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.740]   into the traditional design, life design type waters,
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.780]   and that's gonna be what I call calm.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:55.320]   So the goal with calm is to gain control over your life
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.260]   and to leverage that control
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.860]   to give yourself breathing room.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.960]   So it's the calm level of the stack
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.360]   where you are actually going to start thinking
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.880]   about organizational productivity systems.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.040]   How do I keep track of the different obligations
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.700]   in my professional life and my personal life?
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.760]   How do I plan?
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.160]   How do I manage my time?
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.200]   This is all about I have control.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   I'm not just stumbling reactively through life.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.240]   I have some control of what's going on.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.400]   Now, once you have control, I'm organizing things,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.360]   I can build out smart plans,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.440]   I can now see much more clearly the relationship
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.000]   between my implicit workload,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.800]   my tacit obligations and my schedule.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.400]   Now you have a really good sense of,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.720]   is this reasonable or not?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.960]   Or how much can I actually have on my plate
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.200]   before I begin to get stressed out?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.400]   And you can leverage this control
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.160]   to start doing some minimalism,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.240]   to start taking some things off of your plate,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   to simplify aspects of your commitments
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.120]   in your personal life, in your family life,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.320]   in your professional life.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.480]   The goal here is I have control of my time.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.720]   I've pruned my schedule to the degree
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.480]   that I have some flexibility and breathing room.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.300]   And I am now ready to start thinking
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.040]   about some bigger picture changes.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.280]   'Cause if we get to the final stack,
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.400]   which is where you do the fun stuff,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.760]   where you move to the farm,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.880]   if you get to that final stack
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   and your life is chaotic and you're overwhelmed
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.080]   and you're busy and exhausted and fatigued,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.240]   there's not gonna be room for you to do what you need to do.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.600]   There's not gonna be room for you to reflect.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.000]   There's not gonna be room for you to pursue the disciplines
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.560]   and values that lay under it.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   And there's not gonna be room
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.120]   to actually make the big changes.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.200]   If you don't control your life,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.600]   you also are not gonna be able
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.160]   to build up the career capital
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.760]   you'll probably need to execute some of these ideas.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.080]   The more you're killing it at work,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.000]   because you control your time and your obligations
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.800]   and you can give things the time they need,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   the more options you're gonna have to transform that work.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.960]   This is true in a lot of different elements as well.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.800]   And so this is again,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.760]   something you don't always see
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   when the discussion of lifestyle design,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.520]   but I think it's foundational.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.080]   I'm throwing it in there.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.160]   Calm, I'm under control.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.000]   These three things, if you're starting from scratch,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.960]   might take a while, by the way.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.360]   This might be the work of six months to a year
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.960]   to build the first three layers.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.920]   But once you have, you get to the final stack here,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.360]   the final layer of the stack,
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.960]   which I call plan.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   And this finally is where we get back
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.040]   to more familiar territory.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.880]   This is where we get back
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.040]   towards the deep life buckets territory.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.440]   This is where you divide your life
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.200]   into the major areas that are important to you
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.720]   and start to think through,
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.200]   what does my life look like in each of these areas?
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   What changes do I want to make?
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.640]   And you don't have to overhaul everything at the same time,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.560]   but maybe you look at community,
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.640]   so your relationship with your family and friends,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.000]   those who are important to you and say,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.800]   "Okay, let's start overhauling this.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.720]   "What do I want this aspect of my life to look like?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.680]   "Where does it fall short?
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.120]   "What type of changes would I need to make
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.760]   "to better fulfill my values here?"
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.680]   And this is where you might make the bigger change.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.360]   You move to be closer to family.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.040]   You commit the community organizations.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.000]   Maybe craft, of course, would be a big one here.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.920]   Your job, "Okay, let me really think about my job.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.760]   "What's going on here?
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.960]   "Is it overwhelming me?
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.880]   "Is it compatible with the other things I care about?
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.320]   "Maybe I want to hatch a plan to transform this job
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.560]   "into something that's gonna better support
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.040]   "my vision for my life."
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.080]   All of this happens here.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.000]   The buckets, lifestyle, center, career planning,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.840]   all of this is squeezed into the top layer out of four
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.800]   in the deep life stack.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.240]   And this really is the big innovation
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.160]   between the way we used to talk about it
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.800]   and the way we're talking about it now.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.360]   If discipline, values, and calm is foundational,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.400]   and if we ignore that, whatever we do up in plan
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.040]   is gonna be haphazard and be very likely to fizzle.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.520]   We try to make some big change,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.680]   but if we don't have anything else nailed down,
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.080]   we're building this big change,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.400]   this new conceptual structure for our life on top of sand.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.160]   That foundation is not strong enough.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.480]   I'm gonna add a couple more arrows here
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.240]   because again, throughout each of these stacks,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.680]   where do your decisions go?
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.080]   Back into that central repository you set up
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.240]   during the discipline level.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.280]   These are my organizational systems for calm.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.240]   This is what I'm working on right now.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.280]   I'm working on my craft bucket, and here's my vision.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.960]   So in that discipline step, that all got set up.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.360]   Now the number of disciplines,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.400]   the things that you are pursuing regularly
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.240]   that you're committed to,
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.800]   that also increases as you move up the stack.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.760]   Values adds rituals and routines
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.840]   to your list of disciplines.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.440]   Calm adds organizational systems
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.680]   to your list of disciplines.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.760]   Plan might add bucket specific keystone habits
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.160]   to your list of disciplines.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.760]   So everything down there grows.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.880]   The description of your systems,
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.400]   the descriptions of your discipline commitments,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.480]   that all grows as you move up the stack.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   So I have these arrows pointing back down.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.800]   And then finally, once you've made it
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.480]   through the whole stack,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.000]   I'm gonna draw one last arrow here,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.200]   you are going to iterate.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.440]   Which means you return back towards the bottom
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.800]   and refactor, focusing on what needs the most work.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.200]   So you've made it through the whole stack,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.680]   enjoy that for a while.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.920]   Then you're gonna iterate back down again.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.200]   Okay, let's go back down the discipline.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.240]   How is this going?
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.120]   If I cleaned up my description on my systems
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.960]   and my disciplines,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.360]   are there stuff hanging around here I don't do anymore?
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.200]   Let me clean that up,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.360]   make sure the way I'm tracking this goes well.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.520]   Am I committing discipline to the things I said I am?
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   If I'm not, do I have too many things in here?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.880]   Do I need to clean that up?
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.760]   Okay, we're good, let's move up the values.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.520]   Am I liking my current code?
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.680]   The rituals I have in place to help reinforce the code,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.160]   the routines I have to put that code
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.760]   into action in the world.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.920]   Am I ready to tweak that?
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.840]   Do I wanna make a major change?
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.960]   Am I maybe at first earlier in my life,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   these were self-imposed and in middle age with a family,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   they're gonna be more tied to a formal theology.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.920]   So you're going back and checking that out.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.520]   You're going up to calm.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.160]   How are my systems going for organization?
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.280]   Oh, maybe they're going well.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.120]   What about my load?
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.440]   You know, I feel overloaded.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.120]   Great, so as I revisit that stack,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.280]   I'm gonna make some more cuts
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.200]   on the things that I'm committed to or pursuing.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.240]   And you can back up the plan.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.080]   You might say, I'm gonna look
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.720]   at another bucket more carefully.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.000]   I looked at craft last time,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.040]   but I really wanna now think about celebration,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.560]   sort of quality in my life.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.520]   That's iteration.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.120]   You go back through the whole stack,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.600]   checking at each layer,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.640]   spending time on the layers that need time
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.760]   before moving on to the next.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.280]   You probably wanna do this once a year.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   I recommend using your birthday as the anchor for this.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.400]   Different years, you're gonna stop
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.000]   and spend more time on different layers than others.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.800]   Sometimes everything might be rock and rolling,
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.120]   so you're just tweaking on your way up
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.520]   and it takes you a couple of weeks, no problem.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.240]   Sometimes you're gonna lose the next six months
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.600]   of your years of really reflectively rethinking your life,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.000]   but this structures the way you think about that.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.520]   It structures the way you go through trying to refactor
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.360]   or tighten up what's actually going on
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.840]   in your day-to-day existence.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.040]   So this is what I'm thinking about now.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.480]   This is my generalization
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.160]   of what used to just be the deep life buckets,
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.080]   the deep life stack.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   It's equal parts psychology as it is practical habit,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.760]   as it is visionary planning.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.160]   All of those things are now mixed together
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.360]   in a more structured way.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.000]   This also reflects more carefully or closely,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.520]   I should say, what I actually do in my own life,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.760]   the way I think these things through,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.200]   the way I order these things.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.440]   So I'm interested in your thoughts.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.640]   Are we improving or have we overcomplicated?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.440]   I still have time to think about this,
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.960]   so feel free to send it through.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.160]   I don't know, Jesse, am I adding too much complication
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.440]   or are we getting to some levels we actually needed
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.960]   for thinking about this topic?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.160]   - I think it goes in hand with what you've talked about
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.960]   before in terms of stacks and discipline
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.120]   and metric tracking.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.000]   So like the metric tracking on the time block planner
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   would be in that level.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.400]   - Yeah, it becomes a discipline.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.520]   Right, the time block planner
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.160]   is something you might introduce as calm.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.240]   The metric planning is installed in the discipline stack.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.400]   Yeah, I think one of the things I was underestimating,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.320]   so in addition to just the psychological preparation,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.920]   was I take for granted structure and organization
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.040]   in my life.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.360]   And it's something we hear from listeners a lot,
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.240]   is if you are not organized and structured
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.920]   in how you manage just even the minutia of your life,
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.040]   it's actually really difficult to do anything big.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.320]   - It feels impossible or if you try it,
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.480]   it's not gonna go well because you're just throwing
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.440]   a big change in an already chaotic situation.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.040]   - Yeah, you've had that in place for a really long time.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.760]   - Yeah, and that's why I take it for granted.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.600]   - Yeah.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.480]   - But I think for a lot of people,
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.440]   I was thinking, if I'm gonna write a book
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   about the deep life, I can't jump into,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.200]   let's overhaul your job,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.920]   when there's someone who has never actually had
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.600]   any sort of coherent organizational system
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.880]   to any part of their life.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.040]   It's impossible, until you feel that you control
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   your life in that breathing room,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.280]   it's very difficult to imagine making a big change.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.200]   And we're gonna see that,
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.800]   the questions I chose for today's episode
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.240]   are all deep life related.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.640]   So issues and questions about people pursuing the deep life.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.120]   And we're gonna see some of that in the questions.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   There's at least one I have in mind where someone is,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.040]   they're coming to what you would think about
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.320]   as the plan level of the stack,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.280]   with the other levels not in place,
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.720]   and it just feels impossible to them.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.480]   - Yeah, I mean, a lot of that has come down
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.320]   to your time management system.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.040]   - Yeah, how do you keep track of your time?
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.320]   Then how do you manage your obligations?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.680]   And how do you then prune those obligations, right?
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's very difficult to keep breathing room in your life,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.040]   if you can't control the stuff that's taking away the air.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.880]   If you don't control it, you're just grabbing.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.720]   It's very hard to get at things or organize things
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.960]   or move things out of the way.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.520]   It's very paradoxical, 'cause people say,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.960]   "I don't wanna be so, I don't have time
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.400]   to do all these systems and be so rigid,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.040]   and then my whole life will be planning."
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.560]   But it's exactly the people that make a structure
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.400]   for the stuff in their life that have the flexibility.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.920]   - Yeah. - That have the breathing room,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.560]   that have their feet up by the lake and are reading.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.480]   It's this misnomer that somehow having organization
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.240]   will mean your time is more filled.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.040]   It's actually the key to actually gain back time,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.680]   to find time affluence, to take some flexibility.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.160]   - It's your boy, Jaco, discipline equals freedom.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.840]   - Yeah, well, that term is, yeah, definitely motivating
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.600]   or an inspiration here, discipline at the base.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.360]   - Provides the freedom to do other things.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.920]   - It does. - Read five books a month.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.520]   - And that was the other breakthrough I'm thinking,
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.600]   because I've found this working with people,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.040]   just finding that one or two things,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.680]   that's the place to start.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.440]   I'm doing this thing, I'm working on it every day,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   it's hard, it's optional, I don't wanna do it in the moment.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.520]   Long-term, I did it, I succeeded.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.880]   That psychological switch,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.800]   that's so important to everything else.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.280]   So we'll see, so I'm working on it,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.240]   but it's one idea for how I might structure
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.040]   my deep life book.
