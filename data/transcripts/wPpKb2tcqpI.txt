[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Each week, you send us a bunch of questions. We don't
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320]   always have all the answers, because sometimes finance questions don't have black or white
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.600]   answers. So our goal here is to provide some context, analysis, data, maybe a little perspective
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   to help you make better decisions. Remember, our email here is AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.400]   Today's sponsor, Portfolio Rescue, is sponsored by Craneshares. Craneshares is an investment
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.880]   company that allows you to invest in China. Now, I'm going to have to admit, I don't have
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.200]   a great read on the Chinese economy, and the entire way that country operates is kind of
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.160]   confusing to me. I really didn't know who to trust or who to believe for a lot of things.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.760]   That's why I read Brendan Ahern's "China Last Night" newsletter. Brendan's a CIO there.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.080]   We've had him on "Animal Spirits" before. I think he's been on "Compounded Friends" before.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.360]   He created this great newsletter. You can choose to get it on a daily or a weekly basis.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   Just about the Chinese economy, the companies, the news, all that stuff in one place. He
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.040]   summarizes it. Makes your life easier to be an investor in the know about China. If you

[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.360]   Also, ni hao to any Chinese viewers right now.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.760]   Okay, we do have an international audience. We've got some questions today from international
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.960]   viewers. So we're getting creamed again today in the stock market. Apparently Jerome Powell
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   doesn't like Santa Claus. He just ended the Santa Claus rally. It's interesting how much
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.680]   back and forth we've had. I looked at just the date, because we're down 2.8% or something
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.840]   in the S&P last time I checked. This, including today, would be the 23rd 2% or worse day this
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.960]   year. So at 8x, we've been down 3% or worse. Alternatively, we've been up 2% or more 23x,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.040]   and we've been up 3% or more 4x. So I just think with the constant back and forth like
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   this where you think everything is up and it feels great, okay, late at the end of the
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.320]   tunnel, and then, oh wait, we're down again, getting crushed, okay, now we're going to
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.240]   get creamed again. It's constant back and forth. And I think just, I just want to give
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.720]   everyone out there, if you just survived this year without making a huge mistake or blowing
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.080]   yourself up, I think you can give yourself a pat on the back. Right? That's my Christmas
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   gift to everyone here.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920]   I can't. I can't give myself a pat on the back.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.560]   No pat on the back for you? All right. Sorry. You've got a nice sweater though. All right,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.600]   let's do a question.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.040]   Okay. Up first today, we have a question from Jay. I'm 36 and based in the UK. I own my
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.880]   own home with no mortgage, max out my pension contributions, have 93,000 in cash and a tax
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.000]   advantage savings account with Vanguard called an ISA here. You can only contribute $20,000
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   or 20,000, I guess, pounds a year, and 55,000 cash in a non-tax advantage savings account
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   earning minimal interest. I was looking for advice on how to best invest the cash I have
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.040]   in these accounts. It seems like the market has fallen a lot, although less so in the
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.480]   UK than in the US and Europe, not to brag. My words, not theirs. And I've read that it's
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.720]   best to invest lump sum balances all at once rather than slowly over time. But that is
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   quite a scary proposition in this environment. What would you suggest as the best approach?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.640]   Should I just put it all in Vanguard index funds all at once? If not, what advice would
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.880]   you give for how much and how often to invest?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.200]   Like I said, this is a global show. We get a lot of questions from international investors
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.040]   and viewers. Many U.S. investors might not know that the UK stock market is whipping
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.400]   the U.S. stock market this year. John, throw that up. This is just the iShares. I think
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.080]   this is as of yesterday, so it doesn't include today's losses. It was basically flat on the
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.240]   year in the UK, and the S&P down 14% or so. I think from the perspective of a UK investor
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.200]   not taking into account the moves in the dollar, you're probably doing even better. Obviously,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.360]   the lump sum dollar cost averaging question is one we get a lot and we've touched on before.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.160]   It's one of those things that there's no easy answer because it's a spreadsheets versus
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.280]   emotions question. The spreadsheet tells you lump sum is a higher probability event. The
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.600]   stock market is up three out of every four years on average. That's a pretty good ... If
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.520]   you had a 75% winning percentage at the casino, you'd take that every day, right? Unfortunately,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   those long-term market averages include a wide range of results. Personally, I use the
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.200]   lump sum if I get something. I don't want to invest. I know if I'm investing in stocks,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.880]   it's going to be for 10+ years, call it. More in most cases. But I understand why so many
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.640]   people prefer dollar cost averaging. There's a higher probability of regret if you put
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   that lump sum in and you're wrong. I recently helped someone this year implement a dollar
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.160]   cost averaging strategy. So, we decided, "Alright, I'm going to take this lump sum and break
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.960]   it into six parts. We're going to make one investment of those six parts every 15th of
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.680]   the month, come hell or high water." It actually worked out better than a lump sum this year
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.920]   because the stock market was so volatile. So, they were able to invest a bunch of points
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   that were much lower than when we started the year. And then, we came to the last time
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   that they could invest. So, they made their first five investments. They're pretty happy.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   The sixth one comes and they say, "Well, we've had a little bit of a bear market rally here.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.440]   What if we just pulled back and waited on this last one?" And I personally was against
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   this strategy. I think the whole point of creating a plan in advance, especially with
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.720]   something like this, is that you don't know what's going to happen in the future. There's
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.920]   this great story from The Making of an American Capitalist, which is the Roger Lowenstein
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.200]   book about Buffett, where I think in 1966, the market fell like 22%, a pretty decent
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.760]   bear market. And a bunch of Buffett's investors called him after that bear market already
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.920]   happened and said, "Hey, the stock market is going lower. Don't put your cash to work
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.080]   yet." And Buffett responded with something like, "If you didn't know in February that
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   the Dow was going to get crushed, then why didn't you let me in then? And if you didn't
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.640]   know what was going to happen back then, how do you know anymore now?" So, the point is,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   the future is never clear, even when it feels like it is. So, I told my dollar-cost averaging
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.440]   friend, "Stick with the strategy you chose six months prior," because that was the plan
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.600]   at the time. So, I don't think there's any amount or interval that... There's no right
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.760]   or wrong answer there. It's horseshoes and hand grenades, close enough, basically. So,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.000]   I just think you pick an amount, you pick an interval, and you follow it hell or high
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.680]   water. And I think that's the simplest strategy, if obviously you can't handle that lump sum,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.200]   which it sounds like this person can't. Right. And Nick Majulie has written a lot about this.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.320]   We have kind of a legendary video of him and Josh that, if you haven't seen, you should
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.000]   check out on our channel, where they're talking about this very thing of dollar-cost averaging.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.680]   Yeah, Nick's kind of definitively proven the lump sum makes more sense. But I think if
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.200]   you realize, "I can't handle a lump sum," then just pick a strategy you can stick with.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.800]   Right. Alright, let's do another one. Okay, up next we have a question from Sharon. "When
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.160]   my husband and I bought our first home in 1998, our mortgage rate with a 20% down payment
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.320]   and excellent credit was about 8.5%, and that was lower than rates had been. We would have
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.080]   loved to get a 7% interest rate, which you think of as high. The opposite point of view,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.400]   which you didn't talk about, is that we don't want 6% to 8% inflation getting entrenched.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.180]   You're talking about the bad things from high interest rates, but what about the bad things
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.720]   from persistently high inflation? It really lowers the value of your savings. Taking a
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.200]   pause and seeing what happens, as Ben suggested, is what the Fed did in the '70s, isn't it?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.760]   Inflation just kept going higher. Didn't Volcker have to cause a recession before inflation
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.480]   slowed down?" They sound like they're talking about a very specific comment, I guess, by
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.560]   you on Animal Spirits or something, maybe?
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   I think a lot of times -- and Twitter, it's called a subtweet. This is like a sub-question,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.200]   where they're taking some shots at me, which is fine.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.320]   I was thinking, does this person like Ben or hate Ben, as a reading reviewer?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.200]   I've been hearing from a lot of people who lived through the '70s, who keep saying that
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.480]   I'm nuts to think that the Fed should slow down a little bit with their rate hikes. No
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.160]   one wants a repeat of the '70s, when I think inflation averaged more than 7% for the entire
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.200]   decade. That's what the Fed official was saying, too, in the Treasury. Janet Yellen said, "I
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.160]   came of age and studied economics in the '70s. I remember what that terrible period was like.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   No one wants to see that happen again." That's the Fed's whole line of thinking right now.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.960]   I understand that sentiment, that people who dealt with high inflation in the past don't
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.640]   want to see that again.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.160]   Let me offer some counterpoints first. In 1998, the median single-family home price
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.520]   was around $130,000. I circled it right there. Assuming 20% down, that would be a monthly
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.560]   mortgage payment of around $800, even with those 8.5% interest rates. Today, the median
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.040]   price of a single-family existing home is like $385,000. Do the same 20% down payment
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.360]   at 8.5%, and we're talking a $2,500 a month payment. Even if you adjust that for inflation,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.260]   that 1998 number is more like $1,400, so housing is way more expensive today. The way the housing
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.800]   market is today, we can't really handle higher interest rates like they had back then. Housing
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.920]   was just cheaper back then.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.200]   I don't think you could get a parking spot in Brooklyn today for $800 a month.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.760]   That sounds about right. There are some similarities for the '70s analogy. Both periods saw this
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.040]   massive increase in government spending. Obviously, for different reasons. There was no pandemic
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.240]   back then. There was this commodity shock, especially in energy and food prices back
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.200]   then. And then, we both periods saw above-trend wage growth.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.600]   John, throw out my wage growth here. This is wage growth versus inflation by decade.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.500]   In the '70s, you had massive wage growth, but that's because inflation was high. '80s,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.100]   same thing. It's high and high. 2000s, we had slow inflation, slow wage growth. 2010s,
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.460]   same thing. Through the end of September, when I have my wage data through, wages were
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.820]   up 17% this decade already, which is almost as much as the whole previous decade. We're
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.260]   two years in, three years in. CPI was up just 16% then. That relationship is holding.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.820]   This is why the Fed is worried about inflation, and why people who are concerned about the
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.740]   '70s, same thing. Here's the thing. The money supply was rising throughout the '70s. The
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.500]   Fed didn't step in as aggressively as they are now. It's currently crashing. John, throw
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.460]   out my M2 chart here. M2 money supply. This is the year-over-year change. You can see
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.420]   it's crashing. The government is not spending anymore. This is already back on trend or
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:48.900]   below it. Also, in the 1970s, oil prices went from $2 a barrel to $34 a barrel by 1981.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.980]   It was a 17-fold increase. Oil started this decade at like $60 a barrel. To match that
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.020]   gain, it would have to go to $1,000 a barrel. Anything is possible. That seems highly unlikely
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.540]   to me. Workers also had way more bargaining power back then, because unions were more
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.260]   prevalent. There's no more unions these days, right? Also, things that we have today that
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.340]   didn't happen in the '70s, like technology, this huge deflationary force. Baby boomers
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.140]   were in the prime years back then, just like the millennials today. But they didn't have
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:25.820]   the offsetting demographic like the baby boomers now, that are kind of an offset. I just think
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:32.380]   that the Fed is so much further along. I'm just saying, chill out for a while. Plus,
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.560]   the thing is, the New York Fed puts this out every month, I think. Inflation expectations
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.140]   are coming down. The New York Fed said inflation expectations are like 3% for next year, for
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   the next year and the next three years. The '70s was about those inflation expectations
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.020]   becoming entrenched. That's not happening right now. I still think it could be a while
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.620]   until we get 2% to 3% inflation, but I don't see a repeat of the '70s. I don't see the
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.860]   need to crash the economy if you don't have to. That's my whole stance here. Good pushback,
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.860]   though.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:06.180]   Yeah, that sounds like a pretty solid, fair point. I think your time as a full-fledged
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:12.660]   apologist for the Fed, though, has probably hurt your take on this, in some people's eyes.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.120]   I've changed course this year.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   Yeah, you've been critical.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.020]   John Cain's quote? Yes. All right, let's do another one.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.540]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Charles. Josh Brown mentioned on a recent show that
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.820]   he is not a fan of non-traded REITs. Can you explain the difference between publicly traded
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.200]   and non-traded REITs? I'm considering an investment in the real estate space and trying to figure
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.540]   out the biggest risk for each option. Talking about risk.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.420]   Yeah, let's ask the man himself. Let's bring Josh in. Josh Brown, downtown.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.580]   Am I on? I can't see. Oh, there I am. Okay. I was watching for some reason on regular
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580]   YouTube instead of watching from behind the scenes. I don't know why. All right. Hey,
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.860]   guys. Great to be with you, Duncan. I love your sweater. Ben, can I make one announcement?
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   I know it's your show.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860]   You got it.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:03.860]   Okay. Listen to me. This is the best personal finance show on all of YouTube. I'm saying
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.100]   that. And I have looked at the other shows that are covering topics like this, and they're
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.500]   just not good. They're very un-good. This is the best one. So you guys have grown this
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.860]   audience all year. It's only going to get bigger. And at a certain point, I don't even
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.700]   know how you're going to walk in public, because people are going to be like, "That's my personal
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.580]   finance, guys." So I just wanted to say it's the end of the year. I watch every episode.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.020]   Early Christmas present from Josh. What a guy.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.620]   I'm a huge fan of what you guys are doing every week, bringing on really smart people
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.020]   besides me, actual experts on topics, and it's awesome.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.980]   Well, I think the first time I ever heard about non-traded REITs was your book came
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.840]   out in what, 2011, 2012?
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.700]   Backstage. And you called it a murder hole. Is that right?
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:56.500]   They still are. Don't buy non-traded REITs. All right. So just let's invert. What is the
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.140]   advantage of a non-traded REIT over a public REIT? Historically, you may have been able
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.460]   to make the argument that, "Well, I can invest in niche real estate that doesn't have a publicly
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.780]   traded version." That's no longer true. In fact, there are so many REITs, they have their
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.860]   own sector in the S&P today. I think that's a change that happened five or six years ago.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:24.120]   There used to be 10 S&P sectors and they threw the REITs under financials. Now there's actually
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.340]   a real estate sector. So throw that out. You got plenty of choices.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.940]   The second argument is, "Well, private real estate is cheaper. You're getting better valuations."
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.540]   That's also completely false. The only way it can be true is if they are late to mark
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.620]   the actual values of the property to match with what reality is saying. And I think if
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.580]   you ever have to choose between who's right, the public markets or the private markets,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:58.260]   like 99 times out of 100, trust the public markets. They'll be more volatile, but they're
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.180]   going to get to the truth faster because they can, because there are transactions.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.340]   So do the people who create the non-traded REITs just not want to go through the process
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.980]   of going public? Is that the whole deal?
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.380]   No, no, no. They want to create something that's exclusive. So when they sell it to
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:18.420]   wealth management clients or they sell it to family offices, it's got this mystique
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.700]   to it. Like, "Oh, no one else can get in on this." Or, "I'm bringing this to you today
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.220]   and you can't access it somewhere away from me."
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.820]   It's like developing a group at a nice club kind of thing.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:36.020]   Yeah. And then there's really high fees. There's very little transparency. And it's not that
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.260]   they're all bad. There are obviously good versions of it, but how would you know? And
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   there have been so many scandals with non-traded REITs. There have been so many frauds, so
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.420]   many situations of people getting income distributions that are actually just the person getting
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:58.020]   their own money back. It's almost like a crime wave over the last 20 years. It's all I've
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:04.740]   ever seen is every time real estate comes down, yeah, the public REITs go down in price,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.060]   but the private ones go to zero and they end up in court.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.300]   So it's no disrespect. If you're in the private REIT space, I'm not saying everything you're
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.700]   doing is bad or it can't ever be good. I'm saying from an investor's perspective, if
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.540]   you're not getting a discount on the real estate, which we know now private markets
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.740]   if anything are more frothy than public markets. Just look at tech. You could buy publicly
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:35.340]   traded technology companies now at 25 times earnings. What people were paying for startups
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:41.100]   over the last five years is outrageous. So I think that the same dynamic exists in private
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:48.140]   real estate. There's not discounts. So I think there's a lot of reasons not to do it. I can't
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:53.620]   think of any to do it. So I would always be biased toward publicly traded, liquid, New
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.700]   York Stock Exchange listed REITs.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.740]   And I've heard you talk in the past about thinking about making private transactions
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.740]   yourself and you thought like, "It's not worth the headache. I'm just going to buy REITs."
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.200]   Talk a little about that, why you think that way.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.100]   So I was talking to a friend of mine who buys property. He builds million dollar, multi-million
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:17.940]   dollar homes. He doesn't renovate houses. This is all he does. He knocks down 50-year-old
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:25.380]   homes and builds brand new, really beautiful homes. And he got involved with strip malls
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:33.500]   and he's a real estate guy. His father was a real estate guy. This is all they do. And
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.320]   I was like, "I have some money. I have a lot of exposure to the stock market and the bond
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.420]   market because of my job. Most of my net worth is tied up in Ritholtz Wealth. And I don't
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.860]   need more stocks. I'm good on stocks. I want to do real estate." And he's just like, "I
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.620]   don't think that's a good idea." I'm like, "No, I just want to give you money and you
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.100]   do what you do and I share the returns with you. I just want to be the capital." He's
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.680]   like, "I don't need your money and it's a bad idea." Because real estate, you're either
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.860]   doing it or you're not doing it. It should not be a side hustle.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.020]   Right. It's a full-time thing.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:20.240]   If you're doing it well. And especially for me, my side hustles have side hustles. So
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.840]   I'm not going to pay any attention to it. So I love publicly traded REITs. I own them
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:31.640]   in my IRA. I try to own them in a tax-deferred account because the income on a REIT is not
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:41.600]   like an equity dividend. You're paying ordinary income taxes, REIT for your taxes. So you
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.500]   want to own REITs in an IRA. And the second thing that I think you want to do, don't take
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:57.680]   the money. Reinvest. You want those distributions to go right back into buying more shares if
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.620]   you're not taking the money anyway. So those are the two things that I tend to do with
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.020]   publicly traded REITs.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.680]   It makes sense. All right, Duncan, let's do another one.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.140]   Okay. The one thing, that's called qualified versus non-qualified dividend, right? That's
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.140]   the terminology?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.300]   I don't know. It's your show. What do you think?
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.020]   I've just heard that thrown around a lot. That's why I was...
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.700]   It sounded smart, Duncan.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.220]   Okay. I think that's what it is. I have no idea.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.680]   Are you challenging me?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.040]   I was just wondering if that's what that means. I hear people talk about qualified versus
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   non-qualified dividends.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   Yes.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:40.800]   Okay. Got you. Got you. All right. So up next, we have a question from Eric. "What industries
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.560]   or sectors will perform best coming out of this market downturn? My best guess is that
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.440]   risk assets, tech stocks with smaller market caps, will perform the strongest. I'm wondering
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.000]   if I should start buying these risk assets given the current economic environment. I'm
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.300]   young and I don't mind catching a falling knife." Famous last words. "I want to position
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.600]   myself best to capture the most return on the eventual upswing in our future. Do you
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.920]   think I should wait for the Fed to stop raising rates before I start buying?" So it sounds
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.720]   like they already have in mind what they want to do, right?
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   I have thoughts on the Fed thing here, but let's start with the winners coming out of
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.280]   a crisis. My only rule of thumb here is that the winners going into it are basically never
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.840]   the winners coming out of it, right? I think a recession is like a pivot point. You saw
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.960]   this from the pandemic. Tech stocks going in, anything long duration, and then coming
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.400]   out of it after that whole transition period, we have value stocks and cash flow producers,
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.360]   and it wasn't the same stocks. It was energy stocks that were getting crushed before. So
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.480]   that's my only rule of thumb, is that if you think the thing that was doing well going
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.800]   into it is going to be the same coming out of it, you're probably going to be wrong.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:48.340]   100%. And the classic example is to look at the leaders of the '90s. And some of them,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.220]   it took 15 years. The companies are still relevant today. It took until 2017 before
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.480]   they were eclipsing those year 2000 highs.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.680]   Microsoft was like 14 years to go back to peak.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   And here's what's important about that. Let's separate the stock from the business. A lot
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.600]   of people don't understand this. Microsoft actually grew earnings all that time. Steve
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.520]   Ballmer gets ridiculed. He's a billionaire. People are laughing at him. OK, fine. But
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   he gets ridiculed.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.140]   It's because of his dance moves.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:27.240]   Sure. He is hilarious. A lot of aspects of him are hilarious. But think about the worst
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.960]   timing in history to become the CEO of Microsoft. I think Bill Gates handed him the reins in
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   the year 2000. So then he runs this company, and he does dumb stuff, of course, like everybody.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:44.680]   The Zune is an obvious example. He mocks the iPhone. OK, fine. But still, I think Microsoft's
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.840]   earnings doubled or tripled under his leadership.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.080]   But it was time for a change, and it made sense. But it's not like he didn't run the
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.160]   business well. He might have missed some opportunities. But Microsoft's fundamentals were fine. It's
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.700]   the stock price, the valuation. That was the problem.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:08.940]   Another example is Cisco. The valuation that you were paying for Cisco in 2000 was so outrageous
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.900]   that the company actually has grown in size substantially since then, and it's been steady,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.380]   and they buy back stock, and it pays a dividend, and like everything you would want a company
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:27.100]   to do, and it still hasn't retaken that old valuation. It's 22 years ago we're talking
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.100]   about.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:35.460]   That is a big reason why the leaders of the prior bull market aren't usually—because
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.500]   the fact that they were leaders led to this huge valuation overhang that almost no matter
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.220]   what these companies do, they're going to underperform. I'm giving you one example,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.820]   but there's 50 examples of this documented.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:56.660]   So I don't love the idea of let me buy some small market cap tech. The other thing with
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.620]   that is like 70% of all companies that have ever been publicly traded disappeared. Is
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.460]   that the number? You know this information, right?
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.520]   That's a terrifying stat.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   It's 60, 70%?
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   It's a lot.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.740]   So get out of here. What are you doing here?
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.740]   The other thing, this is a young person. I don't like the idea of using the Fed to time
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.900]   your purchases as a young person. You're buying in a down market.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.260]   That's a whole other thing.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.220]   In 30 or 40 years, you're not going to be mad at yourself for buying a little early.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.420]   If markets keep going down from here and you bought now and then you buy again later, you're
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.820]   not going to kick yourself for buying in a bear market.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.020]   So trying to time in the market, guess what? The market is not going to wait around for
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.020]   the Fed.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.900]   The market is going to move before the Fed does and it's already been trying to.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.540]   So I think using the Fed to try, I know it seems like the Fed has their tentacles and
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.540]   everything these days and they kind of do, but using them to time your purchases just
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.780]   makes no sense to me.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:53.900]   Last thing on this, I highly recommend going to Verdad Capital and finding, I know they've
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.760]   written about this a bunch of times, but there was something they did specifically six months
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:06.180]   ago about where to be into the next recovery, like the first sectors to react and the biggest
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.960]   reaction on the way out and it's small cap value.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.900]   And actually I think they just raised a fund that they're planning to hold in cash and
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:23.400]   they're waiting for like high yield bonds to blow up and they're going to start looking
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.340]   at either the equities of those issuers or the bonds themselves.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.700]   But that is where you get the most bang for your buck if you're playing for a recovery
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.700]   historically.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.140]   It may not work this time.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.020]   Things that have never happened before happen all the time, but that mentality, like what's
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.260]   going to lead us out or what's going to give you the best chance to optimize a portfolio
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:53.220]   coming out of a recession, it's almost never going to be small cap speculative stocks.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.900]   It's just not what people are looking for in that moment.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.100]   - And my biggest advice to people that are trying to do this, just don't do it with your
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.100]   whole portfolio.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.500]   If you want to take a piece and try to time the next winner, that's fine, but don't do
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.180]   it with your whole portfolio, because if you're wrong, you're going to kick yourself, because
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.380]   the whole market's going to take off without you potentially.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.820]   - John Carlo is asking, he always thought that this TV set was my house.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.660]   It is not my house.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.700]   It is one of my many offices, shout to John Carlo.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:27.460]   Tom Lowry said I'm taking over the show, I apologize, I'm going to talk less.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.020]   - We've got another question anyway, let's do it, Duncan.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.980]   - Okay, so last but not least we have a question from Jeff.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.600]   Collective wisdom is that markets go up over the long term.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.980]   While this may have been the case in the past, it's the baby boomers who control the vast
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.620]   majority of the equity market on a generational basis, and they are in the process of selling
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.940]   out in mass due to financing retirement over the next decade.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.280]   Is there a real cause for concern that could trigger endless selling pressure and keep
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.580]   returns down for decades to come?
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.260]   I'm coming at this question as a 30-something, thanks.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.400]   I like this question, it's like philosophical.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.660]   - I was at a holiday party last week, and my dad is still known as the finance guy in
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   the family beyond me.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.900]   People go to him with finance questions before they come to me, and one of the like younger
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.260]   Gen Z- - What did your dad do for a living?
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.060]   - He was a CFO at a hospital, so he's still like the tax finance guy.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   - Makes sense.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:21.660]   - But one of the Gen Z cousins' husbands kind of said, "Is Social Security actually going
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.300]   to be here for me when I get older, or are the baby boomers just going to take it all?"
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.980]   I think there is, and we tried to set him straight on that, but there is this idea that
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.300]   the cupboards are going to be left bare by the baby boomers, and I think there's a few
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.780]   reasons that this is wrong.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.860]   First, the biggest thing is just that 10% of the households own 90% of the stocks.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.900]   Most of these people are going to pass the money down and not going to have to sell it.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.980]   It's not like there's this huge cohort of people that are going to be force sellers
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.020]   in the next 10 years, and I think most of it's just going to go to the Millennials and
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.580]   Gen X and Gen Z anyway, right?
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.980]   John, throw up the chart here on the demographics.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.540]   Gen Z and Millennials are going to be there to step in and buy those shares from the baby
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540]   boomers.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.980]   Look at, I mean, the biggest demographic right now is 20 to 34, 35 to 49 is just as large
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.420]   as 50 to 64.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   There's plenty of young people coming up to step in and Millennials are, I know people
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.260]   complain the Millennials say we don't have any money, but they went to college more than
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.260]   any other demographic.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.500]   They're going to be making money eventually.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.820]   They're going to be in their primary years to buy the stocks from the baby boomers.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.380]   Josh, are you going to talk about your own witless bid?
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.380]   No.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.380]   I'm going to try to remain calm.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.380]   I was going to bring that up to him.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.380]   We'll throw that out.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.620]   I'm going to remain calm, but when I hear this demographic cliff stuff, this is when
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:41.540]   I wrap barbed wire around a baseball bat and start busting heads like this has been the
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:49.140]   stupidest argument to not be invested that has persisted the longest that like of any
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.460]   of the arguments I can think of, this is the worst, most persistent one is so dumb.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.540]   First of all, people were worried about this in the nineties.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.860]   Okay.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:06.460]   Like second of all, Harry Dent, who is a level three charlatan, he has been, he's been
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.940]   using this as a reason to scare people into buying his books or investing in his piece
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.840]   of shit ETF.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.660]   This has been something that he, and it's been wrong all the time because it's, it doesn't
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.980]   reflect real life.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.140]   I've been in the wealth management industry for 20 years.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.280]   I have never once seen a baby boomer or older.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   What do we call them?
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   The greatest generation.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.020]   I have never in the wild actually seen somebody spend down their portfolio and die.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.060]   I don't think any, it's true.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.320]   If there's a financial advice, if there's a financial advisor in the chat who would
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.080]   like to share an anecdote of actually watching a client, a wealth management client spend
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.180]   down their money, sell all their stocks and then die, please inform me.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.580]   I've never seen it.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   I've never seen it.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.540]   And I know thousands of financial advisors.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.020]   Like for middle class people who are going to have to sell down their financial assets,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.460]   they have more of their money in their house than they do in the stock market.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.300]   So you could probably make the case that it's going to impact the housing market more.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.240]   But even then those houses are going to get passed on to the next generation.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.980]   This is just what happens.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.780]   My whole block, my whole block where I live turned over.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.780]   It's all people with babies.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.780]   It's amazing.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.780]   It's awesome.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.780]   I'm like the old parent on the block.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   Now I moved in with a two year old daughter in a stroller and my wife pregnant.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.380]   And now my kids are babysitting and it's all because life goes on.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.140]   And by the way, Generation X was smaller than the baby boomers.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.620]   And this is where this nonsense all got started.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.700]   Generation X is like there's like 66 million of us and the boomers I think at their peak
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.420]   were like 78 million.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.980]   So that's where all this stuff really started.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.140]   The thing is though the millennials are 73 million.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.940]   There are more millennials now alive than there are baby boomers.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.980]   That's the circle of life Simba, right?
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.420]   So that's who's buying the stocks.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.780]   There's no cliff.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.500]   And Gen Y, Gen Z is in the workforce.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   They all work at Facebook.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.780]   They're making TikToks about the coffee bar at Meta.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.780]   Wake up.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.940]   That's not an issue.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.580]   And the housing thing I could see.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.580]   But that's going to be regional.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.060]   That's not going to be national.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.700]   And the other thing is you made the point before that people's retirement plans in the
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.260]   past where they just died.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.300]   Yes, it's not relevant.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.540]   They're going to live so much longer than people did in the past that their retirements
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.540]   are going to last so much longer.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.620]   It's not like it's this end date that we have a cliff coming where everyone's going to sell
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.620]   in one day.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.380]   They're going to live for 20, 30 years in retirement.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.380]   Listen to me.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.380]   Listen to me.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:40.420]   Not only do they not sell down their stocks en masse all at once, the newest innovation
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.680]   in wealth management, and it hasn't blown up yet, maybe it never will, is securities
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.400]   based loans.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.280]   So now they get to live the lifestyle as though they were liquidating their equity portfolio
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.820]   without even selling anything.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:02.000]   I think they get a 50% borrow against their bonds, treasuries, and munis, and like a 30%
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.180]   borrow against their stocks.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.900]   So like the market has to really collapse for any of those loans to require a capital
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   call.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.940]   So now, thanks to innovations on Wall Street, and this has been going on for a long time.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.740]   It's not last year.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.860]   Now you've got people living a retirement lifestyle and then dying and then passing
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.100]   on an entire portfolio of equities to the next generation.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.960]   So if that's your reason to be worried about the markets, all you have to do is think one
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.140]   step beyond demographics, which I'm not an expert in demographics.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   I know the numbers.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   You know the numbers.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.340]   You just have to think, how do people actually live?
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.060]   They don't live that way.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.600]   They don't say, "Oh, I'm 70, better sell my stocks."
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:54.100]   That's just not, life expectancy, there's a whole other thing we could go into.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.260]   So it's, please, don't pay attention to that stuff.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.060]   - The other thing is, literally everyone who pays attention to this stuff knows this is
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.060]   coming.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.900]   It's not like the market couldn't get ahead of this and see it coming, right?
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.780]   It's pretty easy to look at the census data and know what the demographics are going to
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   be.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.820]   If this is that big of a threat, don't you think on some level, the equity market has
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.220]   priced in the potential impact of it?
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.500]   - Okay, so the stock market is not going to die from the baby boomers dying off.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   You know what's going to die?
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.060]   I've used this joke before, I'm sorry.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.100]   Woody tighties with the blue and yellow waistband, when the baby boomers die, those are never
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.100]   coming back.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.140]   - What a classic.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.340]   - That's the last generation to wear those.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.980]   - I don't even understand how that hasn't happened already.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.300]   Oh, you know what else is going to die?
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.340]   Locker rooms at fitness clubs.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.660]   It's enough already.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.460]   It's enough.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   That's the last generation.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.060]   - Wait, you're not a fan of aggressive nudity?
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.580]   - Just wandering around naked with a chest full of gray hair.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   - Towel on the shoulder.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.580]   Towel on the shoulder.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.580]   Use the towel.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:57.260]   - So my generation doesn't do that shit and there's no way yours and Duncan.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.980]   That's never coming back.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.140]   We're all never nudes.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.580]   From my age on down, we're in jean shorts under the towel.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.820]   We're not doing group showers.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   So that's another thing that will die with the boomers.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   - Oh God.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.820]   - Thank God.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.820]   - All right.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.140]   New Compound and Friends tomorrow, correct?
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.740]   - New Compound and Friends, yeah, tomorrow night.
