[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580]   A podcast listener named Daniel writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, how does
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.460]   Christian hedonism avoid making joy into an idol?" Well, the short answer is,
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:26.600]   Christian hedonism doesn't make a god or an idol out of joy, because Christian
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.640]   hedonism says we make a god out of whatever we find most joy in. That's the
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:45.400]   short answer. So find your greatest joy in God and thus be done with all
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.560]   idolatry. But his question is, how do you avoid making that mistake? It's not as
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   though the mistake can't be made. In fact, that would be my first statement about
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.480]   how to avoid it, is to say, "Admit it can happen." And I admit it can happen, not
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.800]   just because Daniel asked me how not to let it happen, but because the Bible says
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.040]   it actually does happen in 2nd Timothy 3, where Paul says, "In the last
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.280]   days men will be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God." Now when I
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.720]   read that, I say, "Really? That's amazing! The fallen human heart is capable of
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.480]   suicidal illusions." Because I call it an illusion, because if you make pleasure
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.800]   the object of your love, it's like making love the object of your love. It's like
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.680]   making being pleased the object of being pleased. It's self-contradictory. It's
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.080]   self-defeating. My capacity, my faculty for delighting was made to delight in
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   something. Delighting wasn't made to delight in delighting. Delighting was
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.320]   made to delight in something. If you delight in the delighting, you're like a
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.280]   hunter who aims to shoot his bullet. He's not going to get any deer that
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   way. He's going to go hungry, which is why I said it's suicidal. It's an
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600]   illusion. And yet it's true. I mean, it's a good question. It's not a stupid
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.760]   question, because Paul says men will be lovers of pleasure. Men will be so stupid
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.680]   and so insane and so drawn in on themselves, they will commit the
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.920]   suicidal hunting of trying to shoot the bullet in their gun. But here's
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.600]   another safeguard. I mean, we could talk about this all day, but let me just
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   give you a few. Christian hedonism says never merely pursue your joy.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800]   That's hedonism. That's not Christian hedonism. That's just hedonism.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.880]   Christian hedonism says pursue your joy in God, or more precisely, pursue your joy
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   in all that God is for you in Christ. And I say is for you, not does for you. In God,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.760]   not through God. God is the end of our quest. He's not a means. There's nothing
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.060]   more ultimate than God. So when we rejoice in his works, which the Bible
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.960]   says we should do, we are rejoicing in the God we see in his works and know
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.280]   through his works. We are receiving his works not as our substitute for God, but
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.440]   as a pointer to God. So the second caution or safeguard against turning
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.400]   pleasure or joy into an idol is to say that we always rejoice in God. Here's
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.080]   another one. We, Christian hedonists, explain that joy is a way of
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   glorifying God. I mean, this is the most fundamental thing, right? We say it,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.240]   "Desiring God, we exist to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.320]   for the joy of all peoples, by highlighting the truth that God is most
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him." Everybody knows that
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.200]   you don't glorify yourself, and you don't glorify pleasure when you take supreme
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.560]   pleasure in somebody. And I've told my Rose story a hundred times, but I'll just
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.880]   give the conclusion of it here. So if I say to my wife, "There's nothing that
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.320]   would give me more satisfaction than to spend the evening with you tonight," she
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.880]   would never say to me, "You are so selfish! All you ever think about is what will
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.520]   bring you satisfaction! That's why you want to take me out tonight, because I
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   make you satisfied!" She would never say that, because I am glorifying her
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.960]   satisfying qualities by telling her she makes me happy. And so when you come to
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.480]   worship on Sunday morning and you're driven by this by the sense of, "God, I'm
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.280]   here to spend time with you because there's nobody in all the world who can
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.440]   make me more happy," he's not going to say to you, "You are so selfish coming to
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.160]   me." No! Because we glorify him when he satisfies us. Here's another one.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.040]   Here's another one. We insist, Christian hedonists insist on the truth that
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.720]   navel-gazing is bad hedonism. In other words, if you sit in, if you go to an art
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:59.240]   gallery, you would want to enjoy the beauty of these masterpieces. And you
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.280]   stand in front of a Rembrandt, say, and you are constantly saying, "Okay, stomach, are
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.400]   you being turned? Okay, palms, are you beginning to sweat? Eyes, are you
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   beginning to flutter? Pulse, are you starting? You're not gonna see anything!
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.320]   You gotta forget your pulse, forget your stomach, forget your heart, and
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.560]   look at the painting!" Now, some people have said, "Therefore, stop talking
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.960]   about pursuing joy and just talking about pursue God." Well, it's not that
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480]   simple because there are ways to pursue God that don't honor him. And there are
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   ways to pursue righteousness that don't honor righteousness. If you pursue
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.200]   God out of a mere sense of "ought," like, "Okay, I ought to read my Bible, and I ought to
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:01.120]   go to church, and I ought to do this or that," God is not as honored as if you
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   come to him as the object of your desire. So I want to preserve both.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.540]   Naval-gazing is bad hedonism, and we ought to pursue joy in the painting. We
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.800]   ought to want to be delighted by the painting. Let me give you one more,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:27.200]   this short. I didn't see this early, Tony, say, what, 40 years ago, when I was first
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.600]   trying to formulate these things. We need, we Christian hedonists need to have a
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.680]   robust doctrine of self-denial and suffering. And so if you look at my
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.040]   writings after the first edition of Desiring God, which came along,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.760]   I've got a chapter on suffering in almost everything. And when people ask
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.720]   me, "How does this fit with self-denial?" I say, "Look, I totally believe in
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.760]   self-denial, because Jesus said, 'Whoever would save his life will lose it.'" But
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.000]   C.S. Lewis taught me this in that same sermon where I saw almost everything
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.760]   else at the beginning. He said, "Whenever you hear a promise or a command in the
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.520]   Bible, it always comes with a reward, and God doesn't treat us because we're
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.920]   seeking our satisfaction, but because we're too easily satisfied, because the
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.080]   rest of the verse says, 'Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.320]   Gospels will save it.'" So clearly Jesus is arguing, "You want to save your life,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   don't you?" "Yes, I do." "I'm a hedonist." "Well, good, I want you to be. Now lose it." In
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.240]   other words, here's the way I would put it, "Deny yourself tin so you can have
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.800]   gold. Deny yourself brackish gutter water so you can have a mountain spring. Deny
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   yourself hog gristle so you can have the finest steak." That's the
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.680]   point of a doctrine of self-denial. We must be willing to die, I mean really die,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:13.320]   because the steadfast love of the Lord, Psalm 63, is better than life. So maybe
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.840]   the sum of the matter is for Daniel, how does Christian hedonism keep joy
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:27.480]   from being an idol? Simply believe in the Bible and let the whole counsel of God
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:34.520]   inform your system. So I don't want to be more Christian hedonist than I
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.440]   am more biblical. Anytime somebody asks me a question where they see a part of
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.320]   the Bible that doesn't seem to fit with Christian hedonism, I am on that. I am
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.800]   on that because I want to be biblical more than I want to be faithful to any
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   system. Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
