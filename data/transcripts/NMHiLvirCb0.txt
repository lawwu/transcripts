[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   The big question for me in that timeline
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.980]   is why didn't we do it sooner?
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.160]   Why did it take so long?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.580]   Why did we wait until after 12,000 years ago,
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.260]   really after 10,000 years ago,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.900]   to start seeing the beginnings of civilization?
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.660]   The following is a conversation with Graham Hancock,
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.880]   a journalist and author who for over 30 years
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.500]   has explored the controversial possibility
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.460]   that there existed a lost civilization
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.120]   during the last ice age, and that it was destroyed
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.820]   in a global cataclysm some 12,000 years ago.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.300]   He is the presenter
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.060]   of the Netflix documentary series "Ancient Apocalypse,"
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.380]   the second season of which has just been released,
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.420]   and it's focused on the distant past of the Americas,
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.020]   a topic I recently discussed
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.720]   with the archeologist Ed Barnhart.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.780]   Let me say that Ed represents the kind of archeologist,
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780]   scholar I love talking to on the podcast,
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.820]   extremely knowledgeable, humble, open-minded,
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.660]   and respectful in disagreement.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.160]   I'll do many more podcasts on history,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.560]   including ancient history.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700]   Our distant past is full of mysteries,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.100]   and I find it truly exciting to explore those mysteries
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.260]   with people both on the inside
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260]   and the outside of the mainstream
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.980]   in the various disciplines involved.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.100]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.380]   in the description.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.300]   And now, dear friends, here's Graham Hancock.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.380]   Let's start with a big foundational idea
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620]   that you have about human history,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.700]   that there was an advanced ice age civilization
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.460]   that came before and perhaps seeded
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.320]   what people now call the six cradles of civilization,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.420]   Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China,
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.500]   Andes, and Mesoamerica.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.540]   So let's talk about this idea that you have.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.980]   Can you, at the highest possible level, describe it?
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.620]   - It would be better to describe it
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.940]   as a foundational sense of puzzlement and incompleteness
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.640]   in the story that we are taught about our past,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.780]   which envisages more or less,
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.400]   there have been a few ups and downs,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.820]   but more or less straightforward evolutionary progress.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.820]   We start out as hunter-foragers.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.300]   Then we become agriculturalists.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.420]   The hunter-forager phase could go back
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.220]   hundreds of thousands of years.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.260]   I mean, this is where it's also important to mention
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.980]   that anatomically modern humans were not the only humans.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220]   We had Neanderthals from, I don't know,
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.280]   400,000 years ago to about 40,000 years ago.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.380]   They were certainly human
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.300]   because anatomically modern humans interbred with them
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.380]   and we carry Neanderthal genes.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.340]   There were the Denisovans, maybe 300,000
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.980]   to perhaps even as recently as 30,000 years ago.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980]   And again, interbreeding took place.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.180]   They're obviously a human species.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.060]   So, you know, we've got this background
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.180]   of humans who didn't look quite like us.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.300]   And then we have anatomically modern humans.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.460]   And I think the earliest anatomically modern
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.940]   human skeletal remains are from Jebel Irhoud in Morocco
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.220]   and date to about 310,000 years ago.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.020]   So the question is what were our ancestors doing after that?
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.900]   And I think we can include the Neanderthals
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.420]   and the Denisovans in that general picture.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.520]   And why did it take so long?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.860]   This is one of the puzzles,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.620]   one of the questions that bother me.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.400]   Why did it take so long when we have creatures
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.500]   who are physically identical to us?
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.760]   We cannot actually weigh and measure their brains,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.220]   but from the work that's been done on the crania,
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.660]   it looks like they had the same brains
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.200]   that we do with the same wiring.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   So if we've been around for 300,000 plus years at least,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.740]   and if ultimately in our future was the process
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.420]   to create civilization or civilizations,
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.420]   why didn't it happen sooner?
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.580]   Why did it take so long?
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.860]   Why was it such a long time?
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.420]   Even the story of anatomically modern humans
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.140]   has kept on changing.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.300]   I remember a time when it was said
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.660]   that there hadn't been anatomically modern humans
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.820]   before 50,000 years ago.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.620]   And then it became 196,000 years ago
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.220]   with the findings in Ethiopia,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.180]   and then 310,000 years ago.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.180]   There's a lot of missing pieces in the puzzle there.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180]   But the big question for me in that timeline
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.820]   is why didn't we do it sooner?
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.020]   Why did it take so long?
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.380]   Why do we wait until after 12,000 years ago,
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.060]   really after 10,000 years ago,
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.660]   to start seeing the beginnings,
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.220]   what are selected as the beginnings of civilization
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.220]   in places like Turkey, for example?
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.060]   And then there's a relatively slow process
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.500]   of adopting agriculture.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.740]   And by 6,000 years ago,
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.740]   we see ancient Sumer emerging as a civilization.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.620]   And we're then in the pre-dynastic period
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.260]   in ancient Egypt as well, 6,000 years ago,
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.700]   beginning to see definite signs
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.260]   of what will become the dynastic civilization of Egypt
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.660]   about 5,000 years ago.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.500]   And interestingly, round about the same time,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.820]   you have the Indus Valley Civilization
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.460]   popping up out of nowhere.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.140]   And by the way, the Indus Valley Civilization
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.900]   was a lost civilization until the 1920s,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.460]   when railway workers accidentally stumbled
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.060]   across some ruins.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.020]   I've been to Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.460]   and these are extraordinarily beautifully
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.940]   centrally planned cities.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.980]   Clearly, they're the work
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.940]   of an already sophisticated civilization.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.180]   One of the things that strikes me
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.820]   about the Indus Valley Civilization
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.180]   is that we find a steatite seal
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.020]   of an individual seated in a recognizable yoga posture.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.460]   And that seal is 5,000 years old.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.660]   And the yoga posture is Mula Bandhasana,
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.100]   which involves a real contortion of the ankles
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.700]   and twisting the feet back.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.260]   It's an advanced yoga posture.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.140]   So there it is 5,000 years ago.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.220]   And that then raises the question,
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.860]   well, how long did yoga take to get to that place
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.780]   when it was already so advanced 5,000 years ago?
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.540]   What's the background to this?
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.300]   China, the Yellow River Civilization.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.980]   Again, it's around about the same period,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.260]   5,000 to 6,000 years ago.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.180]   You get these first signs of something happening.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.540]   So it's very odd that all around the world
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.500]   we have this sudden upsurge of civilization
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.340]   about 6,000 years ago,
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.460]   preceded by what seems like a natural evolutionary process
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.220]   that would lead to a civilization.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.300]   And yet certain ideas being carried down
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.940]   and manifested and expressed
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.900]   in many of these different civilizations.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.740]   I just find that whole idea very puzzling
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.660]   and very disturbing,
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.340]   especially when I look at this radical break
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.940]   that takes place in not just the human story,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.500]   but the story of all life on Earth,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.660]   which was the last great cataclysm
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.140]   that the Earth went through,
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.940]   which was the Younger Dryas event.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.500]   It was an extinction-level event.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.300]   That's when all the great megafauna
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.500]   of the Ice Age went extinct.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.140]   It's after that, it's after that event
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.100]   that we start seeing this,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.140]   what are taken to be the beginnings
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.380]   of the first gradual steps towards civilization.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.540]   We come out of the Upper Paleolithic
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.940]   as it's defined, the old end of the old Stone Age,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.460]   and into the Neolithic.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.820]   And that's when the wheels are supposedly set in motion
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.260]   to start civilization rolling.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.100]   But what happened before that?
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.460]   And why did that suddenly happen then?
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.620]   And I can't help feeling,
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.700]   and I've felt this for a very long while,
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.340]   that there are major missing pieces in our story.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.780]   It's often said that I'm claiming to have proved
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.980]   that there was an advanced lost civilization
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.940]   in the Ice Age.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.060]   And I am not claiming to have proved that.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.700]   That is a hypothesis that I am putting forward
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.420]   to answer some of the questions
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.380]   that I have about prehistory.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.300]   And I think it's worthwhile
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.820]   to inquire into those possibilities,
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.260]   because the Younger Dryas event
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.180]   was a massive global cataclysm,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.740]   whatever caused it.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.900]   And it's strange that just after it,
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.700]   we start seeing these first signs.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.780]   - So the current understanding in mainstream archeology
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.700]   is that after the Younger Dryas
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.420]   is when the civilizations popped up
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.700]   in different places of the globe
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.260]   with a lot of similarities,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.140]   but they popped up independently.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.180]   - Yeah, independently, and by coincidence.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.820]   And by coincidence, those big civilizations
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.220]   that we all remember as the first civilizations,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.020]   Sumer, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, China,
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.500]   they all pop up at pretty much the same time.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.740]   That is the mainstream view.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.940]   - And they don't just pop up,
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.340]   they kind of build up gradually.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.660]   First, there's some settlements.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.540]   - Oh, definitely, yes.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.860]   - And then there's different dynamics
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.820]   of how they build up,
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   and the role of agriculture in that is also not obvious,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.540]   but it's just, there's first a kind of settlement,
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.580]   a stabilization of where the people are living,
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.380]   then they start using agriculture,
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.020]   then they start getting urban centers
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.860]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.540]   - It seems like an entirely reasonable argument.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.300]   Everything about that makes sense.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.660]   There is no doubt that you're seeing evolutionary progress,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.460]   social evolution taking place in those thousands of years
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.020]   before Sumer emerges.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.700]   But what's happening now,
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.100]   I spent much of the '90s and the late 1980s
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.460]   investigating this issue of a lost civilization.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.340]   I wrote a series of books about it.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.100]   But by 2002, when I published a book called "Underworld,"
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   which was the most massive and most heavy book
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.780]   that I've ever written,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.020]   because I was writing very defensively at the time,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.260]   by the time I finished that book,
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.980]   my wife, Santha, and I spent seven years
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.460]   scuba diving all around the world,
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.180]   looking for structures underwater,
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.020]   often led by local fishermen or local divers,
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.820]   to anomalies that they'd seen underwater.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.340]   By the time that book was finished,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.700]   I thought, actually, I've done this story,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.540]   I've walked the walk,
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.580]   I really don't have much more to say about it.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.140]   And I turned in another direction
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.620]   and I wrote a book called "Supernatural,
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.700]   "Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind,"
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.260]   recently retitled "Visionary."
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.700]   And that was about the role of,
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.980]   fundamentally about the role of psychedelics
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.100]   in the evolution of human culture.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.540]   And I didn't think that I would go back
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.700]   to the lost civilization issue,
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.180]   but Gobekli Tepe in Turkey kept on forcing itself upon me.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.620]   The more and more discoveries there,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.020]   the 11,600 year date from enclosure D,
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.220]   which has the two largest megalithic pillars.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.260]   And I reached a point where I realized
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.180]   I have to get back in, I have to get back in the water,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.980]   and I have to investigate this again.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.900]   And Gobekli Tepe was a game changer,
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.060]   but I think it's a game changer for everything,
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.260]   because Gobekli Tepe, the extraordinary nature of it,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.740]   we're looking at a major megalithic site,
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.820]   which is at least 5,500 years older
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.340]   than, say, Gigantia in Malta,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.340]   which was previously considered
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.580]   to be the oldest megalithic site in the world.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.060]   And this led, of course,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.380]   to a huge amount of interest and attention,
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.940]   both from the Turkish government,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.820]   who see the potential tourism potential
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.380]   of having the world's oldest megalithic site,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.540]   and from archeologists.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.740]   And this, in turn, has led to exploration and excavation
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.820]   throughout the region.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.060]   And what they're finding throughout that whole region
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.500]   around Gobekli Tepe,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.740]   and going down into Syria
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.860]   and further down into the Jordan Valley,
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.020]   as far as Jericho,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.620]   and even across a bit of the Mediterranean into Cyprus,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.260]   is what Turkish archeologists
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.060]   are now calling the Tas Tepeler civilization.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.620]   They're calling it a civilization,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.580]   the Stonehills civilization,
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.380]   with very definite identifying characteristics,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.340]   semi-subterranean circular structures,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.900]   the use of T-shaped megalithic pillars,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.820]   sometimes not anywhere near as big
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.660]   as those at Gobekli Tepe.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.100]   It's clear that Gobekli Tepe now
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   was not the beginning of this process.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.260]   It was actually, in a way, the end of this process.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.460]   It was the summation of everything
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.700]   that that Stonehills civilization had achieved.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.500]   But what is becoming clear is that this is a period
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.580]   between before the foundation of Gobekli Tepe.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.500]   As far as we know, that date of 11,600 years ago
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.740]   is the oldest date for Gobekli Tepe.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.260]   But of course, there's a lot of Gobekli Tepe
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.580]   still underground.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.540]   So we can't say for sure that that's the oldest,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.220]   but it's the oldest so far excavated.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.620]   What we're seeing is that in that whole region around there,
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.500]   there was something was in motion,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.460]   and it began to go into motion
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.860]   round about the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.220]   And this is where these two dates are really important.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.060]   The Younger Dryas, I'll round the figures off,
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.780]   begins around 12,800 years ago,
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.780]   and it ends around 11,600 years ago.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.580]   So Gobekli Tepe's construction date,
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.100]   if it is 11,600 years ago,
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.700]   if they don't find older materials,
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.380]   marks the end of the Younger Dryas.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.660]   But the beginning of the Younger Dryas,
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.300]   we're already seeing the stirrings of the kind of culture
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.420]   that manifests in full form at Gobekli Tepe.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.900]   And after the construction of Gobekli Tepe,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.300]   in fact, even during the construction of Gobekli Tepe,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.020]   we see agriculture beginning to be adopted.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.900]   The people who created Gobekli Tepe
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.500]   were all hunter-foragers at the beginning.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.460]   But by the time Gobekli Tepe was finished,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.220]   and it was definitely deliberately finished,
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.700]   closed off, closed down, deliberately buried,
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.540]   covered with earth, covered with rubble,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.940]   and then topped off with a hill,
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.380]   which is why Gobekli Tepe is called what it is.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.700]   Gobekli Tepe means pot-bellied hill,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.500]   or the hill of the navel.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.380]   For a long time, Gobekli Tepe was thought to be just a hill
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.060]   that looked a bit like a pot belly.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.620]   - Can you say how it was discovered?
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.660]   I think this is one of the most fascinating things
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.660]   on earth, period.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.780]   So maybe can you say what it is and how it was discovered?
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.280]   - Well, Gobekli Tepe is, first of all,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.300]   the oldest fully elaborated megalithic site
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.260]   that we know of anywhere in the world.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.740]   It doesn't mean the older ones won't be found,
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   but it is the oldest so far found.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.040]   The part of the site that's been excavated,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.820]   which is a tiny percentage of the whole site,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.380]   we do know, my first visit to Gobekli Tepe was in 2013,
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.100]   and Dr. Klaus Schmidt, the late Dr. Klaus Schmidt,
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.140]   who died a year later, was very generous to me
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.300]   and showed me around the site for over a period
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.860]   of three days, and he explained to me
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.100]   that they've already used ground-penetrating radar
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.380]   on the site, and they know that there's much more
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.300]   Gobekli Tepe still underground.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.620]   So anything is possible in terms of the dating
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.460]   of Gobekli Tepe.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.820]   But what we have at the moment is a series
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.420]   of almost circular, but not quite circular enclosures,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.500]   which are walled with relatively small stones,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.260]   and then inside them, you have pairs of megalithic pillars.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   And the archetypal part of that site is enclosure D,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.680]   which contains the two largest upright megaliths,
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.860]   about 18 feet tall, and reckoned to weigh somewhere
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.700]   in the range of 20 tons, if I have my memory correct.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.280]   They're substantial, hefty pieces of stone.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.380]   It isn't some kind of extraordinary feat
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.900]   to create a 20-foot tall or 20-ton megalith,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.500]   nor is it an extraordinary feat to move it.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.460]   There's nothing magical or really weird about that.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.120]   Human beings can do that and always have.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.220]   Besides, the quarry for the megaliths is right there.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.700]   It's within 200 meters of the main enclosure.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.620]   So that's not a mystery, but the mystery is why suddenly
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.760]   this new form of architecture, this massive,
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.280]   massive megalithic pillars appear.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.200]   And the pillars, one of the things that interests me
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.040]   about the pillars is their alignment.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.840]   And there is good work that's been done,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   which suggests that enclosure D aligns
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   to the rising of the star Sirius.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.680]   And the rising points of the star Sirius appear to be mapped
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.480]   by the other enclosures, which are all oriented
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.460]   in slightly different directions.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.240]   It was the work entirely of hunter-foragers,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.880]   but by the time Gobekli Tepe was completed,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.480]   agriculture was being introduced and was taking place there.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.040]   Now you asked how Gobekli Tepe was found.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.840]   The answer to that is that there was a survey
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.720]   of that pot-bellied hill in the 1960s
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.680]   by some American archeologists.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.120]   And they were looking, absolutely looking
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.680]   for Stone Age material, for material from the Paleolithic.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.360]   And they had found some Paleolithic flints,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.860]   upper Paleolithic flints around there,
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.520]   so it looked like a good place to look.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.480]   But then they noticed, sticking out of the side of the hill,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.880]   some very finely cut stone, bits of very large
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.760]   and very finely cut stone.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.120]   And looking at that, the workmanship was so good
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.140]   that those archeologists were confident
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.480]   that it had nothing to do with the Stone Age.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.720]   And they thought they were looking
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.040]   at perhaps some Byzantine remains.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.580]   And they abandoned the site and never looked at it further.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.760]   And it wasn't until the German Archeological Institute
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.360]   got involved, and particularly Klaus Schmidt,
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.080]   who I think was a genius, had real insight into this
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.480]   and started to dig at Gobekli Tepe
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.960]   that they realized what they'd found,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.600]   that they'd found potentially
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.720]   the oldest megalithic site in the world.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.160]   And they'd found it at a place where agriculture,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.240]   according to the established historical timeline,
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.000]   that's where agriculture, at any rate,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.720]   in Europe and Western Asia begins.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.520]   It begins in Anatolia, in Turkey,
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.600]   and then it gradually disseminates westward from there.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.440]   - And yet the understanding is
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.920]   it was created by hunter-gatherers.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.440]   - It was created by hunter-gatherers, yeah.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.080]   There was no agriculture 11,600 years ago in Gobekli Tepe.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.440]   But by the time Gobekli Tepe was decommissioned,
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.820]   and I use that word deliberately,
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.220]   was closed down and buried,
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.220]   agriculture was all around it.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.940]   And this was agriculture of people
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.500]   who knew how to cultivate plants.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.020]   - Do we have an understanding when it was turned into a,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.980]   if I could say, a time capsule,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.700]   so protected by forming a mound around it?
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.380]   Is it around that similar time?
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.220]   - It stood from roughly 11,600 years ago
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.160]   to about 10,400 years ago, to about 8,400 BC.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.580]   So around 1,200 years, it was there,
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.100]   and it continued to be elaborated as a site.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.520]   And while it was being elaborated as a site,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   we see agriculture, I'm gonna use the word, being introduced.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.500]   There'd been no sign of it before, and suddenly it's there.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.140]   And to me, that's another of the mysteries
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.540]   about Gobekli Tepe.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.820]   And then, with the new work that's being done,
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.860]   we realize that it's part of a much wider phenomenon,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.460]   which spreads across an enormous distance.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.620]   And the puzzling thing is that after Gobekli Tepe,
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.420]   there almost seems to be a decline.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.300]   Things fall down again.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.620]   And then we enter this long, slow process
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.740]   of the Neolithic, thousands of years,
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.460]   gradual developments, until we come
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.380]   to ancient Sumer and Mesopotamia.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.460]   But agriculture has taken a firm root by then.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.820]   Actually, one other thing, I'll just say this in passing.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.260]   When I talk about a lost civilization,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.460]   introducing ideas to people,
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.580]   I'm often accused of stealing credit
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.560]   from the indigenous people who had those ideas
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.740]   in the first place.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.940]   So I do find it slightly hypocritical
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.420]   that archeology fully accepts that the idea
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.740]   of agriculture was introduced to Western Europe from Turkey,
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.620]   and that Western Europeans didn't invent agriculture.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.500]   It was absolutely introduced by Anatolian farmers
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.860]   who traveled west.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.900]   So the notion of dissemination of ideas
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.820]   perhaps shouldn't be so annoying to archeologists as it is.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.860]   - And perhaps we should also state,
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.960]   if we look at the entirety of history of hominids,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.300]   humans or hominids have been explorers.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.320]   I didn't even know this when I was preparing for this,
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.460]   looking at Homo erectus.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.060]   1.9 million years ago, almost right away,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.940]   they spread out through the whole world.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.180]   And we Homo sapiens evolved from them.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.460]   And we should also mention,
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.620]   since we're talking about controversial debates going on,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.140]   as I understand, there's still debates
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.700]   about the dynamics of all that was going on there,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.260]   like we mentioned in Africa,
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.940]   that it's, I think the current understanding,
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   we didn't come from one particular point of Africa,
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.020]   that there's multiple locations.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.900]   - This is the out of Africa theory.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.940]   I think it's more than a theory.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.020]   It's really strongly evidenced.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.240]   - Why? Because we're part of the great ape family
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.460]   and it's an African family.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.820]   There's no doubt that human beings,
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.540]   our deep origins are in Africa.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.900]   But then there, as you rightly say,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.380]   there were these very early migrations out of Africa
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.580]   by species that are likely ancestral
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.080]   to anatomically modern humans,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.220]   including definitely Homo erectus
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.300]   and the astonishingly distant travels that they undertook.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   Yes, I think there is an urge to explore in all of humanity.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.900]   I think there is an urge to find out
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.160]   what's around the next corner,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.420]   what's over the brow of the next hill.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.700]   And I think that goes very deep into human character.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.960]   And I think it was being manifested
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.980]   in those early adventures of people who left Africa
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.400]   and traveled all around the world.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.220]   And then settling in different parts of the world,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.540]   I think a lot of anatomically modern human evolution
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.940]   took place outside Africa as well, not only in Africa.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.160]   - So I guess the general puzzlement that you're filled with
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   is given that these creatures explore and spread
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.180]   and try out different environments,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.380]   why did it take hundreds of thousands of years
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.860]   for them to develop complicated society settlements?
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:52.980]   - That's the first big question.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.020]   Why did it take so long?
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.300]   And that raises in my mind a hypothesis, a possibility.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.700]   Maybe it didn't take so long.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.220]   Maybe things were happening that we haven't yet got hold of
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.220]   in the archeological record which await to be discovered.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.460]   And of course, there are huge parts of the world
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.220]   that have not been studied at all by archeology.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.140]   But the fact that huge parts of the world
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   have not been studied at all by archeology
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.860]   is not on its own enough to suggest
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.860]   that we're missing a chapter in the human story.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.420]   The reason that I come to that
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.020]   isn't only puzzlement about that 300,000 year gap.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.420]   It's also to do with the fact that there's common iconography
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.820]   there's common myths and traditions
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.680]   and there's common spiritual ideas
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.220]   that are found all around the world.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   And they're found amongst cultures
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.580]   that are geographically distant from one another
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.300]   and that are also distant from one another in time.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.540]   They don't necessarily occur at the same time.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.500]   And this is where I think that archeology
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.380]   is perhaps desperately needing a history of ideas
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.820]   as well as just a history of things.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.820]   Because an idea can manifest again and again
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.060]   throughout the human story.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.900]   So there are particular issues, for example,
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.120]   the notion of the afterlife destiny of the soul.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.380]   What happens to us when we die?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.460]   And believe me, when you reach my age,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.260]   that's something you do think about what happens.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.260]   I used to feel immortal when I was in my 40s,
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.340]   but now that I'm 74, I definitely know that I'm not.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.160]   Well, it would be natural for human beings
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.540]   all around the world to have that same feeling,
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.940]   that same idea.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.780]   But why would they all decide
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.720]   that what happens to the soul after death
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.380]   is that it makes a leap to the heavens, to the Milky Way,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.420]   that it makes a journey along the Milky Way,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.780]   that there it is confronted by challenges,
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.900]   by monsters, by closed gates.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.540]   The course of the life that that person has lived
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.580]   will determine their destiny in that afterlife journey.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.740]   And this idea, the path of souls,
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.420]   the Milky Way is called the path of souls.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.420]   It's very strongly found in the Americas,
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.500]   right from South America through Mexico
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.500]   through into North America.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.060]   But it's also found in ancient Egypt,
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.500]   in ancient India, in ancient Mesopotamia, the same idea.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.060]   And I don't feel that that can be a coincidence.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.580]   I feel that what we're looking at
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.540]   is an inheritance of an idea,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.500]   a legacy that's been passed down from a remote common source
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.900]   to cultures all around the world.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.020]   And then has taken on a life of its own
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.380]   within those cultures.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.500]   So the remote common source would explain
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.540]   both the similarities and the differences
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.220]   in the expression of these ideas.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.020]   The other thing, very puzzling thing,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.500]   is the sequence of numbers
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.340]   that are a result of the precession of the equinoxes.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.140]   At least I think that's the best theory to explain them.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:03.340]   Here, I think it's important to pay tribute
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.780]   to the work of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.060]   Giorgio de Santillana was professor of history of science,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.420]   actually at MIT, where you're based, back in the '60s.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.180]   And Hertha von Deschend was professor
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.620]   of the history of science at Frankfurt University.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.340]   And they wrote an immense book in the 1960s
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.540]   called "Hamlet's Mill."
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.540]   And "Hamlet's Mill" differs very strongly
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.020]   from established opinion
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.700]   on the issue of the phenomenon of precession.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.820]   And I'll explain what precession is in a moment.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.540]   Generally, it's held that it was the Greeks
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.780]   who discovered the precession.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.420]   And the dating on that is put back not very far,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.620]   maybe 2,300 years ago or so.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.780]   Santillana and von Deschend are pointing out
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.580]   that knowledge of precession is much, much older than that,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.140]   thousands of years older than that.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.500]   And they do actually trace it,
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.740]   I think I'm quoting them pretty much correctly,
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.180]   to some almost unbelievable ancestor civilization.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.060]   Reading that book was one of the several reasons
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.660]   that I got into this mystery in the first place.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.900]   Okay, now, the precession of the equinoxes,
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.260]   to give it its full name,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:23.380]   results from the fact that our planet is the viewing platform
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.660]   from which we observe the stars.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.740]   And our planet, of course, is rotating on its own axis
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.700]   at roughly 1,000 miles an hour at the equator.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.100]   But what's less obvious is that
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.500]   it's also wobbling on its axis.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.260]   And so if you imagine the extended north pole of the Earth
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.940]   pointing up at the sky,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.980]   in our time, it's pointing at the star Polaris,
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.860]   and that is our pole star.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.500]   But Polaris has not always been the pole star,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.100]   precisely because of this wobble on the axis of the Earth.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.140]   Other stars have occupied the pole position,
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.460]   and sometimes the extended north pole of the Earth
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.500]   points at empty space, there is no pole star.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.260]   That's one of the obvious results
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.020]   of the wobble on the Earth's axis.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.540]   The other one is that there are 12
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.620]   well-known constellations in our time,
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.980]   the 12 constellations of the zodiac,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.900]   that lie along what is referred to as the path of the sun.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.980]   The Earth is orbiting the sun,
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.900]   and we are seeing what's behind it,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   what's in direct line with the sun in our view.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.580]   And the zodiacal constellations
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.660]   all lie along the path of the sun.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.420]   So at different times of the year,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.180]   the sun will rise against the background
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.380]   of a particular zodiacal constellation.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.140]   Today, we live in the age of Pisces,
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.180]   and it's definitely not an accident
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.620]   that the early Christians used the fish as their symbol.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.020]   This is another area where I differ from archeology.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.660]   I think the constellations of the zodiac
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.500]   were recognized as such much earlier than we suppose.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.620]   Anyway, to get to the point,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.580]   the key marker of the year,
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.060]   certainly in the northern hemisphere,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.380]   was the spring equinox.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.060]   This was, the question was,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.660]   what constellation is rising behind the sun?
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.380]   What constellation is housing the sun
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.820]   at dawn on the spring equinox?
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.180]   Right now, it's Pisces.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.220]   In another 150 years or so, it'll be Aquarius.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.060]   We do live in the dawning of the age of Aquarius.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.660]   Back in the time of the late ancient Egyptians,
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.340]   it was Aries, going back to the time of Ramesses or before.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.980]   Before that, it was Taurus, and so on and so forth.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.420]   It's backwards through the zodiac
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.420]   until 12,500 years ago, you come to the age of Leo
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.260]   when the constellation of Leo
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.980]   houses the sun on the spring equinox.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.260]   Now, this process unfolds very, very, very, very slowly.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.460]   The whole cycle, and it is a cycle,
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.300]   it repeats itself roughly every 26,000 years.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.180]   Put a more exact figure on it, 25,920 years.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.500]   That may be a convention.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.820]   Some scholars would say it was a bit less than that,
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.180]   a bit more, but you're talking fractions.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.940]   It's in that area, 25,920 years.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:10.940]   To observe it, you really need more than one human lifetime
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.140]   because it unfolds very, very slowly
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.660]   at a rate of one degree every 72 years.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.420]   The parallel that I often give
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.820]   is hold your finger up to the horizon, the distant horizon.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.580]   The movement in one lifetime in a period of 72 years
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.280]   is about the width of your finger.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.140]   It's not impossible to notice in a lifetime,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.300]   but it's difficult.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.100]   You gotta pass it on.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.460]   And what seems to have happened
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.860]   is that some ancient culture,
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.820]   the culture that Santillana and Vondesan
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.620]   call some almost unbelievable ancestor culture,
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   worked out the entire process of precession
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.340]   and selected the key numbers of precession,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.300]   of which the most important number,
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.220]   the governing number, is the number 72.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:59.080]   But we also have numbers related to the number 72.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.620]   72 plus 36 is 108.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.900]   108 divided by two is 54.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.700]   These numbers are also found in mythology
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.720]   all around the world.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.780]   There were 72 conspirators
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.660]   who were involved in killing the god Osiris in ancient Egypt
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   and nailing him up in a wooden coffer
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.900]   and dumping him in the Nile.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.460]   There are 432,000 in the Rig Vesa.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.740]   432,000 is a multiple of 72.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.800]   And at Angkor in Cambodia, for example,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.300]   you have the bridge to Angkor Thom.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.780]   And on that bridge, you have figures on both sides,
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.780]   sculpted figures, which are holding the body of a serpent.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.340]   That serpent is Vazuki.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.580]   And what they're doing is they're churning the milky ocean.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.420]   It's the same metaphor of churning and turning
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.520]   that's defined in the story of "Hamlet's Mill"
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.260]   of Amlodi's Mill.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.380]   There are 54 on each side.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.380]   54 plus 54 is 108.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.460]   108 is 72 plus 36.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.100]   It's a precessional number,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.860]   according to the work that Santayana and Vandesan did.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.780]   And the fascination with this number system
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   and its discovery all around the world
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   is one of the puzzles that intrigue me
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.220]   and suggest to me that we are looking at ancestral knowledge
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.900]   that was passed down and probably was passed down
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.380]   from a specific single common source at one time,
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.300]   but then was spread out very, very widely around the world.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.740]   - So one of the defining ways that you approach
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.220]   the study of human history
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.220]   that I think contrasts with mainstream archeology
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.260]   is you take this sort of astronomical symbolism
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.100]   and the relationship between humans
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.140]   and the stars very seriously.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.180]   - I do, as I believe the ancients did.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.100]   - I think it's important to sort of consider
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.640]   what humans would have thought about back then.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.140]   Now we have a lot of distractions.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.220]   We have social media.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.900]   We can watch videos on YouTube and whatever.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.700]   But back then, especially before sort of electricity,
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.580]   the stars is like the sexiest thing to talk about.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.900]   - There's no light pollution.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.740]   - There's no light pollution.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.660]   So there's, in your space- - There's the majesty
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.500]   of the heavens.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.820]   - Every single night,
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.060]   you're spending looking up at the stars.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.700]   And you can imagine there's a lot of sort of status value
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.780]   to be the guy who's very good at studying the stars
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.660]   and sort of the scientists of the day.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.180]   And I'm sure there's going to be these geniuses that emerge.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.560]   They're able to do two things.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.300]   One, tell stories about the gods or whatever
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.740]   based on the stars.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.860]   And then also, as we'll probably talk about,
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.180]   use the stars practically for navigation, for example.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.220]   - Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.300]   - So like, it makes sense that the stars
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   had a primal importance for the ideas of the times,
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:07.320]   for the status, for religious explorations.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.820]   - It was an ever-present reality.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.140]   - Yes. - And it was bright.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.560]   And it was brilliant. - Yeah.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.980]   - And it was full of lights.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.260]   It's inconceivable that the ancients
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.760]   would not have paid attention to it.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.660]   It was an overwhelming presence.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.260]   And that's one of the reasons why I'm really confident
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.700]   that the constellations that we now recognize
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   as the constellations of the zodiac
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.080]   were recognized much earlier.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.460]   Because it's hard to miss when you pay attention to the sky
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.420]   that the sun, over the course of the solar year,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.060]   is month by month rising against the background
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.340]   of different constellations.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.580]   And then there's a much longer process,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.060]   the process of precession,
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.180]   which takes that journey backwards.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:48.220]   And where we have a period of 2,160 years
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.280]   for each sign of the zodiac.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.180]   I think it would have been hard
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.620]   for the ancients to have missed that.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.060]   They might not have identified the constellations
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.140]   in exactly the same way we do today.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.860]   That may well be a Babylonian or Greek convention.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.340]   But that the constellations were there,
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.660]   I think was very clear.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.220]   And that they were special constellations,
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.580]   unlike other ones higher up in the sky,
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.060]   which were not on the path of the sun
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.460]   that people paid attention to.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.800]   - Well, but detecting the precession of the equinox is hard.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.020]   Because especially, they don't have any writing systems,
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.420]   they don't have any mathematical systems.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.460]   So everything is told through words.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.900]   - Yeah, and they have,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.180]   let's not underestimate oral traditions.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.900]   Oral traditions, that's something we've lost
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.340]   in our culture today.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   One of the things that happens with the written word
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.600]   is that you gradually lose your memory.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.620]   Actually, there's a nice story from ancient Egypt
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.460]   about the god Thoth, the god of wisdom,
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.460]   who is very proud of himself because he has invented writing.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.100]   Look at this gift, he says to a mythical pharaoh
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.500]   of that time, look at the gift
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.680]   that I am giving humanity, writing.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.420]   This is a wonderful thing.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.200]   It'll enable you to preserve so much
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.340]   that you would otherwise lose.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.300]   And the pharaoh in this story replies to him,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.980]   no, you have not given us a wonderful gift.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.040]   You have destroyed the art of memory.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.380]   We will forget everything.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.180]   Words will roam free around the world,
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.620]   not accompanied by any wise advice
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.020]   to set them into context.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.580]   And actually, that's a very interesting point.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.020]   And we do know that cultures
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.740]   that still do have oral traditions
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.140]   are able to preserve information
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.980]   for very long periods of time.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.140]   One thing I think is clear in any time,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.940]   in any period of history, is human beings love stories.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.700]   We love great stories.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.620]   And one way to preserve information
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   is to encode it, embed it in a great story.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.860]   And so carefully done that actually it doesn't matter
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.460]   whether the storyteller knows
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.420]   that they're passing on that information or not.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.500]   The story itself is the vehicle.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.700]   And as long as it's repeated faithfully,
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.820]   the information contained within it will be passed on.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   And I do think this is part of the story
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.380]   of the preservation of knowledge.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.300]   - But that's one of the reasons
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.500]   that you take myths seriously.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.740]   - I take them very seriously.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.620]   And the other, there's many reasons,
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.620]   but I can't help being deeply impressed
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:21.060]   and deeply puzzled by the worldwide tradition
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.020]   of a global cataclysm within human memory.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.220]   I mean, we know that, we know scientifically
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.800]   that there have been many, many cataclysms in the past
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.320]   going back millions of years.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.780]   I mean, the best known one, of course,
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.700]   is the KPG event as it's now called
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.620]   that made the dinosaurs extinct 65 million
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.460]   or 66 million years ago.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.460]   But has there been such a cataclysm
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.540]   in the lifetime of the human species?
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.100]   Yeah, the Mount Toba eruption
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.260]   about 70,000 years ago was pretty bad.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.740]   But a global cataclysm, the Younger Dryas
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.700]   really ticks all the boxes as a worldwide disaster,
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.000]   which definitely involved sea level rise,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.860]   both at the beginning and at the end of the Younger Dryas.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.140]   It definitely involved the swallowing up of lands
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.300]   that previously had been above water.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.600]   And I think it's an excellent candidate
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.140]   for this worldwide tradition of a global cataclysm
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.700]   of which one of, but not the only,
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.220]   distinguishing characteristics was a flood,
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.700]   an enormous flood, and the submergence of lands
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.840]   that had previously been above water, underwater.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.780]   The fact that this story is found all around the world
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.540]   suggests to me that the archeological explanation is,
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.500]   look, people suffer local floods all the time.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.900]   I mean, as we're talking, there's flooding in Florida.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.020]   But I don't think anybody in Florida
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.740]   is going to make the mistake of believing
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.220]   that that's a global flood.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.620]   They know it's local.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.740]   But that's the argument largely of archeology
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.020]   dealing with the flood myths,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.400]   or that some local population
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.660]   experienced a nasty local flooding event,
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.060]   and they decided to say that it affected the whole world.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.360]   I'm not persuaded by that,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.020]   particularly since we know there was a nasty epoch,
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.200]   the Younger Dryas, when flooding did occur,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   and when the Earth was subjected to events
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.600]   cataclysmic enough to extinguish entirely
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.440]   the megafauna of the Ice Age.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.960]   - So there is the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.200]   that provides an explanation
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.420]   of what happened during this period
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.340]   that resulted in such a rapid environmental change.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.720]   So can you explain this hypothesis?
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.160]   - Yes.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.620]   The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, YDIH for short,
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.280]   is not a lunatic fringe theory,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.780]   as its opponents often attempt to write it off.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.200]   It's the work of more than 60 major scientists
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.340]   working across many different disciplines,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.860]   including archeology, and including oceanography as well.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.980]   They are collectively puzzled
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.700]   by the sudden onset of the Younger Dryas,
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.980]   and by the fact that it is accompanied 12,800 years ago
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.020]   by a distinct layer in the Earth.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.580]   You can see it most clearly
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.620]   at Murray Springs in Arizona, for example.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.900]   You can see it's about the width of a human hand,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.660]   and there's a draw there
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.100]   that's been cut by flash flooding at some time.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.620]   And that draw has revealed the sides of the draw.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.540]   And you can see the cross section,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.180]   and in the cross section is this distinct dark layer
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.580]   that runs through the Earth.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.980]   And it contains evidence of wildfires.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.420]   There's a lot of soot in it.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.620]   There are also nanodiamonds in it.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.060]   There is shocked quartz in it.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.480]   There is quartz that's been melted at temperatures
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.880]   in excess of 2,200 degrees centigrade.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.980]   There are carbon microspherules.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.420]   All of these are proxies for some kind of cosmic impact.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.580]   I talked a moment ago about the extinction of the dinosaurs.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.780]   Lewis and Walter Alvarez,
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.700]   who made that incredible discovery,
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.540]   initially their discovery was based entirely
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.500]   on impact proxies, just as the Younger Dryases.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.580]   There was no crater.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.360]   And for a long time, they were disbelieved
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.380]   because they couldn't produce a crater.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.180]   But when they finally did produce that deeply buried
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.660]   Chicxulub crater, that's when people started to say,
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.960]   "Yeah, they have to be right."
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.580]   But they weren't relying on the crater.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.700]   They were relying on the impact proxies.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.300]   And they're the same impact proxies that we find
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.240]   in what's called the Younger Dryas boundary layer
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.220]   all around the world.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.980]   So it's the fact that at the moment
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.580]   when the Earth tips into a radical climate shift,
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.040]   it's been warming up for at least 2,000 years
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.300]   before 12,800 years ago.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.900]   People at the time must have been feeling
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.440]   a great sense of relief.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.700]   We've been living through this really cold time,
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.920]   but it's getting better.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.060]   Things are getting better.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.860]   And then suddenly around 12,800 years ago,
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.240]   some might say 12,860 years ago,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.460]   there's a massive global plunge in global temperatures.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:09.100]   And the world suddenly gets as cold as it was
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.300]   at the peak of the Ice Age.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.020]   And it's almost literally overnight.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.700]   It's very, very, very rapid.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.600]   Normally in an epoch when the Earth is going into a freeze,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.060]   you would not expect sea levels to rise,
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.280]   but there is a sea level rise, a sudden one,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.980]   right at the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.820]   And then you have this long frozen period
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.140]   from 12,800 to 11,600 years ago.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.300]   And then equally dramatically and equally suddenly,
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.940]   the Younger Dryas comes to an end
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.940]   and the world very rapidly warms up
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.640]   and you have a recognized pulse of meltwater at that time
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.500]   as the last of the glaciers collapse into the sea
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.820]   called Meltwater Pulse 1B, around about 11,600 years ago.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   So this is a period which is very tightly defined.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   It's a period when we know
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.860]   that human populations were grievously disturbed.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.920]   That's when the so-called Clovis culture of North America
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.460]   vanished entirely from the record during the Younger Dryas.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.740]   And it's the time when the mammoths
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.020]   and the saber-toothed tigers
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.680]   vanished from the record as well.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.900]   - Is there a good understanding
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.480]   of what happened geologically,
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.960]   whether there was an impact or not?
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.480]   Like what explains this huge dip in temperature
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.160]   and then rise in temperature?
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.960]   - The abrupt cessation
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.680]   of the global meridional overturning circulation
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.240]   of which the Gulf Stream is the best known part.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.640]   The main theory that's been put forward up to now,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.900]   and I don't dispute that theory at all,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.700]   is that the sudden freeze was caused
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.180]   by the cutting off of the Gulf Stream, basically,
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.540]   which is part of the central heating system of our planet.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.120]   So no wonder it became cold.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.260]   But what's not really been addressed before
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.700]   is why that happened, why the Gulf Stream was cut,
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.500]   why a sudden pulse of meltwater went into the world ocean,
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.980]   and it was so much of it, and it was so cold
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.500]   that it actually stopped the Gulf Stream in its tracks.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.700]   And that's where the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:13.380]   offers a very elegant and very satisfactory solution
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.540]   to the problem.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.980]   Now, the hypothesis, of course, is broader than that.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.860]   Amongst the scientists working on it are, for example,
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.300]   Bill Napier, an astrophysicist and astronomer.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.000]   They have assembled a great deal of evidence
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.240]   which suggests that the culprit
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.900]   in the Younger Dryas Impact event or events
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.660]   was what we now call the Taurid Meteor Stream,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.140]   which the Earth still passes through twice a year.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.620]   It's now about 30 million kilometers wide,
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.300]   takes the Earth a couple of days
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.220]   to pass through it on its orbit.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.740]   It passed through it in June,
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.220]   and it passes through it at the end of October.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.440]   The suggestion is that the Taurid Meteor Stream
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   is the end product of a very large comet
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.380]   that entered the solar system
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.180]   round about 20,000 years ago,
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.820]   came in from the Oort cloud,
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.980]   got trapped by the gravity of the sun,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.740]   and went into orbit around the sun,
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.000]   an orbit that crossed the orbit of the Earth.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.460]   However, when it was one object,
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.140]   the likelihood of a collision with the Earth
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.060]   was extremely small.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.820]   But as it started to do what all comets do,
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.020]   which was to break up into multiple fragments,
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.220]   'cause these are chunks of rock held together by ice,
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.600]   and as they warm up, they split and disintegrate
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.060]   and break into pieces.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.060]   As it passed through that,
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.380]   its debris stream became larger and larger
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.020]   and wider and wider.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.620]   And the theory is that 12,800 years ago,
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.460]   the Earth passed through a particularly dense part
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.220]   of the Taurid Meteor Stream
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.900]   and was hit by multiple impacts all around the planet,
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.660]   certainly from the west of North America
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.460]   as far east as Syria.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.180]   And that we are by and large not talking
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.380]   about impacts that would have caused craters,
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.620]   although there certainly were some.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.660]   We're talking about airbursts.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:13.660]   When an object is 100 or 150 meters in diameter,
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.740]   and it's coming in very fast into the Earth's atmosphere,
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.140]   it is very unlikely to reach the Earth.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.180]   It's going to blow up in the sky.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.300]   And the best known recent example of that
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.140]   is the Tunguska event in Siberia,
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.980]   which took place on the 30th of June, 1908.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.740]   The Tunguska event was, nobody disputes,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.300]   it was definitely an airburst of a cometary fragment.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.100]   And the date is interesting because the 30th of June
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.180]   is the height of the Beta Taurids.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.460]   It's one of the two times when the Earth
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.820]   is going through the Taurid Meteor Stream.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.740]   Well, luckily that part of Siberia wasn't inhabited,
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.660]   but 2,000 square miles of forest were destroyed.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.780]   If that had happened over a major city,
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.180]   we would all be thinking very hard
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.780]   about objects out of the Taurid Meteor Stream
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.060]   and about the risk of cosmic impact.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.620]   So the suggestion is that it wasn't one impact,
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.380]   it wasn't two impacts, it wasn't three impacts,
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.740]   it was hundreds of airbursts all around the planet,
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.620]   coupled with a number of bigger objects,
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.140]   which the scientists working on this think
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.840]   hit the North American ice cap, largely.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.980]   Some of them may also have hit
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.660]   the Northern European ice cap,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.700]   resulting in that sudden, otherwise unexplained
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.620]   flood of melt water that went into the world ocean
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.620]   and caused the cooling that then took place.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.300]   But this was a disaster for life all over the planet.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.180]   And it's interesting that one of the sites
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.140]   where they find the Younger Dryas Boundary
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.500]   and where they find overwhelming evidence of an airburst
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.540]   and where they find all the shocked quartz,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.180]   the carbon microspherules, the nanodiamonds,
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.380]   the trinitite, and so on and so forth,
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.380]   all of those impact proxies are found at Apo Herrera.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.220]   That was a settlement within 150 miles of Gobekli Tepe,
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.720]   and it was hit 12,800 years ago, and it was obliterated.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.620]   Interestingly, it was re-inhabited by human beings
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.580]   within probably five years,
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:16.540]   but it was completely obliterated at that time.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.380]   And it's difficult to imagine that the people
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.820]   who lived in that area would not have been very impressed
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.660]   by what they saw happening by these massive explosions
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.860]   in the sky and the obliteration of Apo Herrera.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.900]   Now, this is a theory.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.340]   The Younger Dryas Impact, it's a hypothesis, actually.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.400]   It's not even a theory.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.260]   A theory is, I think, considered a higher level
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.620]   than a hypothesis.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.940]   That's why it's the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.980]   And of course, it has many opponents,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.060]   and there are many who disagree with it.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:51.060]   And there have been a series of peer-reviewed papers
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.060]   that have been published supposedly debunking
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.780]   the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.620]   One, I think, was in 2011.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.900]   It was called a Requiem
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.060]   for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.660]   And there's one just been published a few months ago
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.700]   or a year ago called a Complete Refutation
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.380]   of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis,
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.780]   something like that, some lengthy title.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.580]   So it's a hypothesis that has its opponents.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.220]   And even within those of us who are looking
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.020]   at the alternative side of history,
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.380]   there are different points of view.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.500]   Robert Shock from Boston University,
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.960]   the geologist who demonstrated that the erosion
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.460]   on the Sphinx may well have been caused by exposure
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.460]   to a long period of very heavy rainfall,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.260]   he doesn't go for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.740]   He fully accepts that the Younger Dryas
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.460]   was a global cataclysm and that the extinctions took place,
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.620]   but he thinks it was caused
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.340]   by some kind of massive solar outburst.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.780]   So what everybody's agreed on is the Younger Dryas was bad,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.220]   but there is dispute about what caused it.
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.740]   I personally have found the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.900]   to be the most persuasive,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.080]   which most effectively explains all the evidence.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.980]   - How important is the impact hypothesis
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.260]   to your understanding of the Ice Age advanced civilizations?
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.680]   So is it possible to have another explanation
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.560]   for environmental factors that could have erased
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.500]   most of an advanced civilization during this period?
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.280]   - In a sense, it's not the impact hypothesis
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.220]   that is central to what I'm saying.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.020]   It's the Younger Dryas that's central to what I'm saying.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.260]   And the Younger Dryas required a trigger.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.780]   Something caused it.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.860]   I think the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis,
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.480]   the notion that we're looking at a debris stream
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.580]   of a fragmenting comet, and we can still see
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.620]   that debris stream because it's still up there,
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.960]   and we still pass through it twice a year,
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.680]   is the best explanation.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.980]   But I don't mind other explanations.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.940]   It's good that there are other explanations.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.520]   The Younger Dryas is a big mystery,
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.620]   and it's not a mystery that's been solved yet.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.480]   And that word advanced civilization,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.220]   this is another word that is easily misunderstood.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.060]   And I've tried to make clear many, many times
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.500]   that when we consider the possibility
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.580]   of something like a civilization in the past,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.860]   we shouldn't imagine that it's us,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.100]   that it's something like us.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.220]   We should expect it to be completely different from us,
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.980]   but that it would have achieved certain things.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.420]   So amongst the clues that intrigue me
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.360]   are those precessional numbers
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.420]   that are found all around the world,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.180]   and are a category of ancient maps called Portolanos,
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.540]   which suddenly started to appear
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.980]   just after the crusade that entered Constantinople
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.120]   and sacked Constantinople.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.280]   The Portolanos suddenly start to appear,
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.060]   and they're extremely accurate maps.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.740]   The most of the ones that have survived
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.340]   are extremely accurate maps of the Mediterranean alone,
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.980]   but some of them show much wider areas.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.500]   For example, on these Portolanos-style maps,
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.320]   you do find a depiction of Antarctica again and again.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.420]   And another thing that these maps have in common
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.660]   is that many of the mapmakers state
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.860]   that they based their maps on multiple older source maps,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.460]   which have not survived.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.060]   These maps are intriguing
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.960]   because they have very accurate relative longitudes.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.220]   Our civilization did not crack the longitude problem
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.540]   until the mid-18th century with Harrison's chronometer,
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.040]   which was able to keep accurate time at sea.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.780]   So you could have the time in London,
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.540]   and you could have the local time at sea
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.380]   at the same time,
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.060]   and then you could work out your longitude.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.360]   There might be other ways of working out longitude as well,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.860]   but there it is.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.520]   The fact is these Portolanos
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.140]   have extremely accurate relative longitudes.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:47.340]   Secondly, some of them show the world to my eye
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.900]   as it looked during the Ice Age.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.580]   They show a much extended Indonesia
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.280]   and Malaysian Peninsula,
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.020]   and the series of islands that make up Indonesia today
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.540]   are all grouped together into one landmass.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.300]   And that was the case during the Ice Age.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.900]   That was the Sunda Shelf.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.500]   And the presence of Antarctica on some of these maps
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.100]   also puzzles and intrigues me
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.220]   and is not satisfactorily explained,
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.420]   in my view, by archeology,
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.700]   which says, oh, those mapmakers,
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.300]   they felt that the world needed
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.340]   something underneath it to balance it,
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.560]   so they put a fictional landmass there.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.080]   I don't think that makes sense.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.460]   I think somebody was mapping the world
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.500]   during the last Ice Age,
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.560]   but that doesn't mean that they had our kind of tech.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.980]   It means that they were following that exploration instinct,
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.220]   that they knew how to navigate.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.700]   They'd been watching the stars for thousands of years before.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.780]   They knew how to navigate,
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.940]   and they knew how to build seagoing ships,
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.000]   and they explored the world, and they mapped the world.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Those maps were made a very, very long time ago.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.780]   Some of them, I believe, were likely preserved
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.380]   in the Library of Alexandria.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.880]   I think even then, they were being copied and recopied.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.280]   We don't know exactly what happened
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.240]   to the Library of Alexandria, except that it was destroyed.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.600]   I suggest it's likely.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.520]   This was during the period of the Roman Empire.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.540]   I suggest it's likely that some of those maps
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.040]   were taken out of the library and taken to Constantinople,
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.640]   and that's where they were liberated during the crusade
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.240]   and entered world culture again
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   and started to be copied and recopied.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.440]   - So, from this perspective, when we talk
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.200]   about advanced Ice Age civilization,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.880]   it could have been a relatively small group of people
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.200]   with the technology of their scholars of the stars
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.600]   and their expert seafaring navigators.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.800]   - Yes, that's about as far as I would take it.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.960]   And when I say that, as I have said on a number of occasions,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.480]   that it had technology equivalent to ours
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.480]   in the 18th century, I'm referring specifically
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.640]   to the ability to calculate longitude.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.720]   I'm not saying that they were building steam engines.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.040]   I don't see any evidence for that.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.680]   - And perhaps some building tricks and skills
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.760]   of how to- - Well, definitely.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:08.240]   And this, again, is where you come to a series of mysteries
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.640]   which are perhaps best expressed on the Giza Plateau
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.340]   in Egypt with the three great pyramids
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.800]   and the extraordinary megalithic temples
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.080]   that many people don't pay much attention to.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.600]   On the Giza Plateau and the Great Sphinx itself,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.040]   this is an area of particular importance
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.280]   in understanding this issue.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.800]   - Well, can you actually describe the Sphinx
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.200]   and the Great Pyramids and what you find most mysterious
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.160]   and interesting about them?
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.340]   - Well, first of all, the astronomy.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:45.000]   And here, I must pay tribute to two individuals,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.720]   actually three individuals in particular.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.880]   One of them is John Anthony West, passed away in 2018.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.160]   He was the first person in our era to begin to wonder
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.500]   if the Sphinx was much older than it had been.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.000]   Actually, he got that idea from a philosopher
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.480]   called Schwaller de Lubix,
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.160]   who'd noticed what he thought was water erosion
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.640]   on the body of the Sphinx.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.920]   John West picked that up,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.800]   and he was a great amateur Egyptologist himself.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.320]   He spent most of his life in Egypt,
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.640]   and he was hugely versed in ancient Egypt.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.880]   And when he looked at the Sphinx
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.080]   and at the strange scalloped erosion patterns
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.000]   and the vertical fissures,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.960]   particularly in the trench around the Sphinx,
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.840]   he began to think maybe Schwaller was right.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.280]   Maybe there was some sort of flooding here,
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.200]   and that's when he brought Robert Shock,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.720]   second person I'd like to recognize,
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.560]   geologist at Boston University.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.240]   He brought Shock to Giza,
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.700]   and Shock was the first geologist to stick his neck out,
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:43.840]   risk the ire of Egyptologists,
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.040]   and say, "Well, it looks to me like the Sphinx
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.320]   "was exposed to at least 1,000 years of heavy rainfall."
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.600]   And as Shock's calculations have continued,
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.760]   as he's continued to be immersed in this mystery,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.640]   he's continuously pushed that back.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.800]   And he's now, again, looking at the date
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.480]   of around 12,000, 12 1/2 thousand years ago
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.320]   during the Younger Dryas
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.480]   for the creation of the Great Sphinx.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.120]   And then, of course, this is the period
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.600]   of the wet Sahara, the humid Sahara.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.560]   The Sahara was a completely different place
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.400]   during the Ice Age.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.240]   There were rivers in it.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.160]   There were lakes in it.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.380]   It was fertile.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.560]   It was possibly densely populated.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.280]   And there was a lot of rain.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.480]   There's not no rain in Giza today,
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.160]   but there's relatively little rain.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.680]   The next person, not enough rain
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.800]   to cause that erosion damage on the Sphinx.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.000]   The next person who needs to be mentioned
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.680]   in this context is Robert Boval.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:40.040]   Robert and I have co-authored a number of books together.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.120]   Unfortunately, Robert has been very ill
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.680]   for the last seven years.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:48.780]   He's got a very bad chest infection.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:52.260]   And I think also that Robert became very demoralized
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.260]   by the attacks of Egyptologists on his work.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.300]   But Robert is the genius,
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.820]   and it does take a genius sometime
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.960]   to make these connections,
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.060]   'cause nobody'd noticed it before,
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.940]   that the three pyramids of Giza
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.260]   are laid out on the ground
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:09.620]   in the pattern of the three stars of Orion's Belt.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.900]   And skeptics will say, "Well, you can find any buildings
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.460]   "and line them up with any stars you want."
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:17.460]   But Orion actually isn't any old constellation.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.820]   Orion was the god Osiris in the sky.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.580]   He was, the ancient Egyptians
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.060]   called the Orion constellation Sahu,
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.100]   and they recognized it as the celestial image
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.080]   of the god Osiris.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.360]   So what's being copied on the ground
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.400]   is the belt of a deity, of a celestial deity.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.560]   It's not just a random constellation.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.280]   And then when we take precession into account,
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.720]   you find something else very intriguing happening.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.920]   First of all, you find that the exact orientation
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.840]   of the pyramids as it is today,
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.840]   and pretty much as it was when they're supposed
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.560]   to have been built 4,500 years ago,
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.840]   it's not precisely related
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.640]   to how Orion's Belt looked at that time.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.080]   There's a bit of a twist.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.560]   They're not quite right.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.120]   But as you precess the stars backwards,
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.600]   as you go back, and back, and back,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.040]   and you come to around 10,500 BC,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.820]   12,500 years ago in the Younger Dryas,
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.100]   you find that suddenly they lock perfectly.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.840]   They match perfectly with the three pyramids on the ground.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.020]   And that's the same moment that the Great Sphinx,
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.960]   an equinoctial monument aligned perfectly
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.720]   to the rising sun on the spring equinox.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.200]   Anybody can test this for themselves.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.960]   Just go to Giza on the 21st of March,
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.440]   be there before dawn, stand behind the Sphinx,
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.760]   and you will see the sun rising directly in line
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.640]   with the gaze of the Sphinx.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.920]   But the question is,
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.040]   what constellation was behind the Sphinx?
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.880]   And 12,500 years ago, it was the constellation of Leo.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.480]   And actually, the constellation of Leo
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.920]   has a very Sphinx-like look.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:55.360]   And I and my colleagues are pretty sure
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.720]   that the Sphinx was originally a lion entirely,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.760]   and that it, over the thousands of years,
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.800]   it became damaged, it became eroded,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.940]   particularly the part of it that sticks out the head.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.480]   There were periods when the Sphinx
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.960]   was completely covered in sand,
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.560]   but still the head stuck out.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.600]   By the time you come to the fourth dynasty,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.160]   when the Great Pyramids are supposedly built,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.200]   by the time you come to the fourth dynasty,
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.400]   the head of the lion, original lion head,
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.320]   would have been a complete mess.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.720]   And we suggest that it was then recarved
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.840]   into a pharaonic head.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.160]   Egyptologists think it was the pharaoh Khafre,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.680]   but there's no real strong resemblance.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.960]   But it's definitely wearing the nemesis headdress
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.760]   of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.440]   And we think that that's the result of a recarving
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.040]   of what was originally not only a lion-bodied,
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.440]   but also a lion-headed monument.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.880]   It wouldn't make sense
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.160]   if you create an equinoctial marker
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.960]   in the time of Khafre, 4,500 years ago,
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.120]   and the Sphinx is an equinoctial marker.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.440]   I mean, it's 270 feet long and 70 feet high,
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.160]   and it's looking directly at the rising sun on the equinox.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.960]   If you create it then, you would be better,
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.960]   you'd be more likely to create it in the shape of a bull,
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.440]   because that was the age of Taurus
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.840]   when the constellation of Taurus housed the sun
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.200]   on the spring equinox.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.360]   So why is it a lion?
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.240]   And again, we think that's because
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   of that observation of the skies,
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.000]   and putting on the ground, as above, so below,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.360]   putting on the ground an image of the sky
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   at a particular time.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.040]   Now, the fact that the Giza Plateau,
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.880]   it's a fact, of course,
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.240]   that Egyptologists completely dispute,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.160]   but the fact that the principal monuments
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.320]   of the Giza Plateau, the Three Great Pyramids,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.360]   and the Great Sphinx all lock astronomically
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.920]   on the date of around 10,500 BC,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.320]   to me is most unlikely to be an accident.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.240]   And actually, if you look at computer software
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.200]   at the sky at that time,
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.120]   you'll see that the Milky Way is very prominent,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.480]   and seems to be mirrored on the ground by the River Nile.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.040]   I suggest that may be one of the reasons amongst many
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.240]   why Giza was chosen as the site for this
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.760]   very special place.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.960]   So the point I want to make is that
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.520]   an astronomical design on the ground,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.640]   which memorializes a very ancient date,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.920]   does not have to have been done 12,500 years ago.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.360]   If from the ancient Egyptian point of view,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.120]   you're there 4,500 years ago,
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.600]   and there's a time 8,000 years before that,
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.240]   which is very, very, very important to you,
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.920]   you could use astronomical language
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.600]   and megalithic architecture to memorialize that date
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.000]   on the Giza Plateau,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.200]   which is what we think we're looking at,
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.440]   except for one thing,
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.080]   and that's the erosion patterns on the Sphinx.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.880]   And we're pretty sure that the Sphinx, at least,
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.560]   does date back to 12,500 years ago.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.200]   And with it, the megalithic temples,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.280]   the so-called Vali Temple,
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.440]   which stands just to the east
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.960]   and just to the south of the Sphinx,
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.920]   and the Sphinx Temple,
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.840]   which stands directly in front of the Sphinx.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.120]   The Sphinx Temple has largely been destroyed,
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.080]   but the Vali Temple, attributed to Khafre,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.120]   on no good grounds whatsoever,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.920]   is a huge megalithic construction
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.400]   with blocks of limestone that weigh up to 100 tons each.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.400]   And yet, it has been remodeled, refaced with granite.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.120]   There are granite blocks that are placed
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.400]   on top of the core limestone blocks.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.520]   And those core limestone blocks were already eroded
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.280]   when the granite blocks were put there.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.120]   Why?
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.360]   Because the granite blocks have actually been purposefully
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.000]   and deliberately cut to fit into the erosion marks
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.720]   on the, we believe, much older megalithic blocks there.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.360]   So I think Giza is a very complicated site.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.800]   I would never seek to divorce
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.520]   the dynastic ancient Egyptians from the Great Pyramids.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.480]   They were closely involved in the construction
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.640]   of the Great Pyramids as we see them today.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.120]   But what I do suggest is that there were very low platforms
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.720]   on the Giza Plateau that are much older.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.320]   And that when we look at the three Great Pyramids,
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.080]   we're looking at a renovation and a restoration
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.040]   and a enhancement of much older structures
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.520]   that had existed on the Giza Plateau
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.280]   for a much longer period before that.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.600]   Actually, the Great Pyramid is built around a natural hill.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.320]   And that natural hill might have been seen
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   as the original primeval mound to the ancient Egyptians.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.520]   - So the idea is that the Sphinx was there
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.600]   long before the pyramids.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.120]   And the pyramids were built by the Egyptian
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.040]   to celebrate further an already holy place.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.560]   - Yeah, and there were platforms in place
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.540]   where the pyramids stand.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.200]   Not the pyramids as we see them today,
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.760]   but the base of those pyramids
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.480]   was already in place at that time.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.520]   - So what's the case, what's the evidence
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.680]   that the Egyptologists used to make the attributions
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.200]   that they do for the dating of the pyramids and the Sphinx?
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.800]   - Well, the three Great Pyramids of Giza
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.680]   are different from later pyramids.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.820]   This is another problem that I have with the whole thing,
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.200]   is the story of pyramid building.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.960]   When did it really begin?
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.080]   And the timeline that we get from Egyptology
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   is the first pyramid, is the pyramid of the pharaoh Djoser,
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.600]   the step pyramid at Saqqara.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.280]   About a hundred years or so
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.520]   before the Giza pyramids are built.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.460]   And then we have this explosion in the fourth dynasty
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.080]   of true pyramids.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   We have three of them attributed to a single pharaoh,
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.760]   Sneferu, who built supposedly the pyramid at Maidum
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.280]   and the two pyramids at Dahshur,
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.520]   the Bent and the Red Pyramid.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.360]   And then within that same hundred year span,
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.760]   we have the Giza pyramids being built.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.800]   This is according to the orthodox chronology.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.080]   And then suddenly, once the Giza project is finished,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.760]   pyramid building goes into a massive slump in ancient Egypt.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.540]   And the pyramids of the fifth dynasty
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.020]   are frankly speaking a mess outside.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.800]   They're very inferior constructions.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.200]   You can hardly recognize them as pyramids at all.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.660]   But what happens when you go inside them
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:39.540]   is you find that they're extensively covered in hieroglyphs
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.460]   and imagery repeating the name of the king
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.540]   who was supposedly buried in that place.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.980]   Whereas the Giza pyramids
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.340]   have no internal inscriptions whatsoever.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.980]   What we do have is one piece of graffiti
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.380]   about which there is some controversy.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.080]   Basic statistics, it's a 6 million ton structure.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.900]   Each side is about 750 feet long.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.100]   It's aligned almost perfectly
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.720]   to true North, South, East, and West
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.300]   within 3/60 of a single degree.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.180]   It's a 60th because degrees are divided into 60s.
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:21.060]   And it's the precision of the orientation
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.120]   and the absolute massive size of the thing.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.940]   Plus it's very complicated internal passageways
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.980]   that are involved in it.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.580]   You know, in the ninth century,
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.220]   the Great Pyramid still had its facing stones in place.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.220]   But there was an Arab caliph, Caliph al-Mamun,
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.260]   who had already realized that other pyramids
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.060]   did have their entrances in the North face.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.620]   Nobody knew where the entrance to the Great Pyramid was.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.540]   But he figured if there's an entrance to this thing,
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.560]   it's gonna be in the North face somewhere.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.460]   So he put together a team of workers
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.860]   and they went in with sledgehammers
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.980]   and they started smashing
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.260]   where he thought would be the entrance.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.580]   And they cut their way into the Great Pyramid
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.700]   for a distance of maybe a hundred feet.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.500]   And then the hammering that they did dislodged something.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.420]   They heard a little bit further away, something big falling.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.580]   And they realized there was a cavity there.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.300]   And they started heading in that direction.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.900]   And then they joined the internal passageway
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.780]   of the Great Pyramid,
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.140]   the descending and the ascending corridors that go up.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.820]   When you go up the ascending corridor,
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.780]   every one of the internal passageways
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.380]   in the Great Pyramid that people can walk in,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.500]   slopes at an angle of 26 degrees.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.780]   That's interesting because the angle of slope
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.740]   of the exterior of the Great Pyramid is 52 degrees.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.620]   So we know mathematicians were at work
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.200]   as well as geometers in the creation of the Great Pyramid.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.940]   If you go up the Grand Gallery,
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.420]   which is at the end of the so-called ascending corridor,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.220]   and it's above the so-called Queen's Chamber,
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.620]   you go up the Grand Gallery,
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.860]   you're eventually going to come
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.580]   to what is known as the King's Chamber,
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.620]   in which there is a sarcophagus.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.300]   And that sarcophagus is a little bit too big
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.620]   to have been got in through the narrow entrance passageway.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.740]   It's almost as though the so-called King's Chamber
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:16.440]   was built around the sarcophagus already in place.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.660]   Above the King's Chamber are five other chamberss.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.020]   These are known as relieving chambers.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.660]   The theory was that they were built
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.140]   to relieve the pressure on the King's Chamber
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.980]   of the weight of the monument.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.460]   But I think what makes that theory dubious
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.420]   is the fact that even lower down,
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.980]   where more weight was involved,
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.020]   you have the Queen's Chamber,
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.500]   and there are no such relieving chambers above that.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.140]   In the top of these five chambers,
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.260]   a British adventurer and vandal called Howard Vise,
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.700]   who dynamited his way into those chambers
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.700]   in the first place, allegedly found,
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.940]   well, he claims he found the graffiti,
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.460]   a piece of graffiti left by a work gang
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.940]   naming the pharaoh Khufu.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.400]   And it's true, I've been in that chamber,
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.900]   and there is the cartouche of Khufu there,
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.220]   quite recognizable.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.820]   But the dispute around it is whether
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.540]   that is a genuine piece of graffiti
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.540]   dating from the old kingdom,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.920]   or whether Howard Vise actually put it there himself,
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.620]   because he was in desperate need of money at the time.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.420]   I'm not sure what the answer to that question is.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   Another reason why, but it's one of the reasons
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.500]   that Egyptologists feel confident in saying
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.180]   that the pyramid is the work of Khufu.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.620]   Another is what is called the Wadi al-Jarf papyri,
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:37.280]   where on the Red Sea, a diary,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.620]   the diary of an individual called Merer was found,
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.940]   and he talks about bringing highly polished limestone
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.340]   to the Great Pyramid.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.260]   And it's clear that what he's talking about
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.280]   is the facing stones of the Great Pyramid.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.420]   He's not talking about the body of the Great Pyramid.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.060]   He's talking about the facing stones of the Great Pyramid
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.320]   during the reign of Khufu.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.100]   So that's another reason why the Great Pyramid
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.140]   is attributed to Khufu.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.100]   But I think that Khufu was undoubtedly involved
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.880]   in the Great Pyramid and in a big way,
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.020]   but I think he was building upon and elaborating
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   a much older structure.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.180]   And I think the heart of that structure
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.320]   is the subterranean chamber,
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.220]   which is 100 feet vertically beneath the base
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.980]   of the Great Pyramid.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.040]   Anybody who suffers from claustrophobia
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.280]   will not enjoy being down there.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.720]   You got to go down a 26 degree sloping corridor
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.920]   until a distance of about 300 feet.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.080]   It's 100 feet vertically,
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.660]   but the slope means you're gonna walk a distance of,
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.300]   not walk, you're gonna ape walk.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.320]   You're almost gonna have to crawl.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.680]   I've learned from long experience that the best way
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.980]   to go down these corridors is actually backwards.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.840]   If you go forward, you keep bumping your head on them
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.360]   'cause they're only three feet, five inches high.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.540]   You get down to the bottom,
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.660]   you have a short horizontal passage,
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.400]   and then you get into the subterranean chamber.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.100]   The theory of Egyptology is that this was supposed
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.260]   to be the burial place of Khufu.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:03.100]   But after cutting out that 300 foot long,
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.980]   26 degree sloping passage,
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.060]   a lot of which passes through bedrock
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.020]   and having cut the subterranean chamber out of bedrock,
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.380]   gone to all that trouble,
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.540]   they decided they wouldn't bury him there.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.080]   And they built what's now known as the queen's chamber
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   as his burial chamber.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.120]   But then they decided that wouldn't do either,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.000]   so they then built the king's chamber.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.280]   And that's where the pharaoh
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.400]   is supposed to have been buried.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.680]   Those Arab raiders under Caliph Mamun
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.720]   didn't find anything in the Great Pyramid at all.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.640]   - So your idea is that the Sphinx
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.080]   and maybe some aspects of the pyramid were much earlier.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.360]   And why that's important is in that case,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.740]   it would be evidence of some transfer of technology
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:50.380]   from a much older civilization.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:54.280]   The idea is that during the Younger Dryas,
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.260]   most of that civilization was either destroyed or damaged
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.020]   and they desperately scattered across the globe.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.940]   - Seeking refuge.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.940]   - Seeking refuge and telling stories of maybe one,
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.520]   the importance of the stars,
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.860]   their knowledge about the stars,
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.500]   and their knowledge about building
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.220]   and knowledge about navigation.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:18.940]   - That's roughly the idea.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:22.300]   So it's interesting that the ancient Egyptians
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:27.300]   have a notion of an epoch that they call Zep Tepi,
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.220]   which is the first time, it means the first time.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.560]   This is when the gods walked the earth.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.560]   This is when seven sages brought wisdom to ancient Egypt.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.020]   And that is seen as the origin
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.520]   of ancient Egyptian civilization.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.820]   There are king lists, by the ancient Egyptians themselves,
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.900]   there are king lists that go back
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.540]   way beyond the first dynasty,
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.040]   go back 30,000 years into the past in ancient Egypt,
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.740]   considered to be entirely mythical by Egyptologists.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.060]   But nevertheless, it's interesting
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.580]   that there's that reference to remote time.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.620]   Now, what you also have in Egypt
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.860]   are what might almost be described as secret societies.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.020]   The followers of Horus are one of those,
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.140]   specifically tasked with bringing forward
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.900]   the knowledge from the first time into later periods.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.460]   The souls of Pea and Neken are another one
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.340]   of these mysterious secret society groups
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.920]   who are possessors of knowledge
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.380]   that they transmit to the future.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.940]   And what I'm broadly suggesting is that those survivors
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.180]   of the Angadrias Cataclysm who settled in Giza
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.140]   may have been relatively small in number.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.380]   It's interesting that they are referred to
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.740]   in the Edfu building text as seven sages,
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.700]   because that repeats again and again.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:52.220]   It's also in Mesopotamia, it's seven sages,
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.740]   seven Apkallu, who come out of the waters
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.500]   of the Persian Gulf and teach people
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:01.540]   all the skills of agriculture and of architecture
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.780]   and of astronomy.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.580]   It's found all around the world
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.820]   that there was a relatively small number of people
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.500]   who took refuge in Giza,
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   who benefited from the survival skills
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.940]   of the hunter-foragers who lived at Giza at that time
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.980]   and who also passed on their knowledge
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.580]   to those hunter-foragers.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.060]   But it was not knowledge that was ready
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.420]   to be put into shape at that time.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.340]   And that knowledge was then preserved
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:29.100]   and kept and handled within very secretive groups
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.980]   that passed it down over thousands of years.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.140]   And finally, it bursts into full form
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.020]   in the fourth dynasty in ancient Egypt.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.500]   And you know, the notion that knowledge
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.580]   might be transferred over thousands of years
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.620]   shouldn't be absurd.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.580]   We know, for example, in the case of ancient Israel,
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.380]   it goes back to the time of Abraham,
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.500]   which is pretty much, I think, around 2000 BC.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.740]   And knowledge has been preserved from that time
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.980]   right up to the present day.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.020]   So if you can preserve knowledge for 4,000 years,
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.420]   you can probably preserve it for eight.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.780]   - Now, of course, the error bars on this are quite large,
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.140]   but if an advanced Ice Age civilization existed,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.140]   where do you think it was?
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:16.460]   Where do you think we might find it one day if it existed?
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.780]   And how big do you think it might have been?
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.660]   - Well, this is where I'm often accused
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.580]   of presenting a God of the Gaps argument,
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.140]   that I think there was a lost civilization
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.420]   because there's lots of the Earth
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.580]   that archaeologists have never looked at.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.820]   Of course, I'm not thinking that.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.580]   These are very special gaps that I'm interested in.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.340]   And I'm interested in them because of all the curiosities
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.380]   and the puzzlement that I've expressed to you before.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.100]   It's not just because there are gaps
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.340]   in the archaeological record.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.780]   It's because those gaps involve places
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.540]   that were very interesting places to live
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.980]   during the Ice Age.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:52.540]   And they specifically include the Sahara Desert,
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:55.220]   which was not a desert during the Ice Age
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.100]   and went through this warm, wet period
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.940]   when it was very, very fertile.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.780]   Certainly, some archaeology has been done in the Sahara,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.340]   but it's fractional, it's tiny.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.420]   And I think if we want to get into the origins,
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.700]   true origins of ancient Egyptian civilization,
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.060]   of the peoples of ancient Egypt,
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.700]   we need to be looking in the Sahara for that.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:20.700]   And the Amazon rainforest is another example of this.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:25.580]   I think the Sahara is about 9 million square kilometers.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.220]   The Amazon that's left under dense canopy rainforest
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:33.900]   is about 5 million square kilometers, maybe closer to six.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:38.020]   And then you have the continental shelves
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.900]   that were submerged by sea level rise
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:40.820]   at the end of the Ice Age.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:44.780]   Now, it's well established that sea level rose by 400 feet,
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.380]   but it didn't rise by 400 feet overnight.
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:50.020]   It came in dribs and drabs.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.460]   There were periods of very rapid,
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.660]   quite significant sea level rise.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.380]   And there were periods when the sea level
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.660]   was rising much more slowly.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.660]   So that 400 foot sea level rise is spread out
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.500]   over a period of about 10,000 years.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.940]   But there are episodes within it,
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.700]   like Meltwater Pulse 1B, like Meltwater Pulse 1A,
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.900]   when the flooding was really immense.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.780]   - How big do you think it might've been?
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:18.300]   And do you think it was spread across the globe?
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.620]   So if there were expert navigators,
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.220]   do you think they spread across the globe?
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.620]   - Well, the reason that I'm talking about the gaps is
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.540]   I don't know where this civilization started
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.580]   or where it was based.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:33.940]   All I'm seeing are clues and mysteries and puzzles
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.700]   that intrigue me and which suggest to me
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.340]   that something is missing from our past.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.500]   And I'm not inclined to look for that missing something
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.100]   in, for example, Northern Europe,
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.900]   because Northern Europe was not a very nice place to live
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.820]   during the Ice Age.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.580]   I mean, nobody smart would build a civilization
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.900]   in Northern Europe 12,000 years ago.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.100]   It was a hideous, frozen wasteland.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.620]   The places to look are places that were hospitable
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.100]   and welcoming to human beings during the Ice Age.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.140]   And that, of course, includes the coastlines
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.860]   that are now underwater.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.940]   Of course, it includes the Sahara Desert.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.580]   And of course, it includes the Amazon rainforest as well.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.460]   All of these places, I think, are candidates
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.580]   for, quote, unquote, my lost civilization.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:22.460]   And because I think, largely from those ancient maps,
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.820]   that it was a navigating, seafaring civilization,
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.860]   I suspect that it wasn't only in one place.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.060]   It was probably in a number of places.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.420]   And then I can only speculate.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:38.220]   Maybe there was a cultural value
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.940]   where it was felt that it was not appropriate
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.940]   to interfere with the lives of hunter-foragers at that time.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.660]   Maybe it was felt that they should keep
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.100]   their distance from them.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.700]   Just as even today, there is a feeling
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.820]   that we shouldn't be interfering too much
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.460]   with the uncontacted tribes in the Amazon rainforest.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.420]   Although, interestingly, some of those tribes
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.140]   are now using cell phones.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.620]   That possibility may have been there in the past.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.820]   And only when we come to a global cataclysm
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.900]   does it become essential to have outreach
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.660]   and actually to take refuge
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.580]   amongst those hunter-forager populations.
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.020]   That is the hypothesis that I'm putting forward.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.820]   I'm not claiming that it's a fact.
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.420]   But for me, it helps to explain the evidence.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.260]   - So that speaks to one of the challenges
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.220]   that archeologists provide to this idea,
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:32.940]   is that there is a lot of evidence of humans in the Ice Age,
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.380]   and they appear to be all hunter-gatherers.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:40.820]   But like you said, only a small percent
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.300]   of areas where humans have lived
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.340]   have been studied by archeologists.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.180]   - That's right.
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.020]   Very tiny percent.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.660]   Even a tiny percent of every archeological site
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.060]   has been studied by archeologists, too.
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.940]   Typically, one to five percent
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   of any archeological site is excavated.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.260]   - I mean, that's why, go back a tip,
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.540]   it fills my mind with imagination,
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.500]   especially seeing it as a time capsule.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:07.420]   It's almost certain that there's places on Earth
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:10.820]   we haven't discovered, that once we do,
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.340]   even if it's after the Ice Age,
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.540]   will change our view of human history.
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.220]   Do you think there's going to be a place,
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.740]   like, what will be your dream thing to discover,
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:25.620]   like Gobekli Tepe, that says a definitive, like,
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.060]   perturbation to our understanding of Ice Age history?
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.420]   - Some kind of archive.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.460]   Some kind of Hall of Records.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:35.500]   There's both mystical associations
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.100]   with the Hall of Records at Giza,
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.780]   from people like the Edgar Cayce Organization.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.140]   There's also ancient Egyptian traditions,
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.260]   which suggest that something was concealed
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.340]   beneath the Sphinx.
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.980]   This is not an idea that is alien to ancient Egypt,
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:54.740]   it's quite present in ancient Egypt.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.140]   So far, as far as I know,
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.260]   nobody has dug down beneath the Sphinx.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.820]   And of course, there's very good reasons for that.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.740]   You don't want to damage the place too much,
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.660]   but let's call it the Hall of Records.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.060]   I'd love to find that.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:13.220]   But I think in a way, that's what Gobekli Tepe is.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:15.180]   Gobekli Tepe is a Hall of Records.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.980]   You know, it's interesting that just as I've tried
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:21.060]   to outline, I hope reasonably clearly,
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.980]   that the three great pyramids of Giza
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.460]   match Orion's belt in 10,500 BC,
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:28.780]   just as the Sphinx matches Leo in 10,500 BC,
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.620]   12,500 years ago or so.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.300]   Pillar 43 in enclosure D at Gobekli Tepe
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.460]   contains what a number of researchers,
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.420]   myself included, regard as an astronomical diagram.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.380]   Martin Swetman of Edinburgh University
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.180]   has brought forward the best work in this field,
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.260]   but it was initially started
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.700]   by a gentleman called Paul Burley,
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.940]   who noticed that one of the figures on Pillar 43
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:57.300]   is a scorpion, very much like we represent
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.660]   the constellation of Scorpio today,
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.780]   and that above it is a vulture with outstretched wings,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.220]   which is in a posture very similar to the constellation
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.580]   that we call Sagittarius,
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.540]   and on that outstretched wing is a circular object.
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.940]   And the suggestion is that it's marking the time
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.100]   when the sun was at the center of the Dark Rift
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:22.460]   in the Milky Way at the summer solstice
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.980]   12,500 years ago.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.420]   That's what it's marking.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.380]   And it's interesting that the same date
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.860]   can be deduced from Pillar 43.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.900]   Of course, it's controversial.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.740]   Martin Swetman's ideas are by no means accepted
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.260]   by archeology,
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.900]   but he's done very, very thorough,
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.540]   detailed statistical work on this,
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.140]   and I'm personally convinced.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:45.660]   So we have a time capsule at Gobekli Tepe,
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.700]   which is memorializing a date
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:52.180]   that is at least 1,200 years before Gobekli Tepe was built,
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.260]   if that dating of 11,600 years ago
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.620]   proves to be absolutely the oldest date,
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.540]   as it is at present.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:04.020]   The date memorialized on Pillar 43 is 12,800 years ago,
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.500]   the beginning of the Younger Dryness,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.580]   the beginning of the impact event.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.260]   And then Giza does the same thing,
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.980]   but in much larger scale.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:17.820]   It uses massive megalithic architecture,
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.780]   which is very difficult to destroy,
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   and a profound knowledge of astronomy
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:26.100]   to encode a date in a language that any culture,
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.220]   which is sufficiently literate in astronomy,
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.660]   will be able to decode.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.460]   We don't have to have a script that we can't read,
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.700]   like we do with the Indus Valley civilization
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.180]   or with the Easter Island script.
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.180]   We don't have to have a script that can't be interpreted.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.020]   If you use astronomical language,
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:45.660]   then any astronomical literate civilization
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.300]   will be able to give you a date.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.020]   The Hoover Dam has a star map built into it,
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.140]   and that star map is part of an exhibition
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.180]   that was put there at the founding of the Hoover Dam.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.180]   And what it does is it freezes the sky above the Hoover Dam
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.100]   at the moment of its completion.
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.100]   And Oscar Hansen, the artist who created that piece,
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.220]   said so specifically that this would be so
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.140]   that any future culture would be able to know
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.140]   the time of the dam's construction.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.380]   So you can use astronomy and architecture
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:22.660]   to memorialize a particular date.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.980]   - Quick pause, bathroom break?
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.580]   - Sounds good.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:29.500]   - So to me, the story that we've been talking about,
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.940]   it is both exciting
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:36.860]   if the mainstream archeology narrative is correct
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.140]   and the one you're constructing is correct.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.260]   Both are super interesting
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.340]   because the mainstream archeology perspective
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:46.540]   means that there is something about the human mind
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:51.420]   from which the pyramids, these ideas spring naturally.
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.980]   You place humans anywhere, you place them on Mars,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.820]   it's gonna come out that way.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.180]   So that's an interesting story of human psychology
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.740]   that then becomes even more interesting
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:04.860]   when you evolve out of Africa with Homo sapiens,
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.900]   how they think about the world.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.340]   That's super interesting.
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.940]   And then if there's an ancient civilization,
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.180]   advanced civilization that explains
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.860]   why there's so many similar types of ideas that spread,
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:20.700]   that means that there's so much undiscovered still
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.700]   about the sort of the spring
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.700]   of these ideas of civilization that come.
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.260]   So to me, they're both fascinating.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.340]   So I don't know why there's so much sort of infighting,
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.580]   but I think it's partly territorial.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:36.580]   I think that, I don't, I can't speak of all archeologists,
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:41.060]   but some archeologists feel very territorial
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.740]   about their profession and they do not feel happy
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:49.740]   about outsiders entering their realm,
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:53.380]   especially if those outsiders have a large platform.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:58.300]   And that's, I've found that the attacks on me
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.460]   by archeologists have increased step-by-step
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.380]   with the increase of my exposure.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:07.020]   I wasn't very interesting to them
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:10.660]   when I just had one minor bestseller in 1992
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.180]   with a book called "The Sign and the Seal."
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:17.060]   But when "Fingerprints of the Gods" was published in 1995
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.580]   and became a global bestseller,
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.060]   then I started to attract their attention
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:26.700]   and appear to have been regarded as a threat to them.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.580]   And that is the case today.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.140]   That is why "Ancient Apocalypse" season one
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.780]   was defined as the most dangerous show on Netflix.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.340]   It's why the Society for American Archeology
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.900]   wrote an open letter to Netflix,
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.340]   asking Netflix to reclassify the series as science fiction.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.380]   It's why they accused the series
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:52.380]   of anti-Semitism, misogyny, white supremacism,
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:55.980]   and a whole, I don't know, a whole bunch of other things
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.860]   that have nothing to do with anything
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.780]   that's in the series.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.780]   It was like, we must shut this down.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.500]   This is so dangerous to us.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:06.540]   Certainly not a danger,
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.060]   there are many more dangerous things in the world
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:13.300]   than a television series going on right now.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.660]   But maybe it was seen as a danger to archeology,
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.420]   that this non-archeologist was in archeological terrain
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:23.780]   and being viewed and seen by large,
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.860]   and read by large numbers of people.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.740]   Maybe that was part of the problem.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.660]   And human nature being what it is,
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.340]   I noticed that two of my principal critics,
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:37.100]   John Hoopes from the University of Kansas
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.620]   and Flint Dibble, who's now teaching
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.660]   at the University of Cardiff in Wales in the UK,
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:46.220]   are both people who like to have media exposure.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.060]   And John Hoopes had just recently started
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:50.100]   his YouTube channel.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.780]   Flint Dibble has had one for quite a while.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:55.540]   Pretty small number of followers.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.100]   I think that they feel that they should be the ones
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.740]   who are getting the global attention,
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.220]   and that it's not right that I am.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:08.060]   And that the best way to stop that is to stop me,
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:10.740]   to shut me down, to get me canceled.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:15.660]   And basically requiring Netflix to relabel my series
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.940]   from a documentary to a science fiction,
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.420]   which is what they actually had the temerity
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.900]   to suggest to Netflix.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:26.940]   If that had gone through, if Netflix had listened to them,
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.140]   that would have effectively been the cancellation
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.340]   of my documentary series.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:32.940]   It would no longer have been ranked under documentary.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.140]   So it was a deliberate attempt to shut me down.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.740]   And I see that going on again and again,
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.220]   and it's so unfortunate and so unnecessary.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.660]   I've become very defensive towards archeology.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:48.660]   I hit back after 30 years of these attacks on my work.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:51.100]   I'm tired of it.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.860]   And I do defend myself.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.340]   And sometimes I'm perhaps over vigorous in that defense.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.300]   Maybe I was a little bit too strong
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.180]   in my critique of archeology in the first season
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.180]   of "Ancient Apocalypse."
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.460]   Maybe I should have been a bit gentler and a bit kinder.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:07.460]   And I've tried to reflect that in the second season,
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.540]   and to bring also many more indigenous voices
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.580]   into the second season,
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.900]   as well as the voices of many more archeologists.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.740]   - Yeah, in general,
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:21.500]   I got a chance to get a glimpse of the archeology community.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:26.500]   And in archeology, in science in general,
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:30.940]   I don't have much patience for this kind of arrogance
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:35.940]   or snark or dismissal of general human curiosity
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:39.300]   that I think your work inspires in people.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.380]   So that's why people like Ed Barnhart,
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:44.340]   who I recently had a conversation with,
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.620]   he radiates sort of kindness and curiosity as well.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.500]   And it's like that kind of approach to ideas,
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:55.100]   especially about human history, it inspires people,
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.700]   inspires millions of people to ask questions.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.540]   I mean, that's why you had Keanu Reeves on the new season.
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.100]   He's basically coming to the show
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.180]   from that same perspective of curiosity.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.020]   - Keanu is genuinely curious about the past
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.140]   and very, very interested in it.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:12.100]   And he's bringing to it questions
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:13.500]   that everybody brings to the past.
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.380]   He's speaking for every man in the series.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:21.660]   - So given that, can you maybe steel man the case
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:26.160]   that archeologists make about this period
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.660]   that we've been talking about?
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:32.100]   Can you make the case that that is indeed what happened,
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.740]   is it was hunter-gatherers for a long time,
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.260]   and then there was a cataclysm,
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.140]   a very difficult period in human history
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.460]   with the Younger Dryas,
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.820]   and that changed the environment
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.180]   and then led to the springing up of civilizations
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.880]   at different places on Earth.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.700]   Can you sort of make the case for that?
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.940]   - Oh, no, I completely understand
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:54.380]   why that is the position of archeology,
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.220]   because that's what they've found.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.340]   Archeology is very much wishing to define itself
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:03.780]   as a science, and it uses the techniques
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.360]   of weighing and measuring and counting
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.020]   are very key to what archeology does.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.900]   And in what they've found
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.260]   and what they've studied around the world,
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.460]   they don't see any traces of a lost civilization.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.220]   And the idea that,
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:24.940]   besides, we live in a very politically correct world today,
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:29.940]   and the idea that some kind of lost civilization
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.340]   brought knowledge to other cultures around the world
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:36.100]   is seen as almost racist or colonialist in some way.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.100]   It triggers that aspect as well.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.260]   But basically, I think majority of archeologists
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.860]   are in complete good faith on this.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:47.940]   I don't think that anybody's really seeking to frame me.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:52.140]   I think that what we're hearing from most archeologists,
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.080]   some much more vicious than others,
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.480]   but what we're hearing from most archeologists
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.020]   is this is what we found,
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:01.860]   and we don't see evidence for a lost civilization in it.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:06.860]   And to that, I must reply, please look at the myths.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.060]   Please consider the implications of the Younger Dryas.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:12.820]   Please look at the ancient astronomy.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.280]   Please look at those ancient maps
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.980]   and don't just dismiss them and sneer at them.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.020]   And for God's sake, please look more deeply
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.140]   at the parts of the world that were immensely habitable
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.140]   and attractive during the Ice Age,
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.460]   and that have hardly been studied by archeology at all,
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:31.460]   before you tell us that your theory is the only one
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.700]   that can possibly be correct.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.380]   In fact, it's a very arrogant and silly position
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.860]   of archeology, because archeological theories
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:40.540]   are always being overthrown.
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.520]   It can take years, it can take decades.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.300]   It took decades in the case of the Clovis First hypothesis
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.540]   for the settlement of the Americas.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:53.060]   But sooner or later, a bad idea will be kicked out
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.660]   by a preponderance of evidence
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:57.500]   that that idea does not explain.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.900]   - If we can just look back at your debate
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:03.860]   with Flint Dibble on Joe Rogan experience,
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.860]   what are some takeaways from that?
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.500]   What have you learned?
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.980]   Maybe what are some things you like about Flint?
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.420]   You said that he's one of your big critics,
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.980]   but what do you like about his ideas
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.820]   and what were you maybe bothered by?
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.500]   - First of all, just very recently,
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.580]   and it can be found on my YouTube channel
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.540]   and it's signaled on my website,
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:27.300]   I have made a video, runs about an hour,
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.380]   which looks at a series of statements
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.460]   that Flint made during the debate,
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.360]   which I was not prepared to answer.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.460]   And it turns out that some of those statements
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.740]   are not correct.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:43.620]   The notion, for example,
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:47.780]   that there were 3 million shipwrecks
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.540]   that have been mapped, Flint actually uses the word mapped,
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.580]   3 million shipwrecks that have been mapped
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.700]   at one point in the debate.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.820]   And I've put that clip into the video
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.340]   that I've brought out.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.020]   That is not a fact, that is an estimate, a UNESCO estimate.
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.780]   And actually in the small print
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.780]   on one of the slides that he has on the screen,
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.180]   you can see the word estimate,
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:12.220]   but he never expresses that word out loud.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.860]   So those who are listening to the podcast
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.700]   rather than watching it
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.140]   wouldn't even have a chance to see that.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.860]   And I sitting there in the studio
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.580]   didn't see that word estimate either.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.540]   And I didn't know that.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.580]   I thought, my God, Flint has a point here.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.140]   If there'd been 3 million shipwrecks found and mapped,
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:30.580]   if that's the case, the absence of any shipwreck
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.140]   from a lost civilization of the ice age is a problem.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:36.820]   But then I discovered that it isn't 3 million shipwrecks
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:37.900]   that have been mapped.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.420]   It's much, much less than that.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.420]   And maybe it's 250,000, still a large number,
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:46.220]   but most of them from the last thousand years.
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:49.900]   And unfortunately what Flint didn't go into,
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.700]   and perhaps he should have shared with the audience,
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.940]   and again, I go into this in the video,
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:57.140]   is that there is indisputable evidence
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.500]   that human beings were seafarers
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.100]   as much as 50 or 60,000 years ago.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.780]   The peopling of Australia involved a relatively short,
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.940]   90 kilometers, 100 kilometer ocean voyage,
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.900]   but nevertheless it was an ocean voyage.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:12.260]   And it must have involved a large enough people,
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.500]   a large enough number of people
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.780]   to create a permanent population that wouldn't go extinct.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.740]   The settlement of Cyprus is the same thing.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:22.740]   It was always an island, even during the ice age.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.140]   And no ships have survived
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:27.420]   that speak to the settlement of Australia,
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:28.780]   and no ships have survived
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.460]   that speak to the settlement of Cyprus either.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.700]   But that doesn't mean that that thing didn't happen.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.020]   - I should just like linger on this,
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:37.340]   because for me it was, the shipwrecks thing was convincing.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.420]   And then looking back, first of all, watching your video,
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.260]   but also just realizing the peopling of Australia part,
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:48.020]   that's mind-boggling to me, 50,000 years ago.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:51.440]   Just imagine being the person standing on the shore,
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.300]   looking out into the ocean,
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.340]   standing on the shore of a harsh environment,
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.980]   looking out to the ocean of a harsh environment,
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.680]   and deciding that, you know what,
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.420]   I'm going to go towards near certain death.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.740]   - I don't know what's on the other side of that water.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.580]   You can't see 90 kilometers.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.760]   - And humans did it.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.580]   - Yeah, and again, it's that urge to explore.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.300]   And I suggest that it probably began with a few pioneers
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.080]   who made the journey there and back.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.780]   They ventured into the water.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:20.740]   They definitely had boats.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.920]   And lo and behold, after a two or three day voyage,
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.500]   they ended up on a coastline.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.820]   You're an individual.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.700]   You've got my relatively straightforward island hopping
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.300]   with where each island is within sight of each other
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.660]   as far as Timor.
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:36.260]   And when you get to Timor,
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.060]   suddenly you can't island hop anymore.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.100]   There's an expansive ocean that you can't see across.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.900]   But that urge to explore that curiosity
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:48.820]   that is central to the human condition
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.680]   would undoubtedly have led some adventurous individuals
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.760]   to want to find out more
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.860]   and even be willing to risk their lives.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.040]   And that first reconnoitering
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.280]   of what lay beyond that strait
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.920]   would have undoubtedly been undertaken
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.440]   by very few individuals.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.880]   Not enough to create a permanent population in Australia.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.040]   But when they came back with the good news
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.200]   that there's a whole land there,
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:16.200]   that's the land that geographers call Sahul.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:21.260]   Which in just as Sunda was the ice age,
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.340]   Indonesian and Malaysian peninsula
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.420]   all joined together into one landmass.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:29.200]   So Sahul was New Guinea joined to Australia.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.920]   So they would have made landfall in New Guinea.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.500]   And then they think,
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.300]   well, here is this vast, open, incredible land.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.380]   We need to bring more people here.
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:43.760]   And that would have involved larger craft.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.400]   You need to bring people with resources
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.800]   and you need to bring enough of them,
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.560]   both men and women in order to produce a population
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.480]   that will not rapidly become extinct.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.320]   And it's the same in Cyprus.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.960]   There the detailed work that's been done
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.040]   suggests very strongly
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.320]   that we're looking at planned migrations
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.760]   of groups of people in excess of a thousand at a time,
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.680]   bringing animals with them.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.440]   And this certainly would have involved multiple boats
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.600]   and boats of a significant size.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.720]   - And there's no archeological evidence of those boats.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.560]   - None whatsoever.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.460]   The oldest boat that's ever been found in the world
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.140]   is the Dokos shipwreck off Greece,
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.760]   which is around 5,000 years old, if I recall correctly.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.480]   - So everything that makes a boat is lost to time.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.600]   - Yes, boats can be preserved under certain circumstances.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.560]   There's a wreck at the bottom of the Black Sea,
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.820]   almost two miles deep.
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.860]   I didn't know the Black Sea was that deep,
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:41.660]   but there's a wreck and there's no oxygen down there
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.340]   that is more than 2,000 years old
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:47.460]   and it is still in pretty much perfect condition.
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.880]   But in other conditions,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.780]   the structure of the ship evaporates.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:54.980]   Sometimes what you're left with is the cargo of the ship.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.240]   And you could say there was a ship that sank here,
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:00.660]   but the ship itself has gone.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:04.060]   The fact is we know that our ancestors were seafarers
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.980]   as much as 50,000 years ago
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.300]   and no ship has survived to testify to that,
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.460]   yet we accept that they were.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.700]   - Do you think one day we'll find a ship
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.360]   that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,000 years old?
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.380]   - It's not impossible.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.420]   I think it's quite unlikely,
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.940]   given the very thin survival of ships,
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.260]   the further back you go in time,
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:29.980]   with the oldest, as I say, being about 6,000 years old now.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:32.540]   And then the other thing to take into account
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:35.420]   is the Younger Dryas event itself
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:38.340]   and the cataclysmic circumstances of that event
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.540]   and the roiling of the seas
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.100]   that would have taken place then.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:47.880]   How much would have survived in a boat accident
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.580]   at that time would have survived
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:51.980]   for thousands of years afterwards, I'm not sure.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:55.120]   But I don't give up hope, it's possible.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.020]   - So, okay, so that's back to the three million shipwrecks.
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:40:59.860]   - Yeah.
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.500]   - So what's your takeaway from that debate?
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.140]   - Well, my takeaway from that debate
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.980]   is that I should have been better prepared
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.700]   and I should have been less angry.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:15.220]   I have to say that Flint had really disturbed me
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:21.060]   with these constant snide, not quite exact references
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.780]   to racism and white supremacism in my work.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:28.220]   I detest such things.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.620]   And to have those labels stuck on me,
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:33.540]   he's always avoided taking direct responsibility,
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.700]   pretty much always avoided.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:38.460]   There's one example that I include in the video I've made
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.060]   where he really hasn't successfully avoided it.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.820]   But in most cases, he's trying to say
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.860]   that I rely on sources that were racist,
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:48.880]   but that he's not saying that I myself am a racist.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.900]   But the end result of those statements
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:55.260]   is that people all around the world came to the conclusion
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:58.260]   that Graham Hancock is a racist and a white supremacist.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.140]   And that really got under my skin and it really upset me.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.020]   And I felt angry about it.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.220]   And I felt that I was there
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:08.060]   to defend "Ancient Apocalypse" season one.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.700]   Whereas in fact, what I was there to do
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.900]   was to listen to a series of lectures
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.900]   where an archeologist tells me what archeologists have found
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.740]   and that somehow I'm to deduce
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.540]   that from what they have found,
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:20.980]   they're not gonna find anything else,
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:23.620]   at least not anything to do with the lost civilization.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:24.660]   - Listen, I feel you.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.420]   I've seen the intensity of the attacks
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.220]   and the whole racism label.
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.940]   Is the one that can get under your skin.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:34.220]   And it's a toolbox has been prevalent over the past,
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:37.220]   let's say decade, maybe a little bit more
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:39.060]   as a method of cancellation.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.580]   When a person has the opposite of racist very often,
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.180]   it's kind of hilarious to watch,
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.980]   but it can get under your skin.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.580]   Especially when you have certain dynamics
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.880]   that happen on the internet,
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.580]   where it seeps into a Wikipedia page
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:56.340]   and then other people read that Wikipedia page
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.900]   and you get to hear it from like friends.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.900]   Oh, I didn't know you're at whatever.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.420]   And you realize that Wikipedia description of who you are
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:06.220]   is actually has a lot of power,
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:09.220]   not by people that know you well,
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:11.380]   but by people that just kind of are learning about you
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.260]   for the first time.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:13.100]   - Definitely.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.180]   - And they can really start to annoy you
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.420]   and get onto your skin when people are kind of
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:22.280]   indirectly injecting, they're writing articles about you.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.640]   They can then be cited by Wikipedia.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.200]   It can really bother a person
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.360]   who is actually trying to do good science
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.420]   or just trying to inspire people with different ideas.
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:33.460]   - I felt that my work was being deliberately misrepresented.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.180]   And I felt that I, as a human being,
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.260]   was being insulted and wronged
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.500]   in ways that are deeply hurtful.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.860]   My wife and I have six children between us
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.820]   and we have nine grandchildren.
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.500]   And of those nine grandchildren, seven are of mixed race.
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:54.180]   And this is my family.
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:55.680]   And these are kids who are gonna grow up
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.920]   and read Wikipedia and learn from reading Wikipedia
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.240]   that grandpa was some kind of racist.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.860]   This is a personal issue for me.
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:06.120]   And I'm afraid I carried that personal anger
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   into the debate and it made me less effective
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.040]   than I should have been.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.160]   But ultimately I do want to pay tribute to Flint.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.000]   He is an excellent debater.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.880]   He's got a very sharp mind.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.640]   He's a very clever man and he's very fast on his feet.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.100]   And I recognize that.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:25.980]   I was definitely up against a superior debater
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:26.820]   in that debate.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.160]   I'm not sure that I have those debating skills
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.480]   and I certainly didn't have them on that particular day.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.240]   I also admire about Flint something else,
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:37.680]   which is that he was willing to be there.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.660]   Most archaeologists don't want to talk to me at all.
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:42.200]   They want to insult me from the sidelines.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   They want to make sure that Wikipedia keeps on calling me
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.600]   a pseudo-archaeologist or a purveyor
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.520]   of pseudo-archaeological theories.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.340]   They want to make sure that the hints of racism are there,
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:54.580]   but they actually don't want to sit down and confront me.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:56.660]   At least Flint was willing to do that.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.900]   And I'm grateful to him for that.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.280]   And I think in that sense, it is an important encounter
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.180]   between people with, let's say,
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:04.460]   an alternative view of history
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.620]   and those with the very much mainstream view of history
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.420]   that archaeology gives us.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.020]   And he's also a very determined character.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.540]   He doesn't give up.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:17.540]   So all of those things about him I admire and respect.
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.340]   But I think he fought dirty during the debate.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.180]   And I've said exactly why in this video
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.860]   that I now have up on YouTube.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.100]   - To say a positive thing that I enjoyed,
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.740]   I think towards the end,
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.700]   and him speaking about agriculture was pretty interesting.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:37.540]   So the techniques of archaeology are pretty interesting,
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:42.260]   like where you can get some insights
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:45.980]   through the fog of time about what people were doing,
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.080]   how they were living.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:47.920]   That's pretty interesting.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.900]   - It's very interesting.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.180]   It's a very important discipline.
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:53.220]   And I've said many times before publicly,
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.560]   I couldn't do any of my work
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.900]   without the work that archaeologists do.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.460]   I emphasize very strongly in this video
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.360]   that I don't study what archaeologists study.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.660]   But nevertheless, the data that archaeologists
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.820]   have generated over the last century or so
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:12.260]   has been incredibly valuable to me in the work that I do.
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.260]   But when I look at the Great Sphinx
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.980]   and the studies of archaeology saying
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.060]   that this is the work of the pharaoh Khafre,
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.420]   despite the absence of any single contemporary inscription
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.020]   that ascribes it to Khafre,
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:25.060]   and in fact the presence of other inscriptions
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.540]   that say that it was already there in the time of Khufu,
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.700]   I am not looking at what Egyptologists study.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.940]   They just dismiss all of that
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:35.220]   and lock into the Khafre connection.
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:38.280]   At Gobekli Tepe, I'm not really looking
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.620]   at what archaeologists look at.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.660]   I'm looking at the alignments of the megaliths
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.460]   and how they seem to track procession of the star Sirius
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.900]   over a period of time.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:48.700]   Archaeologists aren't interested in any of that.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.940]   So I value and respect archaeology.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.240]   I think it's an incredible tool for investigating our past.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.500]   But I wish archaeologists would bring
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:00.060]   a slightly gentler frame of mind to it
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:02.260]   and a slightly opener perspective.
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:05.500]   And also that archaeologists would be willing
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:08.980]   to trust the general public to make up their own minds.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:11.340]   It's as though certain archaeologists
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:13.620]   are afraid of the public being presented
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.220]   with an alternative point of view,
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:18.500]   which they regard as quote unquote dangerous,
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.240]   because they somehow underestimate the intelligence
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.080]   of the general public
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.940]   and think the general public are just going to accept that.
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.940]   Actually, by condemning those alternative point of view,
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.940]   archaeologists make it much more likely
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.620]   that the general public will accept
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:32.780]   those alternative point of view,
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.860]   because there is a great distrust of experts
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:36.380]   in our society today.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:39.200]   And behaving in a snobbish, arrogant way,
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.460]   we archaeologists are the only people
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.020]   who are really qualified to speak about the past.
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:46.940]   And anybody else who speaks about the past is dangerous.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:51.380]   That actually is not helpful to archaeology in the long term.
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:52.780]   There could be a much more positive
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.420]   and a much more cooperative relationship.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:56.140]   And I can see that relationship
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:59.180]   with a gentleman like Ed Barnhart.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:04.180]   It was very much the case with archaeologist Marty Passanen
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:05.820]   from the University of Helsinki
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.740]   and with geographer Alceu Ranzi,
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:11.980]   Brazilian geographer, very, very senior figure,
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.380]   who I worked with in the Amazon
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.300]   for season two of "Ancient Apocalypse,"
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.060]   looking at these astonishing earthworks
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:19.740]   that have emerged from the Amazon jungle
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.780]   and which more and more are now being found with LIDAR.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.060]   Indeed, we found some of them ourselves with LIDAR
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.140]   while we were there.
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:28.580]   - Yeah, that was an incredible part of the show
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.080]   that I got a chance to preview.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.300]   It's like, there's all this earthworks.
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:37.660]   Yeah, the traces of things built on the ground
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:42.660]   that probably you can only really appreciate
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.120]   when you look from up above.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:44.960]   - That's right.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.240]   - So the idea that they built stuff
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:48.880]   that you can only appreciate when viewed from up above
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.820]   means they had a very kind of deep relationship
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:55.180]   with the sky.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.020]   - With the sky.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:56.860]   - Yeah.
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:58.600]   - And a very good knowledge of geometry as well,
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:00.460]   because these are geometrical structures.
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:03.160]   And some of them even seem to incorporate
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:07.200]   geometrical games, almost like squaring the circle.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:10.560]   It's not quite that, but you have a lovely square earthwork
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.600]   with a lovely circle earthwork right in the middle of it.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.520]   Whatever else they were, they were geometers.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.220]   They were not just builders of fantastically huge earthworks
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.660]   that nobody expected in the Amazon,
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:25.280]   not just builders of cities
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.520]   that we now know existed in the Amazon,
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.020]   but that they were astronomers and mathematicians as well.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.040]   - Everything we're talking about is so full of mystery.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.620]   It's just fascinating, especially the farther back we go.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:38.520]   - That's what I love about the past
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.680]   is the mystery that's there.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.300]   And that's another thing that I regret
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:44.780]   about some archeologists is that their mission seems to be
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:48.320]   to drain all mystery out of the past,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.480]   to suck it dry like some kind of vampire,
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.040]   sucking the blood out of the past
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.400]   and to reduce it to a series of numbers
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.720]   that appear to be scientific.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.880]   I think that's most unfortunate.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.760]   The past is deeply mysterious.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.140]   The whole story of life on earth is deeply mysterious.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:10.580]   I mean, we were talking about the timeline of human beings,
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:14.820]   but if you go back to the formation of the earth itself,
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:17.060]   if I've got the figures right,
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.700]   it's about four and a half billion years ago
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.740]   that the earth supposedly formed.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:26.460]   It was then incredibly hot and inhospitable to life
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:29.620]   for the next several hundred million years.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.960]   But it was actually Francis Crick
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.680]   who pointed out something odd
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:37.200]   that within a hundred million years
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.840]   of the earth being cool enough to support life,
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.400]   there's bacterial life all over the planet.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.080]   And Crick wrote a book called "Life Itself"
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.160]   that was published in 1981.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.640]   And he suggested that life had been brought here
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.380]   by a process of panspermia.
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:58.160]   Now that's an idea that's around in circulation
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.360]   that comets may carry bacteria
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.180]   which can seed life on planets.
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.840]   But Crick actually in "Life Itself"
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.320]   was talking about directed panspermia.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.560]   He envisaged, this is Crick, not me.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.640]   He envisaged an alien civilization
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.760]   far away across the galaxy, which faced extinction.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.720]   Perhaps a supernova was gonna go off in the neighborhood.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.200]   They were highly advanced.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.400]   Their first thought might've been,
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.760]   let's get ourselves off the planet
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.280]   and go and populate some other planet.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:32.160]   But the distances of interstellar space were so great.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.920]   So their second thought was, let's preserve our DNA.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.920]   Let's put bacteria, genetically engineered bacteria
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:43.480]   into cryogenic chambers
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.880]   and fire them off into the universe in all directions.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.440]   And bottom line of Crick's theory in "Life Itself"
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.040]   is one of those cryogenic containers
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.600]   containing bacterial life from another solar system
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.040]   crashed into the early earth.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.800]   That's why life began so suddenly here on earth.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.440]   - If we as a human civilization continue,
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:06.440]   I think that is a one way to create backups of us
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.760]   elsewhere in the universe,
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:12.880]   given the space is to do a life gun and shoot it everywhere.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.680]   And then it just plants.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:17.160]   And you kind of hope that whatever is the magic
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.160]   that makes up human consciousness,
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.800]   and if that magic is already there in the initial DNA
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.800]   of the bacteria.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:29.240]   - The potential for that magic is there.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:30.280]   - The potential is there.
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.160]   - And evolutionary forces will work upon it
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.200]   in different ways in different environments.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.440]   But the potential is there.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.280]   Yes, it's something that we would do.
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.400]   If we were facing a complete extinction of life
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.680]   on planet earth, a major global effort would be made
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.720]   to preserve it somehow.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:52.480]   And that might well include firing off cryogenic chambers
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:54.200]   into the universe and hoping that some of them
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.120]   would land somewhere hospitable.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:57.520]   - And as you were mentioning,
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.480]   there's just so many interesting mysteries
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.680]   along the way here.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.680]   For example, I mean, it's like three billion years,
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:07.760]   it was single cell organisms.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.840]   So it seems like life is pretty good
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.460]   for single cell organisms,
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.840]   that there's no need for multicellularity,
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.920]   that like for animals, for any of this kind of stuff.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.340]   So why is that?
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.440]   It seems like you could adapt much better
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.200]   if you're a more complicated organism.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.360]   It took a really long time to take that leap.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.680]   Is it because it's really hard to do?
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.680]   And what was the forcing function to do that kind of leap?
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:36.080]   And the same, I mean, for us to be selfish
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.160]   and self-obsessed, for us humans,
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.400]   like what was the magic leap to Homo sapiens
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.600]   from the other hominids?
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.720]   And why did Homo sapiens win out
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.340]   against the androthals and the other competitors?
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.000]   Why are they not around anymore?
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.360]   So those are all fascinating mysteries.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.760]   And it feels like the more we propose
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.880]   sort of radical ideas about our past
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:04.720]   and take it seriously and explore,
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:07.680]   the more we'll be able to sort of figure out that puzzle
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:10.360]   that leads all the way back to Homo sapiens
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:13.520]   and maybe all the way back to the origin of life on earth.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.840]   - Yeah, I think that Homo sapiens is the tail end
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.920]   of a very long, deep series of mysteries
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.420]   that goes back right to the beginning of life
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:25.920]   on this planet and probably long before, actually,
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:27.640]   because this planet is part of the universe
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:31.080]   and God knows what else is out there in the universe.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:35.280]   - Why do you think Homo sapiens evolved?
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:37.840]   Like what was the magic thing?
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.560]   So there's a bunch of theories about fire
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:43.920]   leading to meat, to cooking, which can fuel the brain.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.800]   That's one.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.720]   The other is like social interaction.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.000]   We're able to use our imagination to construct ideas
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.280]   and share those ideas and tell great stories.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.080]   And that is somehow an evolutionary advantage.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.520]   Do you have any like favorite conception of--
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.920]   - Well, it's interesting.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.600]   There's no doubt that anatomically modern humans
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.680]   and Neanderthals coexisted in Europe
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.840]   for at least 10,000 years, probably more than that.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.120]   And yet one of the popular views
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.160]   is that anatomically modern humans
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.280]   wiped out the Neanderthals, that we killed them off.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.640]   But at the same time,
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.440]   we were into breeding with the Neanderthals.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.920]   In a sense, the Neanderthals are not gone.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.240]   They are still within us today.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:28.400]   We are part Neanderthal.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.960]   There's another theory that I've read about.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.080]   There is some evidence that Neanderthals were cannibals,
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.560]   that there was ritual cannibalism took place
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.480]   amongst Neanderthals,
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.840]   and particularly the eating of human brains.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.520]   And this can cause Kuru,
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.840]   which can kill off whole populations.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.000]   That's another suggestion
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.160]   of why the Neanderthals died out.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.120]   There's lots of possibilities that have been put forward.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.240]   Maybe we just out-competed them.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:58.440]   Maybe anatomically modern humans
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.440]   had some brain connections that they didn't have,
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:03.040]   even though the Neanderthal brain was bigger
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.280]   than the brain of anatomically modern human beings.
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.720]   As the old saying goes, size isn't everything.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.160]   Maybe we just had a more compact, more efficient brain.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.160]   The fact of the matter is that Neanderthals and Denisovans
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.280]   did not survive the rise of Homo sapiens.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.360]   - For our discussion, though,
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.040]   what is interesting is all the hominids
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.960]   seem to be explorers.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.800]   - Yes.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:27.640]   - They spread.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.840]   I mean, I didn't know this.
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.280]   - The fact that Homo erectus was all over the planet
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.480]   more than a million years ago is testament to that.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.840]   And I do think that exploration urge
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.080]   is fundamental to humanity.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.000]   And I would like to say that's what I think I'm doing.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000]   I'm exercising my urge to explore the past in my own way,
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000]   making my own path and defining my own route.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.220]   - That's the leap from non-human to human.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:02.600]   One of the things you've discussed is your idea
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.840]   of what was the leap to human civilization.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840]   What is the driver?
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.400]   What is the inspiration for humans to form civilizations?
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.320]   And for you, that's shamanism.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:13.160]   - Definitely.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.000]   - Can you explain what that means?
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.120]   - I think that shamanism is the origin
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.120]   of everything of value in humanity.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.040]   I think it was the earliest form of science.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:30.960]   When I spend time with shamans in the Amazon,
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.160]   I observe people who are constantly experimenting
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.220]   with plants in a very scientific way.
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:40.280]   They're always trying a pinch of this and a pinch of that
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.880]   in different forms, for example, of the ayahuasca brew
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.880]   to see if it enhances it or makes it different in any way.
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.960]   The invention of curare is a remarkable scientific feat,
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:55.880]   which is entirely down to shamans in the Amazon.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:59.680]   They are the scientists of the hunter-forager
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.120]   state of society.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:08.120]   And they were the ancient leaders of human civilization.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:13.480]   So I think all civilization arises out of shamanism.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:16.600]   And shamanism is a naturally scientific endeavor
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:19.320]   where experimentation is undertaken and exploration
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:22.040]   and investigation of the environment around us.
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:25.880]   And what I'm suggesting is that one group,
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:28.000]   perhaps more than one group,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.520]   went a bit further than other groups did
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.440]   and used that study of the skies
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:36.880]   and developed navigational techniques
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.560]   and were able to sail and explore the Earth.
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.120]   But that ultimately, what lies behind it
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:47.120]   is the same curiosity and investigative skill
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:51.280]   that shamans are still using in the Amazon to this day.
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.480]   And I do see them as scientists
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.880]   in a very proper use of the word.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.840]   - But do you think something like ayahuasca
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.760]   was a part of that process?
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.760]   - Yes, ayahuasca is the result of shamanistic investigation
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.720]   of what's available in the Amazon.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.200]   Of course, ayahuasca is all the fad
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.880]   in Western industrialized societies today.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.720]   And some people see it as a miracle cure
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.680]   for all kinds of ailments and problems.
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.240]   And perhaps it is, perhaps it can be in certain ways.
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.880]   Ayahuasca itself is not an Amazonian word.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.480]   It comes from the Quechua language
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:32.880]   and it means the vine of souls or the vine of the dead.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.800]   But the ayahuasca vine is only one
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:39.440]   of two principal ingredients in the ayahuasca brew.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.480]   And the other ingredient are leaves
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:44.240]   that contain dimethyltryptamine.
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.220]   And there are two sources of that.
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:49.120]   One is a bush called Cicotria viridis,
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.360]   that's its botanical name.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.800]   They call it chacruna in the Amazon.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.040]   And its leaves are rich in dimethyltryptamine DMT,
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:59.360]   which is arguably the most powerful psychedelic
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:00.640]   known to science.
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:05.800]   And the other source comes from another vine,
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.280]   Diplopteris cabrerana,
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:12.480]   which the leaves of that vine also contain DMT.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.880]   So the ayahuasca vine on its own
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:17.960]   is not going to give you a visionary journey.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:20.960]   And the leaves that contain DMT on their own,
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.640]   whether they come from Diplopteris
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:24.560]   or whether they come from chacruna
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.680]   are not gonna give you a visionary journey.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.960]   And the reason they're not gonna give you
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.000]   the visionary journey
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.080]   is because of the enzyme monoamine oxidase in the gut
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.120]   that shuts down DMT when absorbed orally.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:39.120]   Basically DMT is not accessible orally
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:44.080]   unless you combine it with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.000]   And that's what I mean when I'm talking about science
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:46.840]   in the Amazon.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.120]   'Cause there's so many tens of thousands,
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.280]   hundreds of thousands different species
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:51.720]   of plants and trees in the Amazon.
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:53.840]   And they've gone around and they found
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.600]   just two or three of them that put together
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.040]   can produce these extraordinary visionary experiences.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.680]   - Just imagine the number of plants they had to have eaten.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.520]   - Yeah.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.560]   - It consumed and smoked
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.280]   or all kinds of combinations to arrive at that.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:08.400]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:11.640]   To realize that this is something very special.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:14.280]   And then to use the principles there
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.460]   to find another form of it.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:19.040]   So ayahuasca is the form that is made
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:23.060]   with the ayahuasca vine and the leaves of the shakuna plant.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:26.960]   But yaje is made from the ayahuasca vine
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.100]   and the leaves of another vine, Diplopteris cabrerana,
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:33.580]   which contain not only NN-DMT,
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:35.720]   which is the DMT that everybody's
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.240]   pretty much familiar with these days,
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.760]   but also 5-MeO-DMT and the yaje experience,
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.760]   which I have also had in my view is more intense
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.540]   and more powerful almost to the point of being overwhelming
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.920]   than the ayahuasca experience.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.240]   But what the result of this sophisticated chemistry
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:03.240]   that we find taking place here is a brew
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.780]   which is hideous to drink.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:09.580]   The taste, I find it quite repulsive.
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:15.400]   I almost retch just smelling it in the cup.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:20.120]   But then unleashes these extraordinary experiences.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.440]   And it isn't just pretty visuals.
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:27.440]   It's the sense of encounters with sentient others,
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.000]   that there are sentient beings,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.280]   that somehow we're surrounded by a realm of sentience
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.880]   that is not normally accessible to us.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.680]   And that what the ayahuasca brew
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:38.980]   and certain other psychedelics,
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:42.400]   like some psilocybin mushrooms in a high enough dose
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.440]   can do it as well, LSD can do it.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:49.440]   But ayahuasca is the master in this of lowering the veil
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.400]   to what appears to be a seamlessly convincing other realm,
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.360]   other world.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.920]   And of course the hardline rational scientists
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.540]   will say that's just all fantasies of your brain.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.680]   But I don't think we fully understand
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.840]   or even close to understanding exactly what consciousness is.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:10.560]   And I remain open to two possibilities,
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.520]   that consciousness is generated by the brain,
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.360]   is made by the brain in the way that a factory makes cars.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.760]   But I also am open to the possibility
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:22.200]   that the brain is a receiver of consciousness,
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:23.480]   just as a television set
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.240]   is the receiver of television signals.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.040]   And that if that is the case,
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.120]   then we locked into the physical realm,
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.760]   we need our everyday alert problem-solving
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.720]   state of consciousness.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.420]   And that's the state of consciousness
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:45.420]   that Western civilization values and highly encourages.
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:50.260]   But these other states of consciousness
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:54.360]   that allow us to access alternative realities
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.640]   are possibly more important.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:59.140]   It may be apocryphal,
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:03.900]   but it was reported after Francis Crick's role
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:07.260]   and his Nobel Prize for the discovery of the double helix,
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:10.740]   that he finally got it under the influence of LSD.
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:13.100]   There's the classic example of Carey Mullis
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.180]   and the polymerase chain reaction.
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:18.420]   He said he got that under the influence of LSD.
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:20.620]   So the notion that the alert problem-solving
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:21.580]   state of consciousness
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:23.660]   is the only valuable state of consciousness
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:27.380]   is disproved by valuable experiences
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:30.180]   that people have had in a visionary state.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:33.100]   But the question that remains unresolved
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:36.580]   is those entities that we encounter
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:38.500]   in the, and not everybody encounters them,
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.060]   and you're certainly not going to encounter them
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:41.360]   on every Ayahuasca trip.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.640]   There are Ayahuasca journeys where nothing seems to happen.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.060]   I suspect something does happen,
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.780]   but it happens at a subconscious level.
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:52.560]   I know that shamans in the Amazon regard those trips
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.280]   where actually you don't see visions
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:56.020]   as amongst the most valuable.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:57.500]   And they say you are learning stuff
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.700]   that you're not remembering,
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.900]   but you're learning it anyway.
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:04.780]   These sentient others that are encountered,
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.580]   what are they?
[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:09.560]   Are they just figments of our brain on drugs?
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:13.220]   Or are we actually gaining access to a parallel reality
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.380]   which is inhabited by consciousness
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:18.540]   which is in a non-physical form?
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:21.500]   And I'm equally open to that idea.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:25.420]   I think that may be what is going on here with Ayahuasca.
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:30.420]   But the other thing is that there is a presence
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:32.540]   within the Ayahuasca brew,
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:37.540]   and she is present both in Ayahuasca and in Yahé.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.020]   And that's one of the reasons why the shamans say
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.100]   that actually the master of the process
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:44.660]   is the Ayahuasca vine, not the leaves.
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.020]   It's as though the vine has harnessed the leaves
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:49.300]   to gain access to human consciousness.
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.700]   And there, if you have sufficient exposure
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:55.820]   to Ayahuasca or Yahé, you drink it enough times,
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:00.820]   I've had maybe 75 or 80 journeys with Ayahuasca,
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.740]   you definitely start to feel an intelligent presence
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:09.220]   with a definite personality, which I interpret as feminine
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:12.340]   and which most people in the West interpreted as feminine
[02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:14.340]   and they call her Mother Ayahuasca.
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:15.720]   There are some tribes in the Amazon
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:18.820]   who interpret the spirit of Ayahuasca as male,
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:22.740]   but in all cases, that spirit is seen as a teacher.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.700]   That's fundamentally what Ayahuasca is.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:28.820]   It's a teacher, and it teaches moral lessons.
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.360]   And that's fascinating,
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.060]   that a mixture of two plants
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:34.740]   should cause us to reflect on our own behavior
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.780]   and how it may have hurt and damaged and affected others
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.440]   and fill us with a powerful wish
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:43.580]   not to repeat that negative behavior again in the future.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.500]   The more baggage you carry in your life,
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:50.840]   the harder the beating the Ayahuasca is going to give you
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.300]   until it forces you to confront
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:56.420]   and take responsibility for your own behavior.
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:59.380]   And that is an extraordinary thing
[02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:02.700]   to come from a plant brew in that way.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:07.700]   And I think in, yes, I think Ayahuasca is the most powerful
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:10.180]   of all the plant medicines
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:12.640]   for accessing these mysterious realms,
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.820]   but there's no doubt you can access them.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.060]   They're all tryptamines.
[02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:18.220]   They're all related to one another in one way.
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:20.060]   You can access them through LSD,
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.420]   and you certainly can access them
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:24.840]   through psilocybe mushrooms as well in large enough dose.
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:27.500]   - Both possibilities, as you describe, are interesting.
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:30.380]   And to me, they're kind of akin to each other.
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:36.740]   I wonder what the limit of the brain's capacity
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:38.600]   is to create imaginary worlds
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:42.020]   and treat them seriously and make them real
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:45.760]   and in those worlds explore
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.040]   and have real sort of moral, deep brainstorming sessions
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:53.540]   with those entities.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:57.260]   So it's almost like the power of the human mind
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:01.180]   to imagine taken to its limit.
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:02.500]   - It is.
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:06.880]   And the curious thing is that the same iconography,
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:10.060]   people paint their visions after Ayahuasca sessions.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:12.700]   People were painting in Europe,
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.940]   in the cave of Lascaux, for example,
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:18.100]   and of course they had access to psilocybe mushrooms
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.340]   in prehistoric Europe.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:23.460]   There's a remarkable commonality
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:25.620]   in the imagery that is painted.
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:28.740]   I like to give credit where credit is due
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:31.100]   and there are two names that need to be mentioned here.
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.380]   One is the late, great Terence McKenna
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:35.140]   and his book, "Food of the Gods,"
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:38.140]   where he proposed the idea very strongly
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:41.120]   that it was our ancestral encounters with psychedelics
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:42.700]   that made us fully human.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:46.980]   That's what switched on the modern human mind.
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:49.220]   And very much the same idea began to be explored
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:51.980]   a bit earlier by Professor David Lewis Williams
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:54.700]   at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:57.740]   Fabulous book called "The Mind in the Cave,"
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:01.660]   where he is again arguing that these astonishing similarities
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:04.780]   in cave art and rock art all around the world
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:07.300]   can only be properly explained
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:11.540]   by people in deeply altered states of consciousness
[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:14.140]   attempting to remember when they return
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:16.540]   to a normal everyday state of consciousness,
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.500]   attempting to remember their visions
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:21.180]   and document them on permanent media
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:22.740]   like the wall of a cave.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:25.660]   So typically you get a lot of geometric patterns
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.300]   but you also got entities
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:30.420]   and those entities often are therianthropes,
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:34.060]   part animal, part human in form.
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:35.660]   Might have the head of a wolf
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:37.900]   and the body of a human being,
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:39.460]   might have the head of a bird
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.180]   and the body of a human being and so on and so forth
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:45.740]   and that they communicate with us in the visionary state.
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:48.980]   Interestingly, although this sounds like woo-woo
[02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:52.420]   and it is an area that most scientists would steer clear of
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:53.900]   at risk of their careers,
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.180]   there is very serious work now being done
[02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.140]   at Imperial College in London
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:02.220]   and at the University of California at San Diego
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:06.420]   where volunteers are being given extended DMT.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:10.140]   There's a new technology, DMT-X,
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:14.580]   where the DMT is fed directly into the bloodstream by drip
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:17.260]   and it's possible to keep the individual
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.500]   in the peak DMT state,
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.620]   which normally when you smoke or vape DMT,
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:24.220]   you're looking if you're lucky at 10 minutes
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:27.540]   or if you're unlucky, if it's a bad journey
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.740]   because those 10 minutes can seem like forever.
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:33.300]   But with DMT-X,
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:36.140]   with the drip feeding of DMT into the bloodstream,
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:37.860]   these volunteers actually could be kept
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:40.220]   in the peak state for hours.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:43.620]   And unlike LSD, where you rapidly build up tolerance,
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:45.700]   nobody ever builds up tolerance to DMT,
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.380]   it always hits you with the same power.
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.500]   Even if you took it yesterday and the day before
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.220]   and you're taking it tomorrow as well,
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:52.860]   it's still gonna have that same power,
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.900]   there's no tolerance there.
[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:57.100]   So that's how they can use that lack of tolerance
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.820]   to keep volunteers in this state.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.820]   And then when they debrief those volunteers,
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.820]   they're also putting them in MRI scanners
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:05.700]   and looking at what's happening in the brain.
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:07.180]   But when they debrief them,
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:10.820]   they're all talking about encounters with sentient others.
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:13.260]   There's even a group now called sentient others
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:14.300]   where people are exchanging,
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.180]   volunteers are now exchanging their experiences.
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:18.900]   They weren't allowed to do so
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:19.980]   at the beginning of the experiment,
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:22.020]   but now that most of them have left it,
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:23.460]   they're exchanging their experiences.
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:26.300]   And it's all about encounters with insentient others
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:28.820]   who wish to teach them moral lessons.
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:30.980]   Now, to me, that's wild.
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:32.740]   What is going on here?
[02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:36.460]   How do we account for this?
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:38.820]   Yeah, I get the notion of hallucinations
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:40.620]   and brightly colored visuals,
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.500]   but the moral lessons that come with it,
[02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:43.780]   those are very odd.
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.660]   - Yeah, and would you say that the reason
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:48.780]   that could give birth to a civilization,
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:53.780]   is it because such visions can help create myths
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:57.060]   and especially like religious myths
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:59.340]   that would be a cohesive thing
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:02.380]   for a large group of people to get around?
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:04.300]   - Yeah, and can help us to be better members
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:05.140]   of our own community.
[02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:06.260]   - Right, with the moral lessons.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:09.660]   - Yeah, more contributing members of our community,
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.980]   more caring, more nurturing members of our community.
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:14.740]   That's got to be good for any community.
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:16.820]   I've said this a dozen times,
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:18.940]   but I'll say it again.
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:22.020]   If I had the power to do so,
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:26.460]   I would make it a law, an absolute law,
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:29.860]   that anybody running for a powerful political position,
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.020]   particularly if that position is president
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:34.180]   or head of state in any kind of way,
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.820]   that that person has to undergo the Ayahuasca ordeal first.
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.460]   They have to have 10 or 12 sessions of Ayahuasca
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.300]   as a condition for applying for the job.
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:50.180]   I suspect that most who had had those experiences
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:53.420]   wouldn't want to apply for the job anymore.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:55.420]   They would want to live a different kind of life.
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:57.540]   And those who did want to carry on
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:00.340]   being a leader of a nation would be very different people
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:03.460]   from the people who are leading the nations of the earth
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.140]   into chaos and destruction today.
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.740]   - Yeah, they would be doing it for the right reasons.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.860]   I mentioned to you, I recently interviewed Donald Trump
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:13.980]   and actually brought up this same idea
[02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:15.660]   that it would be a much better world
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:17.940]   if most of Congress and most politicians
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:20.420]   would take some form of psychedelics at the very least.
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:22.740]   - I have no doubt that it would be a better world.
[02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:24.620]   I mean, this raises an interesting point,
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:27.020]   which is the role of government
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:29.240]   in controlling our consciousness.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:34.940]   And in my opinion, the so-called war on drugs
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:38.380]   is one of the fundamental abuses of human rights
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:42.260]   that have been undertaken in the past 60 years.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.700]   It should be a Republican issue.
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:46.140]   If I understand the Republican Party correctly,
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:49.180]   the Republican Party believes in individual freedom
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:51.420]   for adults as much as possible,
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.180]   and particularly the freedom to make choices
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:55.900]   over their own bodies.
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:59.060]   But in the case of even cannabis,
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:00.980]   I know that's one of the great things
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.420]   that's happening in America.
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:04.660]   It's happening state by state
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:07.020]   where cannabis is being legalized
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.700]   and that draconian hand of government
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:10.740]   is being taken off the back of people
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:12.900]   who are consuming a medicine
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:15.420]   that is far less harmful than alcohol,
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.540]   which is glorified in our society.
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:22.300]   We cannot say that we are free
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:24.980]   if we allow a government to dictate to us
[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:27.540]   what experiences we may or may not have
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:31.100]   in our inner consciousness while doing no harm to others.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:35.180]   And the point there is we already have a whole raft of laws
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:37.740]   that deal with us when we do harm to others.
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:40.020]   Do we really need laws that tell us
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:42.220]   what we may or may not experience
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:44.140]   in the inner sanctum of our own consciousness?
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:48.300]   I think it's a fundamental violation of adult sovereignty.
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:51.900]   And we would have much less drug problems
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:55.620]   if these drugs were all legalized
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:59.020]   and made available to people without shaming them,
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.940]   without punishing them in any way,
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:03.860]   but just part of normal social life.
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:04.980]   And then you could be sure
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:06.660]   that you were getting good product
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:08.460]   rather than really shitty product,
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.380]   which has been cut with all sorts of other things.
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:13.780]   Ultimately, the way forward is for adults
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:16.920]   to take responsibility for their own behavior
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.780]   and for society to allow that to happen
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:22.300]   and not to have big government taking responsibility
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.860]   for decisions that should be in the hands of individuals.
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:26.180]   - And for me also, it's exciting,
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:29.420]   some of these substances like psilocybin
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:32.860]   are being integrated into scientific studies at large scales.
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:33.700]   It's really interesting.
[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:34.660]   - We've seen a revolution
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:36.780]   in the way science looks at psychedelics
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:38.960]   in the last 20, 25 years.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.100]   They were in that highly demonized category.
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.260]   But again, it's one of those paradigms
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:47.060]   which gets overwhelmed by new evidence.
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:48.900]   And it began to be realized
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.480]   that psilocybin and other psychedelics
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:55.320]   are very helpful in a range of conditions
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:57.100]   from which people suffer.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:59.740]   Post-traumatic stress disorder,
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:02.260]   the fear of death when you're suffering
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:05.060]   from terminal cancer can be overwhelming.
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:10.060]   And it's been found that psilocybin can remove that.
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:14.020]   Deep depressions can be evaporated
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:17.220]   with one single massive psilocybin journey.
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:18.100]   They just go away.
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:19.780]   There's really good science on this.
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:21.060]   And they are being integrated
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:22.640]   into conventional medicine more and more.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:23.480]   We'll see it happening.
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:25.500]   I'm not sure if it'll happen as much as,
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.780]   as fast as I would like to see it happen in my lifetime,
[02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:29.340]   but it is gonna happen.
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:31.540]   - Yeah, actually, just recently found out
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:36.540]   that you had a TED talk, "War on Consciousness,"
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.780]   that was taken down.
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:41.820]   And that was just part of just the general resistance.
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:44.620]   'Cause it was a pretty, it wasn't a radical,
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:45.460]   it wasn't really a radical talk.
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:47.300]   - No, I was talking about ayahuasca,
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:50.380]   and I was talking about the view that I hold very strongly,
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.880]   that as long as we do no harm to others,
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.060]   sovereign adults should be allowed to make decisions
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.380]   about their own bodies and not face a jail sentence
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:16:59.380]   or shaming as the result.
[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:02.580]   But this, so it was a TEDx talk, not a TED talk,
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.900]   organized by a local TED group.
[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:07.220]   They call them TEDx talks.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:12.220]   And I gave this talk about the war on consciousness.
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:16.540]   And it was immediately pulled down from TED's main channel
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:19.820]   with all kinds of bizarre reasons being given.
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:21.220]   But unfortunately it was too late
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:23.620]   because a number of people had already downloaded the talk
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:26.220]   and then uploaded it onto other YouTube channels.
[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:29.340]   And actually their banning of it made it go viral
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:31.860]   in a way that would not have happened otherwise.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:34.220]   But again, it's a sign that points of view
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:37.700]   that are not acceptable to those in positions of power
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:40.460]   are simply dismissed and shut down,
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:43.500]   or at least attempts are made to do so.
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:45.740]   - In general, just along that line of thinking,
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:47.940]   I'm pretty sure that what we understand
[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:50.420]   about consciousness today will seem silly
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:53.420]   to humans 100 years from now.
[02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:54.860]   - You bet it will.
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:57.560]   Especially if we harness psychedelics
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.420]   to investigate consciousness.
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:04.420]   And that is what is happening at Imperial College right now
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:07.940]   is the investigation of the experience.
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:10.140]   They're not looking, there are other trials
[02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:12.380]   that are looking for the therapeutic potential of DNT,
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:14.740]   but in this case, they're looking entirely
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.380]   at the experiences that people have
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:18.340]   and why they're so similar from people
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:21.060]   from different age groups and different genders
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:22.140]   and different parts of the world
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:23.860]   are all having the same experiences.
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:26.280]   - And for me, from an engineer perspective,
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.420]   it's interesting if it's possible
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:31.260]   to engineer consciousness in artificial beings.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:32.100]   - Yeah.
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:34.860]   - It's another way to approach the question
[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:37.540]   of how special is human consciousness?
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:38.380]   - Yeah.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:42.180]   - From where does it arise?
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:44.740]   Is it something that permeates all of life?
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.060]   And then in that case, what is the thing
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.140]   that makes life special?
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:49.160]   Like, what is life?
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.100]   What is these living organisms that we have here
[02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:54.460]   and that evolved to create humans?
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:57.100]   What is truly special about humans?
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:59.440]   And it's both scary and exciting
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.520]   to consider the possibility
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.200]   that we can create something like this.
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.680]   - Yeah, but why not?
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:07.000]   We're a vehicle for consciousness, in my view.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.320]   I think consciousness is present in all life on Earth.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.680]   I don't think it's limited to human beings.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.780]   We have the equipment to manifest
[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:16.160]   and express that consciousness
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.620]   in the way that a dog, for example, doesn't have
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:21.600]   or a snail doesn't have or a pigeon doesn't have.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.380]   But when I look at two pigeons sitting on my garden fence
[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:27.780]   and rubbing up close to each other
[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:29.180]   and enjoying each other's company
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:31.660]   and taking off together and hanging out together,
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:34.020]   I think they're conscious beings.
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:37.340]   And I think consciousness is everywhere.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:38.940]   I think it's the basis of everything.
[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:41.660]   And I suspect that fundamentally,
[02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:44.100]   consciousness is non-physical
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.980]   and that it can manifest in physical forms
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:48.660]   where it can then have experiences
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:51.400]   that would not be available in the non-physical state.
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:52.620]   That's a guess.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:54.060]   - That'd be a fascinating,
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:56.620]   because then you can construct all kinds of physical forms
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:57.860]   to manifest the consciousness.
[02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:59.740]   - And see if consciousness enters,
[02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:01.020]   if they become consciousness.
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:03.300]   Isn't there some suggestion that artificial intelligence
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:04.860]   is already becoming conscious?
[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:07.420]   - That makes humans really uncomfortable.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:09.460]   Because we are at the top of the food chain,
[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:11.220]   we consider ourselves truly special,
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.100]   and to consider that there's other things
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:16.340]   that could be special is scary.
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:19.500]   - Well, look how other people make us uncomfortable, too.
[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:22.280]   I mean, look at the state of the world today.
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:25.580]   All the conflicts that are raging,
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:27.520]   that's because we're afraid.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:30.000]   When I say we, I'm speaking nation by nation.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.960]   We are afraid of other people.
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:33.800]   We fear that they're going to hurt us
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:34.960]   or damage us in some way.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:36.560]   And so we seek to stop that.
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.720]   It's the root of many, many conflicts, this fear.
[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:42.840]   And so fear of AI may not be such a good idea.
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.400]   After all, it might be very interesting
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.000]   to go down that route and see where it comes.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.520]   Certainly, in terms of exploring consciousness,
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:50.240]   it is very interesting.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:53.320]   - Yeah, fear is a useful thing,
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:54.880]   but it can also be destructive.
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.320]   - Well, it can be destructive,
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:58.520]   and it can shut you down completely.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.320]   - If you look into the future,
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:01.640]   maybe the next hundred years,
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:03.720]   what do you hope are the interesting discoveries
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:06.520]   in archeology that we'll find?
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:07.820]   - Well, I'd really like to know
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.820]   how the Great Pyramid was built.
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:14.480]   And we now have, with new tech, with scanning technology,
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.780]   it's now become apparent that there are many major voids
[02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:19.520]   within the Great Pyramid.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:20.840]   Right above the Grand Gallery,
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:23.420]   there's what looks like a second Grand Gallery
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:26.400]   that has been identified with remote scanning.
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:31.560]   And new chambers, one of them has even been opened up
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.880]   already, are being found as a result of this.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:37.280]   So it may be that the Great Pyramid
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:39.640]   will ultimately give up its secrets.
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:41.040]   I often think that the Great Pyramid
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.560]   is partly designed to do that.
[02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:47.440]   It's designed to invite its own initiates.
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:50.800]   Some people aren't interested in the Great Pyramid at all,
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.760]   but some people are fascinated by it,
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:53.760]   and they're drawn towards it.
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:54.920]   And when they're drawn towards it,
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.760]   it immediately starts raising questions in their minds,
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.340]   and they seek answers to their questions.
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:02.400]   So it's like saying, "Here I stand.
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:06.520]   "Investigate me, find out about me, figure out what I am.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.900]   "Why have I got these two shafts
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:11.800]   "cut into the side of the so-called Queen's Chamber?
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.340]   "Why do they slope up
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:14.680]   "through the body of the Great Pyramid?
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.580]   "Why do they not exit on the outside of the Great Pyramid?
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:20.040]   "Why, when we send a robot up those shafts,
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:22.260]   "do we find them after about 160 feet
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.240]   "blocked by a door with metal handles?
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:26.940]   "Why, when we drill through that door
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:29.820]   "to see what's beyond it, three or four feet away,
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:31.840]   "we see another door?"
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:35.700]   It's very frustrating, but it's saying to us,
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:36.920]   "Keep on exploring.
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.960]   "If you're persistent enough,
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.600]   "we'll eventually give you the answer."
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:43.280]   So I'm hoping that that answer will come
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:45.680]   as to how this most mysterious of monuments
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:49.680]   was actually built and the inspiration that lay behind it.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.680]   Certainly, I'm sure it was never a tomb or a tomb only.
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:58.560]   The later pyramids might have been.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.120]   Actually, no pharaonic burial
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:01.840]   has been discovered in any pyramid,
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:04.680]   but nevertheless, it's pretty clear
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:05.700]   that the later pyramids,
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:08.100]   with the pyramid texts written on the walls,
[02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:09.360]   like the Pyramid of Unas,
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:13.680]   Fifth Dynasty Pyramid at Saqqara, were tombs.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.620]   But the Great Pyramid, to go to that length
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:20.520]   to create a tomb, to make it a scale model of the earth,
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:22.700]   to orient it perfectly to true north,
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:26.120]   to make it six million tons, this is not a tomb.
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:27.040]   This is something else.
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:28.520]   This is a curiosity device.
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:31.240]   This is something that is asking us to understand it,
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.040]   and I hope we will understand it,
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.520]   and I hope Egyptologists will be willing
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.020]   to set aside that prejudice
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:39.800]   that they're only looking at a tomb
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:41.300]   and consider other possibilities.
[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.800]   And as new tech is revealing
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.160]   these previously unknown inner spaces
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:46.160]   within the Great Pyramid,
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.240]   I think that's gonna become more and more likely.
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:50.960]   - So not just the how it was built, but the why.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:52.160]   - But the why.
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:54.840]   - And to you, it seems obvious
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:57.380]   that there would be a cosmic motivation.
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:00.280]   - Yeah, very, very much so, as above, so below,
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:04.820]   which is an idea in the Hermetica.
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:07.600]   The god Hermes, for the Greeks,
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:09.720]   was the Greek version of Thoth,
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:11.200]   the wisdom god of ancient Egypt,
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:12.520]   and that's where that saying comes from.
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:14.160]   It comes from the Hermetica,
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.760]   but it's expressing an ancient Egyptian idea
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:19.600]   to mirror the perfection of the heavens on earth.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:21.080]   - So you think there's something interesting
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.400]   to be discovered about the how it was built?
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:27.720]   You mean beyond the ideas of using ramps and wet sand?
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.120]   - Yeah, ramps won't do it.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:31.600]   Ramps won't do it, nor will wet sand.
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:33.440]   It's true that the ancient Egyptians
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:38.200]   did haul big objects on sleds on wet sand.
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.400]   There are even reliefs that show the process
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:42.640]   where an individual is standing
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.880]   on the front of the sledge pouring water
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.680]   down to lubricate the sand underneath,
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.760]   and that's a perfectly respectable way
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:55.360]   to move a 200-ton block of stone across sand,
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.000]   flat sand, if you have enough people to pull it,
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.760]   but that is not gonna help you get
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.760]   dozens of 70-ton granite blocks 300 feet in the air
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:08.160]   to form the roof of the king's chamber
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.680]   and the floor of the chamber above it
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.520]   and the roof of that chamber
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.200]   and the floor of the chamber above that
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:13.760]   and so on and so forth.
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.360]   Wet sand never got those objects up there.
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.280]   Somehow they were lifted up there.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:21.480]   Now, yeah, ramps are proposed as the solution,
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:24.320]   but where are the remains of those ramps?
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:27.520]   If you're going to carry blocks weighing
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:28.840]   up to two or three tons
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.560]   right to the top of the Great Pyramid
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.400]   to complete your work,
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:33.800]   you're gonna need a ramp
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:36.000]   that's going to extend out into the desert
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.560]   for more than a mile at a 10-degree slope,
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:40.480]   and it's calculated that a 10-degree slope
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:41.800]   is about the maximum slope
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.800]   that human labor can haul objects up a ramp,
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.280]   and that ramp can't just be compacted sand,
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:52.160]   since heavy objects are being hauled up.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.360]   It's gonna have to be made of very solid material,
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:56.520]   almost as solid as the pyramid itself.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:57.360]   Where is it?
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.240]   We don't see any trace of those so-called ramps
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:01.440]   that are supposed to have been involved
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.120]   in the construction of the pyramid.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:04.240]   I think we don't know.
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:05.720]   I think we have no idea it's built.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:07.800]   That's why there's so many different theories.
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:09.440]   We haven't got the answer yet,
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:11.920]   but the how of it is one of the big mysteries
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:12.840]   from our past.
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.760]   - I love the Great Pyramids as a kind of puzzle
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:18.960]   that was created by the ancient peoples
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.040]   to be solved by later peoples.
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:22.880]   I mean, this is, I don't know if you're aware
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:25.160]   of the 10,000-year clock.
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:26.200]   - I'm not, no.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.240]   - That was built by Jeff Bezos and Danny Hillis
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:32.480]   in Sierra Diablo Mountains in Texas.
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.520]   So they're building a clock that ticks once a year
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:36.640]   for 10,000 years.
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:37.480]   - Oh, wow.
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:39.240]   - So it's talking about,
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.000]   and it's supposed to sort of run.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.960]   You know, if there's a nuclear apocalypse, it just runs.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:47.560]   And it's an example of modern humans thinking like,
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.560]   okay, if 10,000 years from now and beyond,
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.200]   if something goes wrong or the future humans
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.480]   that are way different come back
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:02.200]   and they analyze what happened here,
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:06.600]   how can we create monuments that they can then analyze?
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.280]   And in that way, be curious about, in their curiosity,
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.760]   discover some deep truths about this current time.
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:15.920]   It's an interesting kind of notion of like,
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:18.520]   what can we build now that would last?
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.040]   And the answer is that the majority
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:21.760]   of what we build now wouldn't last.
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:22.600]   - Wouldn't.
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.280]   - It would be gone within a few thousand years.
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:30.400]   But what would last is massive megalithic structures
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:33.600]   like the Great Pyramid, that would last.
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.600]   And it could be used to send a message to the future.
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:41.240]   I think Gobekli Tepe serves a similar function.
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:46.240]   I mean, there it was, it was buried 10,400 years ago.
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.000]   And then for the next 10,000 years, nobody touched it.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.360]   Nobody knew it was there.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.280]   It took the genius of Klaus Schmidt,
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:59.280]   the original excavator, to realize what he'd found
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:01.040]   and what it was.
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:03.480]   But the great thing about the sealing of Gobekli Tepe,
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:05.800]   the deliberate burial of Gobekli Tepe,
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:08.240]   is it means that no later culture trod over it
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:10.800]   and imposed their organic materials on it
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.520]   and messed up the dating sequences and so on and so forth,
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:15.800]   or vandalized it or used it as a quarry.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:17.720]   It's all there intact.
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:20.560]   - So you mentioned that the pyramids
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:23.560]   and some of the other amazing things that humans have built
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:28.600]   was the result of us humans struggling with our mortality.
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:31.680]   - That's the ultimate goal.
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:33.320]   That seems to me what's at the heart
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.000]   of many pyramids around the world,
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.320]   is that they're connected in one way or another
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:40.360]   to the notion of death
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:43.640]   and to the notion of the exploration of the afterlife.
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:45.960]   And this is, of course, the fundamental mystery
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:47.200]   that all human beings face.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:50.440]   We may wish to ignore it.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.080]   We may wish to pretend that it's not gonna happen,
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:55.960]   but we are, of course, all mortal.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.760]   Every one of us, all eight billion
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.600]   or however many of us that are on the planet right now,
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:03.520]   we're all gonna face death sooner or later.
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:06.320]   And the question is, what happens?
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.560]   And there are a few cultures
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.600]   that really intensely, deeply studied that mystery.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.840]   We are not one of them.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.440]   The general view of science, I think,
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:19.960]   is that we're accidents of evolution.
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:21.720]   When we die, the light blinks out.
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:23.880]   There's no more of us, there's no such thing as a soul,
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:25.520]   but that's not a proven point.
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.400]   There's no experiment that proves that's the case.
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.360]   We know we die, but we don't know
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:32.560]   whether there's such a thing as a soul or not.
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:33.960]   - Yeah, that's the great mystery.
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:36.040]   - It's a great mystery that we all share.
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.440]   And those cultures that have investigated it,
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:42.080]   and ancient Egypt is the best example,
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:43.760]   have investigated it thoroughly
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.560]   and map out the journey that we make after death.
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.880]   But that notion of a journey after death
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.200]   and of hazards and challenges along the way,
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.240]   and ultimately of a judgment,
[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:55.360]   that notion is found right around the world,
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:59.320]   and it even manifests into the three monotheistic face
[02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:01.240]   that are still present in the world today.
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:03.000]   - Well, you're one such human,
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.880]   and you said you contemplate your own death.
[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:08.720]   - Yeah.
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:09.560]   - Are you afraid of it?
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.280]   - No, I'm not afraid of death at all.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.240]   I'm curious about death.
[02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:16.880]   I think it could be very interesting.
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:20.000]   I think it's the beginning of the next great adventure.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.040]   So I don't fear it.
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:26.120]   And I would like to live as long as my body
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:29.520]   is healthy enough to make living worthwhile,
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:30.480]   but I don't fear death.
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:33.520]   What I do fear is pain.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:36.320]   I do fear the humiliation that old age
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:38.960]   and the collapse of the faculties can bring.
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:41.920]   I do fear the cancers that can strike us down
[02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:44.240]   and riddle us with pain and agony.
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:46.920]   That I fear very, very much indeed.
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:49.600]   But death is gonna come to all of us.
[02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:51.960]   I accept it, it's gonna come to me.
[02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:54.680]   And I'm not gonna say I'm looking forward to it,
[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.400]   but when it happens, I'm going to approach it,
[02:30:57.400 --> 02:31:01.560]   I hope, with a sense of curiosity and a sense of adventure,
[02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:04.120]   that there's something beyond this life.
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:07.880]   It isn't heaven, it isn't hell, but there's something.
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:09.240]   The soul goes on.
[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:13.240]   I think reincarnation is a very plausible idea.
[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:15.880]   Again, modern science would reject that.
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:17.880]   But there's the excellent work of Ian Stevenson,
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:20.560]   Children Who Remember Past Lives,
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:23.120]   who found that children up to the age of seven
[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:25.680]   often have memories of past lives.
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:29.840]   And in cultures where memories of past lives are discouraged,
[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:31.600]   they tend not to express that much.
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:34.400]   But in cultures where memories of past lives are encouraged,
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:36.320]   like India, they do express it.
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.960]   And he found several subjects,
[02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:40.000]   children under the age of seven in India,
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.840]   who were able to remember specific details of a past life.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:44.640]   And he was able to go to the place
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:48.840]   where that past life unfolded and validate those details.
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:51.880]   So if consciousness is the basis of everything,
[02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:53.360]   if it's the essence of everything,
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.640]   and consciousness benefits in some way
[02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:58.240]   from being incarnated in physical form,
[02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:00.120]   then reincarnation makes a lot of sense.
[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:01.840]   All the investment that the universe has put
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:05.000]   into creating this home for life
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.760]   may have a much bigger purpose than just accident.
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:12.240]   - What a beautiful mystery this whole thing is.
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:13.600]   - Yeah, we are immersed in mystery.
[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:14.960]   We live in the midst of mystery.
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:16.120]   We're surrounded by mystery.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:19.800]   And if we pretend otherwise, we're deluding ourselves.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.360]   - And Graham, thank you so much for inspiring the world
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:23.720]   to explore that mystery.
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:24.920]   Thank you for talking today.
[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:25.760]   - Thank you, Lex.
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:27.440]   It's been a pleasure.
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:29.000]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.400]   with Graham Hancock.
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:31.640]   To support this podcast,
[02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:34.640]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:36.560]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:38.400]   from Charles Darwin.
[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:41.880]   It is not the strongest of the species that survives,
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:44.480]   nor the most intelligent.
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:48.320]   It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:52.720]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:55.320]   (upbeat music)
[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:57.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:07.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
