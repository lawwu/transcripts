[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.180]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,

[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.420]   is for you.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.580]   So without further ado,
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.180]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.440]   The first question is about the pros and cons
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.740]   of daily caffeine consumption.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.780]   The question reads,
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.820]   what is your opinion on the net benefit
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.380]   of daily caffeine consumption?
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.760]   And how can somebody determine
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.700]   if daily caffeine consumption is right for them?
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.820]   Well, first of all, I did an entire episode about caffeine.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.000]   You can find that by going to Hubermanlab.com.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.840]   At that website,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.140]   you can put in caffeine into the search function
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.720]   and you'll find links to that episode in all the formats,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.660]   YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.960]   And it's timestamped, of course,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.900]   you can navigate to the particular topics
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.620]   most of interest to you.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620]   However, for sake of this discussion,
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.880]   I can summarize a few of the key points.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.180]   The most important thing to understand
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.020]   is that for most adults,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.600]   so that is people about age 18 to 20 or older,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.840]   daily caffeine consumption is not going to be a problem
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.440]   provided it does not induce anxiety
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.000]   and certainly provided that not induce anxiety
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.860]   or panic attacks,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.120]   and provided that it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.780]   This is why I always recommend
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.860]   that if you are going to consume caffeine in any form,
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.360]   coffee, tea, soda, or otherwise,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.940]   that you try not to ingest caffeine within the eight
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.280]   and ideally within the 10 or even 12 hours prior to bedtime.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.640]   That's because the half-life of caffeine is such
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060]   that even if you are able to, for instance,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.900]   have a cup of coffee around 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.780]   and then fall asleep around midnight,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.380]   the architecture of the sleep that you get
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.980]   is going to be disrupted.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.260]   For instance,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.420]   it is very important that you get sufficient amounts
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.180]   of both slow wave deep sleep
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.060]   as well as rapid eye movement sleep each night,
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.940]   and if you consume caffeine too close to bedtime,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.380]   and here I'm defining too close
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.960]   as anywhere from eight to 12 hours before going to sleep,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.380]   chances are you're not going to get
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.320]   as much rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.060]   that you would otherwise,
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.140]   and it is the amount of rapid eye movement sleep
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.780]   and slow wave sleep that together lead
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.980]   to whether or not you feel you had a good night's sleep
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.040]   in terms of your next day alertness and cognitive abilities.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.500]   Now, again, some people may find
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.300]   that they can drink caffeine in the late afternoon,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.340]   maybe even at night and still fall asleep,
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.960]   but I promise you, even if you're in that category,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.100]   you will sleep far better,
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.380]   meaning the architecture of your sleep will be better
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.180]   and you will feel far more rested the next day
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.580]   if you abstain from caffeine
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.540]   within the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime,
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.220]   and I should also say that none of us are perfect,
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.380]   myself included.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.600]   I will sometimes have a cup of coffee in the late afternoon,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.940]   and sometimes that will cause me
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.940]   to stay up a little bit later.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.240]   Sometimes it won't.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.620]   I don't think you want to obsess or worry too much
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.080]   about having some caffeine every once in a while
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.820]   in the late afternoon if you are still able to fall asleep,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.720]   but don't make it a regular habit.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.880]   Now, as far as we know,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.300]   there is no drawback to consuming caffeine on a daily basis,
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.260]   again, provided it does not disrupt your nighttime sleep
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.280]   and provided that does not induce anxiety.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.060]   In fact, most of the world consumes caffeine
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.260]   every single day.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.000]   The current estimates are that 90%,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.880]   that's right, nine zero, 90% of adults throughout the world
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.000]   consume a caffeinated beverage every single day.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.480]   That's a staggeringly high number,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.260]   making caffeine the most popular drug on the planet.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.380]   In fact, because of the way that caffeine works,
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.740]   and just to remind you how it works,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.800]   it effectively blocks adenosine receptors.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.740]   Adenosine is a molecule that builds up
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.020]   in your brain and body more and more.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540]   According to how long you've been awake,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.800]   it makes you feel sleepy.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.820]   Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor,
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.980]   and then when it is dislodged from that receptor,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.100]   whatever adenosine has built up and is around
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.460]   can then bind to the adenosine receptor
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.860]   and makes you feel very sleepy.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.500]   That's the caffeine crash.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.380]   So if 90% of the adult population of the planet Earth
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.820]   is consuming caffeine every day,
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.500]   that means 90% of the adult population of planet Earth
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.900]   is blocking their adenosine receptors
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.500]   for some portion of their daily life,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.740]   and then their adenosine is binding to the vacant receptor
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.140]   once the caffeine has dislodged.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.140]   And why are 90% of adult humans consuming caffeine every day?
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.100]   Well, to feel more energized, more focused,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.100]   to have more both cognitive energy and physical energy.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.820]   Now, of course, most people are not walking around thinking,
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.160]   oh, caffeine gives me more energy, more focus, et cetera.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.700]   Most people are consuming caffeine every single day
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.700]   and are consuming caffeine every single day
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.420]   in order to feel quote unquote normal
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.880]   to be at their baseline level of cognitive ability
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.260]   and physical energy and so on.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.340]   In fact, if you look at the data on caffeine consumption,
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   what you'll find is that caffeine
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.140]   actually is a cognitive enhancer.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.740]   It can improve learning and memory,
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.320]   it can increase physical energy,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.300]   it can increase mental and physical stamina.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.300]   But a feature of those studies that's not often discussed,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.160]   but that was however discussed
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.260]   in the full episode on caffeine,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.880]   is that studies of caffeine typically are done
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.220]   by taking chronic caffeine users
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.020]   and then having them abstain from caffeine
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.060]   for some period of time,
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.020]   usually four days to two weeks,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.360]   in which time they undergo caffeine withdrawal.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.400]   They do not feel well, they get foggy headed,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.680]   they have less energy, there's some malaise,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.640]   sometimes even some mild depression.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.680]   And then what they do is they have people take caffeine
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.660]   and take a cognitive exam or do some physical activity
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.520]   and compare their performance to what it was
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.860]   when they were in the withdrawal state.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.420]   Another typical form of study on caffeine
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.580]   is to take people who are naive to caffeine
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.380]   or who never take caffeine and then have them ingest caffeine
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.120]   and then measure their cognitive and or physical performance.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.080]   And in both cases, you see improvements.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.340]   What I'm saying here is that daily caffeine consumption
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   is not going to lead to improvements in cognitive ability
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.580]   or improvements in physical ability above one's baseline
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.220]   unless you either abstain from caffeine
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.240]   for some period of time, typically four days
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.260]   to two weeks prior, or you are not somebody
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.420]   who typically ingests caffeine.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.980]   In other words, 90% of the world's population
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.180]   is drinking caffeine on a daily basis
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.380]   to be at their normal level
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.380]   of mental and physical functioning.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.900]   So the question was, is there a net benefit
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.700]   to daily caffeine consumption?
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.920]   And here I can reliably say,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.960]   provided you don't suffer from anxiety attacks
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.920]   or lack of sleep from the caffeine consumption,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.540]   provided that you're mindful of not ingesting caffeine
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.780]   too late in the day, there doesn't seem to be
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.860]   any big drawback to drinking caffeine on a daily basis.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.740]   However, there doesn't seem to be any great benefit,
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.080]   at least in terms of direct effects
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.680]   on cognitive or physical ability, okay?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.860]   So I realize this is a little bit of a convoluted answer,
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.140]   but we have to be honest with one another here.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.820]   Caffeine is a performance enhancing drug,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.740]   but only when compared to the non-caffeinated state
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.920]   and 90% of the adult population in the world is caffeinated.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.180]   So adding more caffeine above what you would normally consume
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.540]   is certainly not going to allow you to think better
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.940]   and perform better physically.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.240]   Here's a useful way to think about caffeine.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.340]   Most people can pretty well tolerate doses of caffeine
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.740]   anywhere from 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.520]   Depends on body weight and depends on your tolerance.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.640]   Tolerance, of course, based on how familiar you are
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.060]   with the effects of caffeine
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.980]   and how regularly you consume it.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.540]   A typical cup of coffee, which by the way, does not exist,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.560]   depending on the vendor,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.380]   depending on how much water to coffee ratio one uses,
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.900]   depending on whether or not it's French press
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.700]   or it's pour over, the type of coffee, et cetera,
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.660]   all of that is going to determine
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.320]   the total amount of caffeine in that coffee.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.720]   But we can set some outer bounds
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.480]   on the total amount of caffeine
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.980]   that likely exists in a cup of coffee.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.660]   And it's probably somewhere between 100 milligrams,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.540]   that would be on the weaker side
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.340]   for a six or eight ounce cup of coffee,
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.300]   out to about 300 milligrams
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.780]   for the equivalent six to eight ounces of coffee.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.420]   But if you were to brew your coffee very, very strong,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.760]   or like me occasionally throw a shot of espresso in there too,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.600]   you could get that number
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.980]   up to 400 or 500 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.800]   I personally tolerate caffeine pretty well.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.660]   I've been drinking caffeine since I was a teenager,
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.660]   mostly in the form of brewed, unflavored yerba mate tea.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.500]   It's important to stay away
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.220]   from the smoked varieties of yerba mate.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.940]   If you're going to get your caffeine from yerba mate,
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.820]   the smoked varieties can be carcinogenic.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.200]   The non-smoked varieties don't seem to have that property.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.540]   But there's a lot of caffeine in yerba mate.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.060]   So I'll drink yerba mate and have for many, many years,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.380]   or I'll drink black coffee or espresso
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.300]   or espresso Americano, things of that sort.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.420]   That's my preferred source of caffeine.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.860]   Most people are drinking coffee to get their caffeine.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.620]   And I would say that if you are going to drink your caffeine,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.380]   drink it in the early part of the day,
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.380]   as I mentioned earlier,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.700]   I am a big proponent of delaying your first caffeine intake
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.560]   until at least 90 minutes after waking
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.360]   in order to avoid the afternoon crash.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.000]   I've talked a lot about this on the podcast.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.260]   There are a lot of clips on the internet
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.160]   explaining the rationale behind that.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.100]   And if you do experience an afternoon crash in energy,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.520]   I do recommend delaying your morning caffeine intake
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.400]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.240]   Now, for people that want to get more
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.600]   of a true cognitive enhancing
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   and performance enhancing effect from caffeine,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.180]   again, you're going to have to abstain from caffeine
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.700]   for about four days.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.060]   For regular caffeine drinkers,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.120]   that's going to be difficult, right?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.260]   That is going to lead to headaches.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.680]   That's going to lead to brain fog.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.220]   That's going to lead to feelings of malaise.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.780]   In fact, the last time I took four days off
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.280]   or even a week off from caffeine consumption
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.620]   was when I was sick.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.760]   I don't get sick very often,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.240]   but when I am sick, I generally abstain from caffeine.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.420]   And sometimes I wonder whether or not the malaise I feel
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.760]   from whatever viral or bacterial thing
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   I might be dealing with when I'm sick
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.900]   is in part the malaise of caffeine withdrawal.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.360]   I certainly noticed I feel much better
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.820]   when I returned to drinking caffeine,
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.360]   but that tends to coincide with feeling relief
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.680]   from whatever sinus symptoms
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.400]   and other symptoms I might have been experiencing
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.240]   from the illness.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.440]   So it's not a good experiment.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.300]   I can't tease apart those variables.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.920]   So the short answer is for most adults,
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.000]   there does not seem to be any major downside
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   to consuming caffeine.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.760]   And there have been scattered reports here and there
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.880]   in humans showing that ingesting caffeine
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.380]   can increase dopamine receptors,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.000]   which will effectively allow you to get more out
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.840]   of the dopamine that you produce.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.500]   This is why caffeine has a mood elevating
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.580]   as well as energy elevating effect.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.900]   I should point out that some people
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.360]   just cannot tolerate caffeine.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.880]   It makes them too jittery, too anxious.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.520]   They start sweating, they get heart palpitations.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.660]   It's very hard for these people to build up a tolerance
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.300]   to caffeine that allows them to enjoy it.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.760]   These are the people that can even feel
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.840]   a fluttering of the heart and a lot of energy left
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.920]   from decaf coffee.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.500]   Something that to me is just a foreign concept,
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.040]   but some people are just that sensitive to caffeine
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.240]   that even the small amounts of caffeine and chocolate
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.060]   or decaf coffee make them feel too alert.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.720]   And they should abstain from caffeine.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.620]   I don't think they are in any way harming their health
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.200]   by abstaining from caffeine.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.900]   Then there's the issue of children and adolescents
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.480]   and teenagers and young adults ingesting caffeine.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.600]   And I covered some of this in the episode about caffeine,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.200]   but there's been a lot of debate as to whether or not
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.100]   caffeine can cause osteoporosis,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.840]   whether or not it can leach calcium out of the bones,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.960]   whether or not it can stunt growth.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   Frankly, there's not a lot of evidence
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.040]   for those sorts of claims.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.500]   And yet the developing brain is a very tender
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.340]   and malleable environment.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.620]   And as somebody who started off his career
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.060]   as a developmental neurobiologist
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.900]   studying developmental brain plasticity and wiring,
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.860]   it does sort of make me cringe to think about children
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.380]   younger than the age of say 14,
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.020]   ingesting large amounts of caffeine in any form,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.940]   soda, coffee, tea, et cetera,
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.880]   despite the fact that there's very little evidence
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.780]   that it can stunt their growth.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.640]   I don't personally like the idea of the young brain
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.900]   being bathed in an adenosine receptor antagonist,
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.580]   which is effectively what caffeine is.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.140]   As much as possible, one wants the developing brain
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.260]   to develop in a milieu of unencumbered,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.060]   non-chemically encumbered interactions
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.080]   between neurotransmitters and their receptors,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.500]   unless of course there's a clinical need
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.020]   for a prescription drug or a supplement
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.600]   or some modification of a nutritional program
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.220]   specifically to up or down regulate the dopamine system
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.040]   or up or down regulate the serotonin system.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.340]   But those are the sorts of decisions
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.540]   that really should be made in close oversight
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.540]   and recommendations by a psychiatrist.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.620]   So the short answer around daily caffeine consumption
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.820]   in young people, meaning 14 and younger,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.000]   is avoid it if you can.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.060]   Have your children avoid caffeine if they can.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.900]   The occasional bit of caffeine
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.800]   is probably not going to be a problem.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.400]   The amount of caffeine in small amounts of chocolate,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.100]   probably not going to be a problem.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.420]   But caffeine in the form of energy drinks,
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.760]   sodas, coffee, tea for children younger than 14
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.140]   just seems like a bad idea
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.540]   from everything we understand about brain wiring
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.060]   and the trajectories of brains
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.400]   that develop with a lot of chemical adjustment
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.500]   from other sources like caffeine.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.660]   Now for kids age 15 to say 18 or 20,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   a lot of brain wiring is still occurring,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.540]   but a lot of it has been completed.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.620]   So probably not as risky to consume caffeine
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.860]   every once in a while, or maybe even on a daily basis.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.580]   But there are two, I think there are great advantages
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.460]   to limiting the amount of caffeine that one ingests.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.500]   And of course, in the adolescent and teen years,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.540]   nowadays a lot of kids are consuming energy drinks and soda.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.260]   And some of those energy drinks and sodas
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.500]   contain a lot of caffeine,
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.540]   anywhere from 200 to 800 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.900]   And nowadays more sodas and energy drinks
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.520]   contain other things like amino acid precursors
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.020]   to neuromodulators like dopamine.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.380]   So for instance, a lot of energy drinks now
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.760]   contain L-tyrosine, which is a precursor to dopamine.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.020]   A lot of them will contain theanine.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.980]   I've talked about theanine as a supplement
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.060]   that can promote more restful sleep
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.380]   if taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.820]   The reason why a lot of energy drinks and sodas,
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.820]   and frankly now coffee brands are including theanine
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.420]   in the coffee or energy drink or soda
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   is because it tends to have a mild anxiety reducing effect
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.420]   and it reduces the jitters that caffeine creates.
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.900]   And so that's actually a trick that these companies
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.880]   are using in order to get people to ingest more caffeine
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.520]   because by including the theanine,
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.880]   it's preventing the kid or adult from feeling too jittery
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.500]   and therefore they can continue to consume that drink
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.780]   without feeling like they're overstimulated.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   So if I were to take the parental neuroscientist,
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.940]   adult voice here, I would say avoid caffeine intake
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.720]   as much as you can until you're about 18 years old.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.000]   But I'm realistic, I realized that adolescents and teens
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.860]   age say 14 or 15 out to 18 and older
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.280]   are going to be consuming caffeine
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.300]   in the form of energy drinks and sodas,
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.880]   but reducing the total amount of caffeine
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.640]   that one is ingesting in those years,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.120]   it just seems really advantageous.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.380]   Again, for all the same reasons I mentioned earlier,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.060]   you don't want the young brain bathing
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.680]   in a bunch of exogenous,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.540]   meaning externally introduced neurochemicals
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.460]   or in things like theanine or L-tyrosine.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.740]   If you're going to indulge in caffeine or in energy drinks
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.860]   or theanine or L-tyrosine for that matter,
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.240]   that's the sort of thing that probably is best left
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.880]   for people 18 and older.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.380]   And even there, if one finds that caffeine is for them,
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.300]   as do I, I think always best to try and get your caffeine
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.820]   from a clean source, a clean source,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.680]   meaning something that contains just coffee or just tea.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.500]   Again, this isn't a knock on energy drink specifically,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.100]   but you really have to make sure
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.520]   that whatever energy drink you're going to consume,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.860]   you know what's in it,
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.700]   you recognize what the different ingredients do,
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.420]   and you recognize the potential of ingesting
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.600]   those ingredients chronically over and over again.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.020]   And I've talked a little bit about this
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.940]   on previous podcasts, and I'll get into this.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.060]   Again, maybe we'll do an entire episode about energy drinks
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.260]   because they are so commonly consumed nowadays.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.780]   Now, getting back to the original question
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.580]   about daily caffeine consumption,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.900]   this person goes on to say that for them, okay,
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.340]   this is their personal experience,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.820]   after a few weeks of consumption of daily caffeine,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.780]   the negatives start to outweigh the positive ones.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.860]   They're getting poor quality sleep, lack of appetite,
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.140]   anxiety, et cetera.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.900]   And when they don't consume caffeine,
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.660]   they find it a lot easier to be mindful
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.540]   and their meditation practice is much better,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.460]   but they're lethargic and less motivated.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.500]   Okay, so what they're describing
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.420]   are all the classic symptoms of caffeine overuse,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.020]   probably not abuse in this case,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.120]   although caffeine can be truly abused,
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.580]   people taking caffeine pills, et cetera,
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.340]   in large quantities.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.220]   We're not talking about that,
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.980]   but this person is describing the classic pattern
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.740]   of overuse of caffeine
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.420]   and the classic pattern of withdrawal from caffeine
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.380]   when they stop taking it.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.080]   So what should somebody like this do?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.720]   And I think that's an important question to answer
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.500]   because I think a lot of people fall into this category.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.300]   They drink caffeine every day.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.240]   They're no longer getting
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.300]   the performance enhancing effect of caffeine,
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.980]   so they're taking it just to be normal
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.820]   or feel like they can focus normally
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.440]   and have normal amounts of energy.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.660]   But then if they try and come off, they feel worse.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.900]   Okay, there are a couple of ways to do this.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.740]   You can taper your caffeine intake off
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.180]   over the course of four to seven days,
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.600]   but most people don't have the discipline
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.460]   or don't want to spend the time doing that.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.280]   But if you want to, the way you would do that
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.780]   is you would cut it by about 10 or 15% per day.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.860]   You could do that by volume
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.140]   or you could do that by concentration of coffee,
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.980]   that sort of thing.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.960]   A simpler way to go about all this
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.300]   that still will allow you to get
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.580]   some of the performance enhancing effects of caffeine
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.800]   and yet experience far less withdrawal would be two things.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.100]   First of all, just halve your amount of caffeine intake
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.900]   for two or three days.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.260]   So again, that could be by volume
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.420]   or it could be by concentration,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.100]   probably easiest to do by volume.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.080]   And so instead of drinking an eight ounce coffee
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.760]   in the morning, maybe you do four ounces of regular coffee,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.820]   four ounces of decaf,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.460]   or you just have the four ounces of coffee.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.620]   You do that for three or four days
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.100]   and then you take perhaps one full day off from caffeine,
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.020]   maybe another full day off.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.900]   You're going to feel a lot less bad on those two days,
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.740]   having cut your caffeine intake in half
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.660]   in the previous four days
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.000]   than you would if you just went cold turkey.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.740]   And then you go back to ingesting caffeine,
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.580]   but you go back to ingesting caffeine at that 50% dose
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.780]   or what used to represent that 50% dose of caffeine for you.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.100]   And you just continue that way on a daily basis.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.060]   And then every once in a while,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.020]   when you want the performance enhancing effects of caffeine,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.940]   you go back to what was your original dose,
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.700]   which is now double what you're taking on a daily basis.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.860]   So what we're really talking about here
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.980]   is not going cold turkey.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.220]   We're not talking about quitting caffeine indefinitely.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.140]   What we're talking about is cutting the amount of caffeine
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.840]   that you drink in half for about four days, okay?
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.500]   Plus or minus a day.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.620]   And then taking two days off from caffeine completely
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.020]   and then going back on that half dose of caffeine
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.300]   indefinitely, that's your new baseline of caffeine intake.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.580]   And then every once in a while,
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.080]   if you need a bit more of a lift,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.620]   you ingest twice as much caffeine
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.020]   or a coffee that's twice as concentrated.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.260]   We should acknowledge that most people
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.300]   aren't going to be really precise
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.260]   about the amount of ounces and the amount of caffeine.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.860]   Nonetheless, it's pretty straightforward
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   to know that you're reducing your caffeine intake.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.900]   Certainly it's clear to know
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.580]   if you're ingesting no caffeine for a couple of days.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.060]   And it's pretty clear
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.540]   when you're doubling the amount of caffeine,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.520]   but you don't have to worry so much
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.820]   that you're exactly doubling the amount of caffeine.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.160]   You could drink one and a half times
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.340]   as much as you happen to drink on the day before,
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.780]   or you could drink three times as much.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.800]   You would definitely feel it
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.540]   if you drink three times as much.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.100]   One very important thing to recognize
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.380]   is that on any day where you really spike
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.900]   your caffeine intake above baseline,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.620]   no matter where that baseline is when you start,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.900]   could be zero, could be 400 milligrams,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.300]   could be 200 milligrams.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.440]   When you double that intake,
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.140]   you will get a big boost of energy.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.420]   And the next day,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.320]   you're going to feel the crash from that.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.720]   You're going to feel more lethargic.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.740]   You're going to feel not so good.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.980]   This has to do with dopamine receptor modulation.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.620]   This has to do with adenosine receptor modulation.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.480]   The important thing to do is not continue
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.220]   to consume that elevated level of caffeine,
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.500]   which is what most people do.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.060]   And then they set a new higher baseline
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.900]   just to feel normal.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.640]   The key thing is to just manage
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.500]   to get through that crash day,
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.860]   manage to get through that one day
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.240]   where you feel a little less good,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.560]   or maybe even down a bit,
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.140]   get outside a bit, get some more sunshine.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.620]   We know that spikes your cortisol in a good way, right?
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.020]   It can increase the catecholamines, dopamine, et cetera.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.180]   Get a little bit more sunlight,
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.080]   get a little bit more movement, get outside,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.980]   do something to offset those feelings of malaise,
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.520]   and then get right back to your original goal
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.180]   level of caffeine each day.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.460]   There's no use in getting so quantitative
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.100]   that you make your life miserable,
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.520]   measuring things out like a laboratory chemist.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.700]   If you're that type and you want to do that, be my guest.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.540]   But unless you're taking caffeine in pill form,
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.300]   it's very, very hard to get extremely exact
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.620]   about the amounts of caffeine that you're ingesting.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.940]   So it is okay to eyeball it,
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.720]   but understand the contour of how caffeine works
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.980]   and what the caffeine performance enhancing effect
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.820]   comes from.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.000]   It comes from a caffeine intake above baseline.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.940]   Understand that anytime you go above baseline
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.140]   with your caffeine intake,
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.740]   there's the potential of some anxiety.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.620]   Understand that there's going to be a slight withdrawal
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.060]   effect that lasts about 24 to 48 hours,
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.860]   battle through that short period,
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.020]   and you'll be right back where you started
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.380]   and where you need to be so that you can enjoy caffeine
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.200]   on a daily basis and derive the benefits,
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.140]   because there are many benefits to drinking caffeine
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.380]   and avoiding some of the potential hazards.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.200]   And again, if you're a young person,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.560]   I recommend delaying that caffeine intake
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.620]   maybe, I don't know, 10 years.
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.180]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.140]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.500]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.100]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.380]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.580]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.180]   standard channel and premium tools
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.620]   not released anywhere else,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.740]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.940]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.140]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.020]   it's really twofold.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.940]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.420]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.480]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.140]   every Monday in full length.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.540]   We are not going to change the format
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.140]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.580]   and to fund research,
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.620]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.660]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.480]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.660]   that we are most interested in.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.680]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.300]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.260]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.660]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.340]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.660]   and other media channels.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.240]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.440]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.620]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.360]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   in the first place.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.700]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.660]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.040]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.940]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.540]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.520]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.580]   to further support research for science
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.340]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.880]   physical health, and performance.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.720]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.480]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.540]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.300]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.660]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.540]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.140]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.500]   that other people ask as well.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.460]   There will also be some premium content
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.260]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.820]   and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.380]   podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.700]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.060]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.480]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.140]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.040]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.860]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.440]   [upbeat music]
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.020]   (upbeat music)
