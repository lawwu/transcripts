[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   In the new book, "Slow Productivity," coming out in March, I talk about my growing interest in
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.840]   movies and how for anyone who does creative work, studying and building up a good appreciation for
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   an unrelated creative field actually can really help what you're doing. And I write about in "Slow
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.680]   Productivity" about studying films as helping my writing. If I study good writers, it's too close
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.240]   to home. And it's kind of more of a stressful work and like, it's not inspiring. It's more,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.680]   "I should do more of that," or it's more anxiety producing. But you study art in another format,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   you can come at that as like, "I don't do that art." So you can just appreciate it with open
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.760]   eyes and it gives you an injection of creative energy for what you're doing. So I'm a big,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.840]   I talk about this a lot, not a lot, but I do talk about in "Slow Productivity,"
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.280]   studying an art that's not what you do will make you more inspired for what you do actually do.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.480]   - All right. Speaking of which, we got questions.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.640]   - All right. First question's from Mark. "What is note-taking for? I found note-taking most useful
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.000]   in the short term, grounding me in my current task or noting a few to-do's throughout the day.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.840]   Almost all of them are immediately disposable. It seems like note-taking can become fairly
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.120]   navel-gazing and doing it excessively takes away from execution."
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.240]   - It's a good question because we see this a lot in our discussions of organization,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.160]   "notes" and "note-taking" is an excessively broad term. It covers lots of different things. And for
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.440]   a lot of people like Mark, these things get all mixed up and they're thinking, "Well, I don't
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.200]   know. I'm sitting here journaling all day. Is this note-taking? What should I be doing? What
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   should I not be doing?" So what I want to do here is step back and let's give a general definition
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.360]   for note-taking. And then I want to highlight what I think the three critical types of note-taking
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.200]   systems you need in your life if you work any sort of knowledge job. And then we can, from there,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   move on to talk about more advanced options. So let's define note-taking more generally to mean
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.200]   recording information on a durable written medium. So anywhere you're collecting information in a
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   written medium that's durable, that will then, you have it outside of your head so you can
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.160]   reference it later. Here are the three types of this note-taking that I think are critical,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.600]   especially for most knowledge workers. One, some sort of working memory extender.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.520]   This is where I use my text file on my desktop of my computer's workingmemory.txt. This is for
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.880]   strictly expanding the amount of information you can temporarily hold on to as you engage with the
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.000]   inflow of information throughout your workday. So as things come in, you're in a meeting and people
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.680]   are suggesting next steps, you can just write this information down in whatever medium you use for
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.560]   your working memory extender, because it's probably more information you can keep in your head. So
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.680]   there it is. I write it down right there. Or I'm going through my email inbox and I need to
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.160]   remember different notes I need to act on, schedule this, get back to them. I can write it into my
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200]   workingmemory.extender. These are notes that exist outside of your own brain, allows you to hold on
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.080]   and organize more information than you could do just strictly within the confines of your own
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.880]   neurons. Now, this is something that resets all the time. It's a durable form, but you reset it
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.280]   all the time. So as I'm going through a meeting, I'm taking quick notes on here's the five things
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   I need to do. After that meeting, those notes will then get processed out of my working memory file
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.600]   into calendar reminders into my obligation system. So it's a temporary storage, but it allows me in
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.120]   the moment to keep track of more things that my brain can do on its own. That's note-taking,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.360]   but of a very temporary type. Next comes what I just cited, which is your obligation tracker,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.560]   some system to maintain all of the relevant information for every obligation on your plate.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.040]   This is also note-taking, written durable information that you don't have to keep track of
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.240]   in your head. So somewhere here, all the things I have to do probably categorized.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.120]   Here is all of the information related to each of these things all in this one place.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   You want that information accessible and captured somewhere. That's note-taking.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.320]   Then finally, we get to what most people think of when they think about note-taking,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   and this is more where you're capturing key ideas about your work in your life.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.800]   It could be interesting ideas, interesting articles, brainstorms, concerns that you have.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   This is the broad category that captures what people normally think about in note-taking.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.080]   I might be journaling my thoughts about things. I might be writing down my plans for how I want
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.520]   to improve my life. I might be capturing articles that are relevant to the newsletter that I run
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.760]   and things I want to remember. And this is where you're going to use whatever type of system you
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   like to capture things in. You have a lot of different choices here.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.280]   All three of these things are note-taking. You need some sort of system for each.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.560]   So in my own life, I use a plain text file for working memory. I use Trello for obligation
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.720]   tracking notes, one board per role, one column per type of obligation, one card per obligation,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.240]   all of the relevant information for that obligation on the card.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.720]   And I use my Remarkable 2 digital notebook for everything else. Inside my Remarkable 2,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.880]   I have dozens of different individual virtual notebooks for keeping track of
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.960]   ideas, reflections, concerns, et cetera. So those are the three categories, Mark.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.440]   Do those three categories, different tools for each, different rates of refresh and reset for
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.840]   each working memory. You're resetting this every 10 minutes or so. Your obligation list you're
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.560]   working with every day. Your bigger idea capture is something you maybe go over
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.040]   in detail much less often. Hey, I'm going to have a summit now to rethink this part of my business.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.080]   Let me go back and look through my notes. Maybe that's just once every few months or so.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:08.880]   So that's really it. There are more complicated systems and methodologies. We have a lot of fans
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.920]   here of Zettelkasten type systems. We also have a lot of fans here of interesting note-taking
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   software that really gets into the details of how you store notes, how you connect notes,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.520]   the format in which the notes are stored. That is optional. It's more about your interest.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.600]   If you like information management as a hobby, you can build more complicated systems around it,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   but you don't need complicated systems to successfully take notes. Those are the three
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.360]   areas you have to take notes. Just make sure those are all three covered with some sort of
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.760]   reasonable techno system, and then you're doing a fine job. I think that separation is key. Don't
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.960]   mix all this stuff together. Don't have a moleskin somewhere in which you're trying to keep your tasks
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.000]   next to your vision for living on a cabin in 20 years, next to a grocery list you want to remember
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.480]   when you go to the store. We need some separation for note-taking to keep up with the complexity of
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:14.640]   modern life. All right. What do we got next, Jesse? Next question is from Reshab. As a 26-year-old
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.840]   software developer who has recently landed a well-paying job, I'm looking to pursue my interest
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.280]   in learning to play the guitar, drawing, and some days gardening. However, I'm concerned about
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.960]   whether it's feasible to schedule all these activities into a single week while maintaining
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   a focus on deep life core fundamentals. In your expert opinion, would it be possible to balance
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.320]   all these pursuits effectively within a given week without compromising on essential life habits?
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.160]   Well, I think this is a objective question for which you can get an objective answer
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.040]   by becoming quantitative. So let's just work with your calendar. I'm assuming you're
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.080]   professionally speaking, you're organized, you time block your days, you have a clear shutdown.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.840]   There's some clarity about your time outside of work. Play with that time. So start autopilot
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   scheduling some of these hobbies. Maybe you garden on weekday mornings. Maybe you alternate
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.160]   a guitar practice session and what was the other thing? Drawing practice session on different days.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:26.400]   You do it an hour before dinner. Autopilot this out. See if it fits. And if the stuff does fit,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.000]   execute this autopilot schedule for a while and say, does this feel sustainable or do I feel like
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.680]   I'm constantly running from one thing to another or it's overfilling my time?
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.360]   I used to run this exercise with undergraduates who are trying to figure out
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.520]   their academic programs and their extracurricular programs. And I would say, we got to sit down and
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.720]   just build a plan for your proposal here. You want to do these five extracurriculars in double major,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.440]   show me the time. Then they would go through and block off the time for studying and how long is
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   this going to take and put on their meetings and the time to work on their activities. And it either
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.680]   fit or it didn't. And sometimes if it just barely fit, they would come back a week later and say,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.520]   this is crazy. Every minute of my life is scheduled. So if it doesn't fit or it fits
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.120]   and your life feels too crowded, then you just pull back. You're getting an objective feedback
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.720]   here. You pull back and it doesn't matter if you're pulling back. These are hobbies. The thing
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.280]   is you want to be spending quality time outside of work on things that matter. The quantity isn't
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   important. So if it doesn't fit or it barely fits, maybe you do seasonal pursuits. In the spring,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   I'm working a lot on my garden and in the winter, I'm spending a lot more time on guitar because
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.360]   that's sort of inside. And I do drawing in the fall. You could have seasonal pursuits. You could
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   stack these one over another. Or maybe what you need to do is just slow down your ambition for
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.640]   these pursuits. And instead of saying, look, I'm going to do four hours of guitar a day and I want
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.160]   to be shredding in like six months, you say, I'm going to spend less time. Good, hard practice,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.400]   like we talked about the deep dive, trying to move up the stair steps towards expert knowledge.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   But I'm just willing for this to take longer. A few years from now, I'll be a pretty good guitar
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.360]   player, but I'm playing just an hour every other day. That doesn't take up as much time. I'm doing
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.920]   so. I have a drawing class I take once a week. And on Fridays, I get out of work early and go
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.200]   to a park to work on the drawing. This is maybe I'm going to learn these skills slower, but that
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.760]   makes their footprint on my schedule smaller. And I have more give and more flexibility and
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.120]   don't feel like I'm overscheduled. So treat this like a quantitative question, get clear feedback.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   If it's too much, reduce or slow down. It doesn't really matter for your goal here,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.360]   which is just to make sure that you're engaged in deeper pursuits. That's what matters. Not the
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.800]   speed at which you're getting better at things, not the quantity of things that you're actually
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   going after. All right, who do we got next? Next question is from Craig. I'm a college student
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.360]   trying to be more smart about how I study and organize my learning. I'm relatively new to this
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.640]   stuff. Strangely, most productivity tips on YouTube are about the top 10 to-do lists and
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   note-taking apps. Will I be less effective if I don't use one of those apps? It seems like a lot
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   of work and setup to learn all those apps to be efficient. And I dread thinking about the heavy
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:18.000]   lifting prep those apps require. What should I do? Well, I think my answer here at first is going to
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.640]   be ironic because you may be listening to this answer on YouTube, but I'm going to tell you in
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.400]   a second why what I'm about to say here is not oxymoronic. Don't use YouTube to get advice on
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.840]   studying. So when you're getting information, especially information on improving your life,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:44.320]   you have to understand the incentive structures in place. And for people who are purely doing
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:52.000]   YouTube, so if you're a pure study habits YouTuber, the incentive structure is for views.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.760]   That's what you look about. That's what we care about. I want more views on my videos.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:04.080]   To get more views on your videos on YouTube, you have to work with the idiosyncratic properties
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.320]   of the recommendation algorithm. And you get into this feedback loop where your content
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.720]   morphs more and more towards what's giving you this better feedback from the algorithm.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.880]   And after a while, it's the algorithm specifying your content. So you may be started out as a
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.360]   YouTuber saying, I want to help students study better because this is an audience
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.960]   out there that cares about this. And after six months of interacting with the algorithm,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.120]   it's the top 10 to-do list apps or whatever, because this is what's getting them the best
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.720]   view numbers. The advice might have very little to do, however, with the nuts and bolts of becoming
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.960]   a better student. So the incentive structure matters. So if you want to become a better
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.520]   student, and this is going to sound very self-serving, but I'm going to say,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.280]   read my book, how to become a straight A student. Now, why is that better? Because what is the
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.920]   incentive structure of books? When you write a book, like how to become a straight A student,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.680]   let me tell you this from experience. This is not a, we're going to go hard out of the gate.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.440]   There's going to be a number one New York times bestseller. I'm going to be on the today show
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.480]   talking about this book and every major podcaster wants to have me on. That is not the play. When
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:22.080]   you write a book on student advice, the play is this better work. So some people will buy this
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.120]   because they heard about it from me or saw it on a table. I'm embarrassed to admit this Jesse,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.880]   but when that book came out, it was for my first, my first year at grad school at MIT,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:38.080]   I would sometimes go to the Harvard co-op as they call it the coop. And I would it was on tables
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.120]   kind of hang around. People would pick up the book and look at it, but that's like how people
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.680]   discovered it at first. I didn't have a social, there was no social media back then. It wasn't on
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.080]   a big podcast. People would find it on tables and then it's all word of mouth. And what is going to
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.480]   make someone recommend a book to someone else? This worked, this made me get better grades.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   You should read it. My kid's grades got better after they read this. So what you want to look
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   for, if you want to align incentive structures with advice here is where you want to find a
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:15.440]   book on student study habit advice that just had a quiet entry into the marketplace and over time
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.680]   sell, sell, sell, sells. And I just looked it up before the show. I think the sales on how to
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.600]   concentrate a student is approaching 250,000 copies. A book that has never had any major
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.720]   promotion has never been talked about on a single major podcast show or had any footprint on social
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.800]   media. That's all word of mouth. So there you verify the incentive there for me to make that
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.000]   book sell that many copies. I was obsessed about this better work, what really works.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.760]   So books have a better incentive structure surrounding their information than YouTube does.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   So you buy my book or any other book that has sold a lot of copies that focus on this topic,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.120]   you're much more likely to get advice that works. And you're not going to hear anything
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.240]   about note-taking apps or to-do lists in that book. My book gets right down to the brass tacks
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.720]   of what are the different academic tasks you have to do? What is the right way to do these? How do
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.200]   you take information from a textbook and learn it efficiently to the point that you can do well on a
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.000]   test? How do you write a paper? How do you break that down into multiple steps so that it's a good
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.520]   paper that you're going to get good grades on? How do you learn mathematics to the level that
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.000]   you can sit down for a mathematics exam and get a really good score on it? Well, here's exactly how
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.760]   you want to organize your notes. Here's how you should study. These would make excessively boring
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.920]   YouTube videos from the perspective of the algorithm, but they also lead to notably high GPAs.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.320]   All right, so now let's come back to the oxymoronic fallacy early on. Aren't you hearing
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.120]   advice now on YouTube? Well, here's how I exempt what we're doing here is that if you're watching
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.640]   this on YouTube, what you are seeing is the video of a podcast, right? The podcast is the game here.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.920]   We put the video of the podcast on YouTube. Podcasting has a good incentive structure.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:10.400]   It's similar to books. There is not an algorithm to please. In other words, there's not a hard,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.560]   inscrutable, complex feedback mechanism that drives your content in podcasting. It is just
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.120]   like books. If someone likes your show, they will tell someone else about it and your audience grows
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:29.520]   a little bit. And that's how podcasts grow is people find what you're talking about to be
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.280]   effective enough that they will then go on to tell someone else about it. So that's what I think saves
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.360]   us here if you're watching this on YouTube is that what we're trying to do is get more podcast
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.600]   listeners. And I see that the exact same way as trying to get more book readers. The stuff's got
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.800]   to work. We play some tricks with the, uh, the thumbnails and the titles to try to get some
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.720]   algorithmic juice. Our YouTube guy does that, but the content comes out of the podcast.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:04.400]   So I think incentive structures matter. So keep that in mind. So, uh, peer YouTubers are not
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.600]   necessarily a great source of advice on a lot of topics. You want to find sources of advice
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.440]   where the incentive structure is for the advice to work. That's what's going to make it actually
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.560]   do better. Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well. Check it out.
