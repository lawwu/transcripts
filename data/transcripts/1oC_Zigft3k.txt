[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   What do you think is the mind of Einstein's god?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.300]   Do you think there's a why that we could untangle from this universe of strings?
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300]   Why are we here?
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.320]   What is the meaning of it all?
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.240]   Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize, once said that the more we learn about
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   the universe, the more we learn that it's pointless.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.400]   I don't profess to understand the great secrets of the universe.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.680]   However, let me say two things about what the giants of physics have said about this
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.280]   question.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.020]   Einstein believed in two types of God.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.640]   One was the God of the Bible, the personal God, the God that answers prayers, walks on
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.680]   waters, performs miracles, smites the Philistines.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.200]   That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   He believed in the God of Spinoza, the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.240]   The universe could have been ugly.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.760]   The universe could have been messy, random, but it's gorgeous.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.400]   He relates that on a single sheet of paper.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.520]   We can write down all the known laws of the universe.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   It's amazing.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.480]   On one sheet of paper, Einstein's equation is one inch long.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   Lang theory is a lot longer, and so is the standard model, but you could put all these
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.340]   equations on one sheet of paper.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.080]   It didn't have to be that way.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.720]   It could have been messy.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.040]   And so Einstein thought of himself as a young boy entering this huge library for the first
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.600]   time, being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance, and beauty of this library.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.360]   But all he could do was read the first page of the first volume.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.780]   Well, that library is the universe with all sorts of mysterious, magical things that we
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.920]   have yet to find.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.320]   And then Galileo was asked about this.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.000]   Galileo said that the purpose of science, the purpose of science is to determine how
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.120]   the heavens go.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.960]   The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.200]   So in other words, science is about natural law, and religion is about ethics, how to
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.900]   be a good person, how to go to heaven.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.440]   As long as we keep these two things apart, we're in great shape.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.240]   The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences begin to pontificate about ethics,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.640]   and people from religion begin to pontificate about natural law.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.320]   That's where we get into big trouble.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.280]   - You think they're fundamentally distinct, morality and ethics, and our idea of what
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.000]   is right and what is wrong.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.640]   That's something that's outside the reach of string theory and physics.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   - That's right.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.920]   If you talk to a squirrel about what is right and what is wrong, there's no reference frame
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.960]   for a squirrel.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.240]   And realize that aliens from outer space, if they ever come visit us, they'll try to
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.400]   talk to us like we talk to squirrels in the forest, but eventually we get bored talking
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.640]   to the squirrels because they don't talk back to us.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   Same thing with aliens from outer space.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.720]   They come down to Earth, they'll be curious about us to a degree, but after a while, they
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.440]   just get bored because we have nothing to offer them.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   So our sense of right and wrong, what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense of
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.040]   right and wrong?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.760]   Now we of course do have an ethics that keeps civilizations in line, enriches our life,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.940]   and makes civilization possible.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.520]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.040]   But it's not mandated by a law of physics.
