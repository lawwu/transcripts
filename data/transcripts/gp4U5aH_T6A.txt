[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   you can't have permanent war without fiat.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.600]   And I also think there's a case to be made
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.380]   that you can't really have fiat without war.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.520]   The following is a conversation with Seyfied Namous,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.880]   one of the central and most impactful economists,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600]   philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.480]   He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000]   and the author of "The Bitcoin Standard"
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.640]   and the new book, "The Fiat Standard."
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.760]   Seyfied does not mince words in his criticism of economists
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.800]   and humans in general with whom he disagrees.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.000]   For example, Paul Krugman,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.560]   who is a neo-Lackensian economist
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620]   and a previous guest of this podcast.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.760]   Seyfied's opinions are strong and often controversial.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760]   I do push back in this conversation,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360]   playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man each side.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.960]   But as always, I do so in the service of exploring
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.680]   the rich space of ideas that safety has about human nature
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680]   and human civilization.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.700]   I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.160]   to come to your own conclusions.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.600]   That is the burden of being a free-thinking human.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.820]   It is on each of us individually
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.840]   to dive into this chaos of ideas,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.120]   and from that chaos,
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.220]   discover long-lasting universal wisdom to live by.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.120]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   in the description.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.880]   And now, dear friends, here's Safetine Amoos.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.720]   Let's start with a big question.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600]   What is money?
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.040]   And what is the role of money
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.680]   in the history of human civilization?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.400]   Money is a medium of exchange.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.660]   The thing that defines money is that it is a good
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.820]   that you don't buy for its own sake,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.440]   because you wanna consume it itself,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.840]   or because you want to employ it
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.900]   in the production of other goods,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.440]   which is what capital goods are.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.840]   So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.520]   Money is distinct from those two,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   because it is a good that is acquired
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.920]   purely to be exchanged later on for other goods.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.800]   You acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.720]   And that's a market good.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.000]   That's a market good like all other goods.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080]   You acquire food because you eat it,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.120]   you acquire a car to move you around,
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880]   you acquire money so that you can exchange it
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.480]   for other goods.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.640]   And that's something that many people
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.040]   have a hard time grasping,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   the concept of money as a market good.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   But it is a market good, just like all others.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.440]   And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   it allows us to develop the division of labor,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.280]   which would not be possible
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   at any kind of sophisticated level without money.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.360]   So if we live in a small society of 10 people,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.560]   then think about all the things that we can make,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040]   all the things that we can produce.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.800]   If we're only 10 people isolated from the world,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   there's only very few things that we can make.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   And therefore we can exchange those things
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   directly with one another.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.720]   But as, you know, if we get in contact with other societies
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.160]   that have more people,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.640]   then the opportunities for specialization increase.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.760]   You know, if there's 10 people,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.880]   the only thing that you can make is the very basics
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.120]   you need for your survival.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.680]   But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.440]   there's much more room for specialization.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.820]   You can make a car, you can make a house
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.000]   that's very sophisticated.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.440]   And that relies on the division of labor.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   That relies on you specializing
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   and doing one tiny little thing,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.760]   which is not what you consume.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   You know, you trade that thing
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.680]   for all the things that you consume.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.600]   So as the economy becomes more sophisticated
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.920]   and involves more people,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   and currently we're all part of an economy
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680]   of almost 8 billion people,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.600]   each one of us produces one tiny little thing,
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.960]   and they exchange that thing
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.720]   for all the things that they want.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.400]   So because we specialize,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.600]   we become more productive
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.480]   in doing the thing that we're good at.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   So, you know, there's people out there who are engineers
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.000]   who are designing windshields in cars.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680]   It's a very specialized thing.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.200]   They sell windshield design to Mercedes-Benz.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   And then from that, you know,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.600]   that windshield design is added on
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.480]   to millions of cars around the world.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   And from that, they're able to get enough money
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.020]   to meet all of their needs.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.440]   So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.840]   because without money,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.720]   it's very difficult to be able to exchange
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   a large number of goods.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.160]   with a large degree of specialization,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.560]   because it's very difficult to find people
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.040]   who want the thing that you have
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.760]   and have the thing that you want.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.640]   We call this the coincidence of wants.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.720]   And that's really the problem that money solves.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   So you make apples and I make oranges.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.400]   I'd like to have some of your apples,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.080]   but you don't want my oranges.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.240]   And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.080]   So what do I do?
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.120]   You want bananas.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.280]   I need to find somebody who has bananas,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.240]   give them my oranges, take their bananas,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.880]   give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.440]   In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.840]   and will emerge in an economy
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.680]   as an economy becomes more sophisticated.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.920]   As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.760]   it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.360]   where we have the problem of coincidence of wants,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.640]   and the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.480]   And it can be anything.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   It can be a banana.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   It can be food stuff.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.160]   It can be any kind of good.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.840]   As long as I acquire the good
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   with the purpose of it passing it on to you,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.200]   not for the purpose of me consuming it or using it,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.840]   then that's a medium of exchange.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.920]   - So when we look at the entirety of human society
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.520]   of millions of billions of people,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.920]   you think of them just a bunch of individuals
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.360]   running around.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.520]   I love the term coincidence of wants.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.680]   So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.320]   They have desires.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   It's like a random collection of desires
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.000]   somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.600]   but mostly random in terms of preference
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.240]   of banana or apple, that kind of thing.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.360]   And then they also have the capacity
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   for competence and excellence in particular kind of labor.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.320]   So like specialization.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.120]   They're able to be incredible at a particular set of tasks.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.760]   So there's a bunch of ants running around
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.160]   with consciousness and intelligence.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.520]   And they have desires and they have capabilities.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   and the capabilities they have.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.300]   And you wanted to create a system
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.280]   that kind of exchanges those things.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.120]   So when you imagine what is a good,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.280]   what is markets, when you imagine a market
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.880]   is like a hierarchical system, what do you imagine?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.900]   What is a market?
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.920]   - A market is just the name
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.680]   for the naturally emergent phenomena
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280]   of people voluntarily exchanging things.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.040]   It's-- - At any scale.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.240]   - At any scale, yeah.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.160]   Individual, it could be a market of two people
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.560]   on an island on their own.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.040]   It could be 8 billion people across the planet.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.440]   - Naturally emerging.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   - Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   for many people who don't have a good understanding
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.880]   of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.480]   are not something that you need a central planner
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.840]   or a government officer to make happen.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.280]   Capitalism is just what happens
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.040]   when people are left to their own devices.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   It's just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.200]   that we can use for production.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.880]   And that's what we do.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's what humans have been doing
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.120]   since they started making spears to hunt.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.240]   That's the first capital good probably.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   So we're constantly accumulating capital.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.680]   We're constantly trading with one another.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.200]   We find an opportunity.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.480]   You've got a lot of oranges, I've got a lot of apples.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.600]   Then I'll take some of yours, you'll take some of mine.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.000]   We're both better off.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.880]   This is just a naturally emergent thing.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.040]   And money is what makes it enormously powerful.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.280]   Money is what allows it to scale really.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.280]   into just something that is global.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.880]   Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.040]   all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.280]   the thing that you do best,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.760]   and then you exchange that for money,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.240]   and you don't have to worry
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.280]   about whether the other people involved in this
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.560]   want what you have and have what you want.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.920]   You just sell it for money to whoever wants it,
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.800]   and you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.160]   And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.400]   of how a market economy functions.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   So the first thing that I would say about money
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.120]   is that it allows for the division of labor,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.360]   and it allows for the market system to grow.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.960]   And the second thing is that money is a mechanism
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.560]   for storing value into the future.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.720]   So again, as humans, we develop the capacity
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.840]   to think for the future.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.600]   We make a spear so that we can hunt,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.320]   and then we see that it works,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.640]   and then we take it out of the animal
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.920]   that we hunted it with,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.560]   and we keep it for the next day's hunt.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.080]   And then we start making a better spear,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.480]   and we make a better fishing rod,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.680]   and then we make a fishing net,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.320]   and then we make a fishing boat.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.160]   And that's our ability to think of the future.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.960]   And as we start building durable goods,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.800]   we start thinking more and more of the future.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.920]   We start becoming more and more future-oriented.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.560]   And that's really the process of civilization,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.440]   the process of denying our needs now
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.120]   in order to think for the future.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.720]   So instead of spending all of our day on the beach,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.480]   on the beach and spend some time making a spear
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.280]   or making a fishing rod so that our productivity
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.120]   in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.800]   And so that ability to think for the future
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.640]   is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.800]   And we do that with durable goods.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.720]   But then money ends up being the best mechanism
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.120]   for providing for the future
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.400]   because the future is uncertain.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.920]   So you can save your apples and oranges,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.560]   you can save the spears,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   you can save the animal that you hunted.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.200]   But these things, first they rot,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.560]   they're not very good at holding onto their value over time.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.120]   But even if they were,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.400]   even if you have objects that are durable,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.360]   the problem with them is that you don't know
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.160]   if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.280]   You're not sure if you're going to be needing them.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.880]   And you might end up not needing them.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.920]   And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.160]   or finding somebody who needs them
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.400]   but doesn't value them much
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.360]   and won't give you much in exchange.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.040]   Money allows you the optionality
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.760]   of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   So it's something that you can sell tomorrow
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.720]   with the least uncertainty.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.760]   It has the most liquidity,
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.520]   the most ability to be sold without a loss in its value.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.480]   So money is our most advanced technology
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   and our best technology for moving value into the future.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.360]   And so I think history really,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.680]   I argue this in all my books,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.400]   is that really history, we see,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.640]   we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.880]   And so our money gets better
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.040]   at holding onto its value for the future.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.560]   And by harder, I mean harder to produce.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   We find things that are hard to produce
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.080]   that are better at holding onto their value.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.400]   So they hold onto their value better for the future.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   And that allows us to plot and plan for the future.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.160]   That makes the future less uncertain.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.960]   And that makes us more future-oriented.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.600]   In other words, it lowers our time preference.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.800]   And the harder the money is,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.480]   the better it is allowing us to think of the future.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.040]   - So people should know that you've written the book
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.440]   Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.280]   - Yeah.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.200]   - And then a new book called Fiat Standard.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.400]   The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.760]   in the cryptocurrency space and the Bitcoin space
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.720]   of just a very rigorous systematic explanation
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.360]   of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.440]   why is it good?
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.760]   So you're describing in that book and in the new book,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.600]   different implementations of the technology of money.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.520]   In the new book, you talk about fiat money,
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.480]   which is another way to do money.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.600]   So obviously there's a lot of different ways to do money.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.680]   And maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money yet.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.240]   Our conversation today is how to do money better.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.080]   - Right.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960]   Very good reasons why we won't.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.160]   - Well, we can disagree.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.320]   We can agree to disagree on this.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.280]   I'm open-minded to the bananas.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.040]   One of the biggest source of joy to me
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.960]   when I first came to this country is eating bananas.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.360]   will eventually become the best medium of exchange.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.120]   Open-minded.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.400]   So there's different ways to do money.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.480]   What is hard money?
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.280]   What is soft money?
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   - In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.760]   that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.400]   Historically, I think we see many examples of that.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.040]   So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.240]   because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.160]   In societies, we have the example of Yap Island,
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.040]   for instance.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.000]   It's an island that doesn't have any limestone,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.280]   but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.520]   And it's very expensive, obviously,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.560]   with primitive technology to move limestone
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.120]   from Palau to Yap.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.560]   So on Yap, limestones were money.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.960]   Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.160]   end up serving as money in places where they're rare.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.640]   Glass beads were money in West Africa
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   where there was no glass-making technology
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.600]   because they were imported from abroad
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.200]   and they were very hard to make.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.320]   And I think there's a conscious effort
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.200]   of some people might recognize the hardness
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.400]   and the scarcity and choose this as money.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.840]   But I think what's more important
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.400]   is just a natural evolutionary process
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.840]   whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.520]   bananas maybe even.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   But then the people who end up making these bad choices
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.880]   don't end up with any wealth left.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.280]   Whereas the people who store their wealth
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.000]   in the things that are hard to make
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.080]   and maybe even increasing it over time.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.960]   And of course, this culminated in the 19th century,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.120]   in the end of the 19th century
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.880]   by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.600]   - What is a gold standard?
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.760]   - The gold standard is basically when money is gold
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.680]   or at least government currencies backed by gold.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.720]   But the reason gold became money
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.080]   and not copper, not nickel, not bananas
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.120]   is that gold is the hardest metal in the world
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.880]   and it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.960]   And the reason for that is based in chemistry.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.040]   So gold is indestructible.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.640]   It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.360]   The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.000]   is today probably in somebody's necklace
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   or in somebody's gold coin, it's still there.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.000]   So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.240]   They dig it out of the ground, they refine it
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.840]   and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.400]   and then it just stays there.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.880]   It gets melted down into new other forms.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   The jewelry gets turned into coins
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.160]   or coins get turned into bars.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.520]   But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   On the other hand, every year we get better
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.880]   at our technology of looking for gold.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.360]   There's more people all over the world.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.840]   The population increases, the technology improves.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.920]   So we keep finding more and more gold
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.040]   and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.200]   However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.880]   that is not being devalued, sorry,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.240]   that is not being consumed
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.560]   because there's no way of consuming gold.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.740]   You can't eat it, you can't burn it, it doesn't rust.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.280]   Because of that, we're constantly adding
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.880]   to a constantly growing stockpile.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.960]   So if you look at the numbers,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.200]   you see over the last 100 years,
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.600]   we've got pretty reliable data
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.320]   on gold production worldwide.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.680]   We see that pretty much gold stockpiles
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.400]   increase at around one and a half to 2% per year,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.440]   every year.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.120]   So yes, we're making more every year,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.040]   but we're making more so we're adding to the stockpile.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.160]   The stockpile grows more.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.520]   So every year we're adding only around one and a half
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.360]   to 2%.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.520]   Compare that to the second hardest metal
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.120]   historically was silver.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.880]   And that increased historically
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.680]   at around maybe 5% per year or so.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.800]   Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30%
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.120]   because it's now getting used extensively
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.800]   in industrial uses.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.680]   So when you use it in industry,
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.360]   you know, when you put silver in a laptop
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.200]   or in a camera or in a machine,
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.000]   effectively you are consuming the stockpile
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.560]   because it's not used as money.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880]   It's taken out of the monetary stockpile.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.280]   So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.960]   and I discussed this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   what happened in 1870 was Germany won
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.440]   the Franco-Prussian War
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.960]   and Germany was on a silver standard,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   but the value of silver was declining.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.640]   So Germany did something very smart,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   which is they took their indemnity from France
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.480]   in gold and used that big chunk of gold
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.040]   to switch to going on a gold standard.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.720]   And since then, silver has been collapsing in value
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.560]   next to gold.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   So back then the price of an ounce of gold
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   was around 15 ounces of silver.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.440]   Today it's closer to 100.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.560]   It's just been declining for the last 150 years.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.520]   And so because of that,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.760]   because of the fact that it's lost its monetary role
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.920]   as people shifted toward gold,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.600]   the value of silver went down.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.160]   And so it became economical to use it
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.320]   in more and more industrial applications.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.360]   So the stockpile declines.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.920]   And then as a result,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.240]   that weakens its monetary properties
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.800]   more and more and more.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.560]   So that's why by the end of the 19th century,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.880]   I mean, at the beginning of the 19th century,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.160]   gold and silver were money.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   By the end, it was basically only gold.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.840]   And the countries that were still on a silver standard,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.440]   China and India in particular,
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.720]   suffered enormously from it
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.600]   because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.880]   And so Europeans who would come to China or India
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.320]   were able to buy things at practically a big discount.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.560]   - So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.600]   very basic questions.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.720]   There's few people in this world that are good,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.200]   as good as you are at answering very basic,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.960]   almost ridiculously basic questions.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.000]   'Cause I think exploring questions like what is money
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.120]   is a really great way to think from first principles,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.800]   to really think deeply about this world.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.680]   So I really appreciate you doing that.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.600]   When you say standard, what does it mean?
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   When you say silver standard, gold standard,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.960]   again, with the basic question.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.840]   - The term really, I think, was based out of gold.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.400]   The first time this came out was the gold standard.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   So I said gold was money at the end of the 19th century,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.560]   but it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.080]   and trading with gold coins,
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.360]   because that's got a problem of divisibility.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.440]   So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.200]   So how do you buy that thing?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.120]   And the answer was that you created monetary instruments
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.200]   that were backed by gold.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.640]   And so currencies, national currencies
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.800]   under the gold standard, were specific units of gold.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.000]   And that's how a gold standard functioned.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.920]   that were redeemable in gold.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.080]   So you could go to the central bank,
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.960]   you'd give them the piece of paper,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.160]   the $100 bill or the $10 bill,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.000]   and they'll give you gold in exchange.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   And they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.240]   Effectively, the paper was just the receipt for gold.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.480]   - So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.920]   - Exactly, that was the plan.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.200]   Or that was what it's supposed to do.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.280]   But arguably, we never had a pure gold standard
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.680]   because the nature of gold means that the people
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.040]   who are in charge of the gold,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.520]   they have an enormous amount of power
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.160]   because the gold is concentrated with them.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.840]   And as long as not everybody shows up at the same time
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.880]   asking for their gold,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.920]   then you can make more receipts than you have gold.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.200]   - Sure, so there's always shady stuff going on,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.160]   but at least that's the state of gold,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.360]   is the receipts should exactly represent
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.880]   the amount of gold there.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.760]   And also when you say standard,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   it means that governments sort of publicly stated
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.520]   that this is the approved,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.080]   the main way of making transactions that are monetary.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.760]   So this is the money, this is the official money
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.800]   that you should be using if you live in this country.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.360]   - Yes, although I would say it's more like
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.180]   the other way around.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.440]   It's not that the government's established gold as money.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.040]   It's more like gold gave the governments
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.920]   the credibility for their currencies.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.320]   So governments were not the ones that made gold money.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.480]   Gold has been money before states were invented.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.240]   States, if you have a government
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.200]   and you'd like to have some legitimacy
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.600]   and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.800]   on an equal footing, you have to go by the gold standard.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.480]   You have to have a currency that was redeemable in gold
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.120]   so that you could trade with the rest of the world
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.160]   so that people could, in your country, use that currency.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.120]   So it's not that governments were choosing gold.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.480]   It's more like they were having to adapt
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.760]   their own currencies to gold
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.400]   in order to give their currencies credibility.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.000]   - So there's a dance there though,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.580]   because if they had to,
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.520]   then why did they switch away from it after?
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.640]   So there is a dance where the governments,
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.160]   the people pressure.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   So first of all, the basic characteristics of the hard money
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.880]   pressures the governments and the people
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.740]   in terms of what should be used.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.200]   Then the people, based on their community,
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   the network effects, the way they,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.240]   the narratives they tell each other,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.400]   all that kind of stuff,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.420]   they pressure the governments
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.080]   to take on a particular money.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.900]   And then the governments, you know,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.800]   they like power, they like control,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.760]   all those kinds of things.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.120]   They pressure the people
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.320]   and tell different kinds of narratives.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.880]   So there's a dance going on in this evolution
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.360]   of what technology to use for a monetary system.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.900]   So it's, the reason I,
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.360]   I don't know if governments had to,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.240]   because they clearly didn't have to
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.640]   because they eventually moved away from it.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.040]   So it, but there was pressure probably.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   - Yeah, but I mean, even after they moved away from it,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.520]   you know, central banks until today,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.000]   they still hold a lot of gold reserves.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.440]   In fact, if you look at 1914,
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.080]   when the world really went off the gold standard,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.720]   the amount of gold reserves held by central banks
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   was a tiny fraction of what it was.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.480]   As time went on, central banks accumulated
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.840]   more and more gold.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.160]   What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.240]   from using the gold, but they continued to use it.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.560]   So gold continued to be money up until 1971,
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.800]   because effectively the world was on a dollar standard
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.960]   and the dollars were backed by gold.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.600]   But then after 1971, even then, you know,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.280]   central banks continue to accumulate gold
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.960]   because why would you as a central bank
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.480]   want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.200]   or credit liabilities of another central bank
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.920]   that can produce them infinitely?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.760]   And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.040]   to governments today, you know, as we see US sanctions
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.920]   taking say Russian reserves or Afghanistan reserves.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.800]   And this is why, you know, we see China and Russia
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.040]   have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.360]   - So just to return to the question of definitions,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.960]   so what is hard money versus soft money?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.080]   - Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.520]   but the hardness refers to the difficulty
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.480]   of producing more units of the money supply.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   So an easy money would be a money
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.400]   that is relatively easy to make.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.760]   So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.600]   or something like that.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.480]   other than gold and silver, they're easy money
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.840]   and they're not suitable as a monetary medium
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.120]   because they're being consumed.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.280]   So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.020]   I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.780]   which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow,
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.440]   to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.080]   If you look at all the other metals,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.120]   they're easy money because they're being consumed.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.320]   So think about how much stockpiles of copper
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.080]   there are in the world today.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.880]   So copper companies obviously have
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.000]   some stockpiles of copper.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.040]   Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.840]   but the vast majority of copper is essentially
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.440]   on a conveyor belt of production from the mine
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   straight to the consumer good that it's being used for.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.740]   So the existing stockpiles are roughly in the range
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.880]   of one year's production.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.760]   If you take all of the companies,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   I don't have exact statistics,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.420]   and it's very difficult to get these,
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.740]   but it's roughly in the same range.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.240]   Like if copper production were to stop completely today,
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.480]   we'll have about a year's production
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.000]   stored in various places.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.720]   So that makes copper terrible money
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.360]   because if you started using copper as money,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.920]   and this is why a lot of people say,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.680]   well, money is a collective illusion.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.260]   Money is a social construct.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.960]   If we all agree that something is money,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.800]   then something is money.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.880]   I think this is completely clueless,
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.760]   and it's usually Marxists who believe this,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.260]   so obviously no understanding of economics.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.640]   It's completely clueless because even if everybody
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.880]   in society decided we wanted to make copper as money,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.960]   even if we all decided to collectively take part
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.320]   in this hallucination or illusion,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.980]   it would not make copper money.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.240]   It would just make everybody who decides to take part
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.500]   in this hallucination poor, that's it.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.040]   It would make copper miners rich,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.240]   it would make all of the people
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.160]   who chose copper as money poor,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.640]   and copper would not be money.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.720]   It can't work because what happens is
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.260]   because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.660]   if you buy, even if you get the 1,000 richest people
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.260]   in the world, all of the world's billionaires,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.260]   they get together and they all dump all of the money
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.960]   that they have, all the stocks, all the bonds,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.460]   all the gold, all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own,
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.500]   they dump it and they buy copper with it.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.340]   What's gonna happen?
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.840]   Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.660]   but what's gonna stop copper miners from flooding the market
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.780]   with even more copper than what the billionaires bought?
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.620]   Nothing.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.900]   They're gonna dump all of that extra copper production.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.080]   If the price of copper is gonna go up,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.700]   so there will be a lot more copper mining
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.140]   than all the other metals.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   A lot of nickel companies and gold miners
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.540]   are gonna switch to focusing on copper.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.740]   And then we're gonna dump an enormous amount
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.060]   of copper on the market.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.060]   The value of copper is gonna crash,
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.620]   and the people who chose copper as money
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.820]   are just gonna end up with large warehouses
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.540]   of very cheap, rusting metal.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.980]   - So that's a brilliant description,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.940]   and that kind of pushes towards gold,
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.020]   where the stock-to-flow ratio, I guess you would say,
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.900]   is 1.5 to 2%, like you mentioned earlier.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.740]   - That would be like the inverse of the stock-to-flow.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.020]   That's the supply growth rate,
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.340]   so the stock-to-flow's the inverse.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.620]   It's around 60.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.740]   - 60, got it.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.060]   But let me push back on,
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.900]   as somebody who likes human psychology,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.020]   let me push back on the collective hallucination
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.180]   and the illusion.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.940]   So that's for copper, but what about paper money?
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   That's not, you can't smoke it, you can't eat it.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.820]   It's supposed to represent,
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.220]   it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:53.580]   In that sense, what role does collective hallucination play
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.020]   in the effectiveness of money?
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.060]   - Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.900]   first of all, there's never been an instance,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.900]   and again, this flies in the face of a lot of what,
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.140]   a lot of people like to think about money.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.420]   There's never been an instance
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.940]   where a government came out and said,
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.700]   all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.540]   use them as money.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.020]   This one is worth 10 apples, or use it for buying things,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.900]   and here's the piece of paper.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.340]   This has never happened.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.340]   They've always taken, fiat money, paper money,
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.660]   all of these things were always born out of fraud.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.700]   Initially, it was a receipt for gold,
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.020]   and then they told you, well, you don't need the gold anyway
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.820]   and you have to use this, and then if you don't use it,
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.420]   we throw you in jail.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.580]   And then, so first of all, it doesn't,
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.340]   you can't enforce this thing,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.660]   so it's never really just happened,
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.320]   and it's never been hallucinated into existence.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.080]   People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.340]   in writing textbooks and books and in academia,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.540]   but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.140]   People are very careful about what they put their money in.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.500]   - For people listening,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.100]   we're gonna have fun in this conversation,
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.580]   'cause you're like, you already said Marxist,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.780]   fraud, hallucination, just because we use these words
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.900]   doesn't mean they're true, but they're fun to talk about.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.220]   So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.100]   which I think is fun.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.420]   But allow me in my dumb self to push back,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.740]   to play devil's advocate, and I'll actually ask you
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.180]   sometimes to play devil's advocate if possible,
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.880]   'cause you're smarter than me on all this stuff,
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.520]   so we want the smartest devil's advocate possible,
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.960]   and I'm certainly not that.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   But anyway, but nevertheless,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.440]   we are currently on the fiat standard,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   so money does have value, paper money,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.880]   and the reason it has value
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.760]   is because we believe it has value.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.240]   the belief that something is worth value
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.080]   is actually value and is the thing that helps money work?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.240]   'Cause you're saying it's fraud,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.780]   and the belief is almost valueless.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.280]   But how much value, can we quantify the value
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.440]   of the belief, the collective belief?
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.680]   - I should say, all economics is subjective.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.160]   I consider myself an Austrian school economist,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.740]   and the starting point of all Austrian economics
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.880]   is that all value is subjective.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.280]   So obviously, value only exists
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.880]   because humans choose to make the valuation.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.000]   However, the economic reality of the way that money works
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.640]   means that it's just the technology, like all others.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.040]   And so, for me, when people say,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   then it'll be money.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.880]   If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.840]   then it'll be money.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.360]   For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.920]   that bananas can be spaceships, they'll be spaceships.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.940]   I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.660]   but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.060]   - But nevertheless, that's true.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.040]   So you're drawing a big distinction
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.300]   between physical reality and the space of belief.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   But it seems like so much power of human civilization,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.980]   so much destruction, so much creativity,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.180]   creation happens in our minds.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.180]   - Absolutely.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.500]   Everything does happen in the mind.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.960]   You're not gonna get to the moon,
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.580]   but you might still have a significant impact
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.540]   on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.420]   - True, but economic reality exists in a way
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.940]   in which your beliefs are rewarded
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.740]   when they match up with economic reality.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.620]   - With physical reality.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.900]   - And they're punished when they don't.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.740]   So if you ride a banana, jump off a cliff
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.940]   thinking you're gonna get to the moon,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.620]   that solves the problem of people thinking
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.620]   that bananas are spaceships by killing people
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.060]   who think that bananas are spaceships.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.020]   And I think to go back to your question
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.820]   in terms of paper money, so yes,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.380]   even though ignoring the original sin
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.980]   of the creation of fiat money
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.420]   and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.860]   all right, well, here we are, people are using,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.340]   well, it's not really paper money.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.820]   We should say like fiat money is predominantly credit.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.020]   So it's also a digital currency.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.780]   So more than 90% of dollars are digital,
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.380]   less than 10% of dollars are physical.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.760]   So it is a digital currency.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.740]   And all over the world, all these governments
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.460]   are using digital currencies effectively
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.520]   with some physical manifestations in paper.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.420]   But yet even within these currencies,
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.780]   it's still the same analysis.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.320]   And I discussed this in chapter four of the Bitcoin Standard.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.740]   You look at government monies,
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.180]   you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.220]   the ones that have the biggest value,
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.700]   the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.940]   the ones that are used as currency reserves
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.140]   all over the world,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.900]   are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.640]   The ones that grow,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.420]   whose central banks are the least inflationary.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.460]   And on the other hand,
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.920]   the ones that who supplies more inflationary,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.940]   similar to copper, end up failing.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.500]   You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.560]   These are currencies whose supply increases very quickly.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.060]   And therefore their value collapses.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.540]   Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the Euro,
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.940]   the British pound, the Japanese yen,
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.180]   they increase at a much lower rate in general
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.260]   than these terrible currencies.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.980]   And that's why all over the world,
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.220]   you see people are looking to get more dollars
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.420]   So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.420]   and the ease of money is pretty well supported empirically.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.840]   - So like you said, you're at least in part or in whole,
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   consider yourself an Austrian economist.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.020]   So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.540]   What is Austrian economics?
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.260]   What is Keynesian economics?
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.700]   How do you compare the two?
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.740]   What should people know?
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.300]   Some interesting, what is interesting,
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.740]   defining characteristics to you about these schools of thought?
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.380]   - So Austrian economics, the way that I say it,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.980]   Austrian economics is economics.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.680]   We call it Austrian economics
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.440]   because economics has been hijacked
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.460]   by a bunch of frauds, really.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.880]   - People who are wrong, okay.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.540]   - Well, it's much worse than wrong,
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.660]   by people who are just essentially propagandists
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.500]   for inflation.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.500]   - Right.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.340]   - It's like your opinion, man.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.940]   (laughing)
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.860]   - Well, that's also like your opinion, man.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.740]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.620]   Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast,
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.780]   so he's, the O speaks enough,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.660]   but he's one of the people that is perhaps
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.860]   most harshly criticized by folks
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.340]   in Austrian economics perspective and vice versa,
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.780]   which is a fascinating tension.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.980]   - Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.380]   who plays an economist on TV and the internet.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.460]   (laughing)
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.460]   - So anyway, now tell me what you really think.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.620]   No, but so the basics of what is Austrian economics?
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.620]   What perspective does it take on the world?
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.020]   - Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.940]   the continuation of a tradition that it goes back
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.700]   to the ancient Greeks of studying economics.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.300]   Historically, it's really just economics
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.660]   and that has evolved over time
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   and the establishment of the Austrian school per se
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.540]   came in 1871, 150 years ago,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.540]   when Karl Menger, the father of the school,
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.140]   wrote a book called "Principles of Economics"
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.860]   and essentially invented marginal analysis,
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.820]   which is a big deal in economics.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.340]   Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.820]   individuals carry out decisions at the margin,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.700]   that it's when you make a choice, you're not making it,
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.020]   for instance, if you're making a choice
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.780]   between what should I spend my money on,
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.740]   you're not making a choice whether it is,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.860]   this thing is object A or B,
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.900]   which one is more valuable for me in general,
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.780]   which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.420]   You're choosing about the next unit right now,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.980]   at this point, at this stage.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.100]   And if you analyze economic decision-making at the margin,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.060]   it makes a lot more sense and you can understand
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.760]   why people decide and make the decisions that they do.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.580]   Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis,
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.360]   things don't make sense.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.260]   The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.820]   is what is called the water diamond paradox.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.460]   So you will die without water, we all need water,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.860]   and yet water is dirt cheap.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.300]   Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.340]   nobody needs them, nobody's gonna live or die
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.680]   because they have a diamond,
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.500]   and yet they're extremely expensive.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.040]   So why is it that as human beings,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.720]   we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.180]   whereas we pay thousands of dollars
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.980]   for a few grams of diamonds.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.180]   Why is this the case?
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.260]   Do we value water less than diamond?
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.360]   The answer is no, but at the margin,
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.980]   where we are right now,
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.900]   you live in a place where water is very abundant
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.900]   because cities are only built in places
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.620]   where water is abundant.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.520]   And you're only making a choice
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.340]   about the next unit of water.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.300]   And so water is extremely abundant
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.420]   and you're choosing about whether to spend
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.620]   the next unit of money on water.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.460]   The valuation that you give to water,
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.940]   given that you have a lot of water at home,
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.440]   and that you live in a place that has abundant water,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.700]   is pretty low to the marginal unit.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.000]   But it's very high for water overall.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.460]   So if I asked you,
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.020]   how much would you spend for water in general?
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.000]   How much would you pay for water for all of your life?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.020]   It would be a lot higher than diamonds.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.220]   If I told you you can only have water or diamonds
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.380]   for the rest of your life, you'd choose water, obviously.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.980]   But nobody's ever had to make that choice.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.280]   You only make your choices at the margin.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.320]   So at the margin, where we are, modern civilization,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.580]   we have an abundance of water,
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.140]   that's why we have civilization,
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.020]   and diamonds are very rare and scarce.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.100]   And people are only buying,
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.100]   you know, you buy your first diamond
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.820]   when you're gonna get married,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.340]   you give it to your wife,
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.700]   and that's gonna be the first few grams of diamond
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.540]   that she's ever gonna own.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.180]   - I'm giving my wife water.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.060]   (laughing)
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.900]   - Smart move.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.260]   You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.700]   I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.140]   of how many Bitcoin we could have had
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.380]   if I'd bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.940]   - What's the downside, by the way,
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.700]   diamonds from the analysis of like gold and so on?
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.200]   - Ah, that's a great question.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.540]   Um, arguably diamonds are a scam.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.860]   (laughing)
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.500]   Because they became popular as a thing in marriage,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.060]   after gold was banned,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.780]   after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s,
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.460]   and in many places around the world.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.900]   So before that you'd give gold,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.180]   and the reason you'd give gold in a dowry, in a wedding,
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.020]   is because, you know, it wasn't just that it's pretty
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.740]   and shiny, it's because it's money.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.780]   So, you know, if you die,
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.460]   your wife can take the gold and she can live off of it.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.860]   It's a demonstration that you're giving her
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.180]   something valuable.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.780]   And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.140]   that has the high stock to flow ratio.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.700]   But then they banned gold ownership,
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.100]   or they allowed people to only own
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.780]   very tiny quantities of gold.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.400]   And that's when the diamond industry stepped in
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.340]   and marketed diamonds as, you know,
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.940]   the thing that you need to give.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.500]   But the problem with it is, of course,
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.780]   that diamonds aren't like gold.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.100]   They're not very hard to make more of.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.700]   And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.580]   is really artificial.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.420]   There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.580]   They restrict the supply,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.060]   and it's a pretty dirty business.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.300]   And the way that they do it is, you know,
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.140]   all of the talk about blood diamonds
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.300]   is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.180]   So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers,
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.340]   then it doesn't matter how many people get killed
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.380]   producing your diamonds.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.860]   If you're out of the monopoly,
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.660]   then human rights organizations descend on you
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.220]   and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.620]   And they're also restricting the production
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.460]   of artificial diamonds.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.300]   This is the other thing.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.460]   You can make artificial diamond,
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.460]   but you can't make artificial gold.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.060]   So they restrict the production of artificial diamond,
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.540]   and they try and insist that, you know,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.460]   you shouldn't take artificial diamonds,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.860]   but they're indistinguishable from real diamonds.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.340]   So it's an artificial scarcity,
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.140]   and I think there's gonna come a point at some point
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.380]   that this monopoly's gonna break,
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.900]   and a lot of people are gonna be left
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.900]   with essentially highly devalued jewelry.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.780]   - I'm gonna take this segment of the podcast,
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.580]   when I'm getting married, I'm gonna send it,
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.660]   and then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.660]   - Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.140]   - So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.380]   is the thing that allows you
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.900]   to most accurately capture human nature,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.820]   the actual day-to-day decisions that we humans make.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.620]   - Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics, so 1870.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.220]   And that was Menger's work.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.620]   And then he had a student, Adrian Bomberg,
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.060]   who developed capital theory,
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.100]   and then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.660]   who is arguably the most important economist ever,
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.660]   and he developed a theory of money,
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.020]   and he wrote a book in 1912
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.460]   called "The Theory of Money and Credit."
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.220]   And then in the '40s, he wrote "Human Action,"
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.340]   which is a big treatise on economics.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.380]   And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.380]   And before World War I, this was just known as economics.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.620]   And then after what happened in World War I,
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.780]   and I discussed this in detail in "The Fiat Standard,"
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.260]   is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.260]   and tried to pass off their own credit
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.820]   as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.780]   And incidentally here, this is part of the history
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.140]   that is not discussed often.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.400]   This is presented as an innovation.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.900]   Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.300]   that would justify what they did.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.380]   And later on, it's presented as,
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.180]   "Oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.900]   and now look, we've built this thing
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   that is better than gold,
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.520]   where now the government can just print money
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.380]   whenever it wants,
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.000]   and now gold money is not an issue anymore,"
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.060]   which is extremely idiotic,
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.140]   because the whole point of money
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.400]   is that it's not easy to make.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.940]   If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.540]   It's just destroying the entire function of money.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.980]   And we've seen that happen extensively
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.420]   in the 20th century,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.900]   after countries went off the gold standard.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.140]   So essentially, Keynesian economics
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.740]   is just inflation apologia.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.980]   It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.260]   And it's profoundly nonsensical.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.260]   It's built on the idea that if you just make more money,
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.500]   you can stimulate economic production.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.460]   And of course, this is very self-serving
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.220]   to the central banks and to the banks
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.300]   and to the governments who promote this nonsense.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.740]   And this is also very pervasive.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.340]   If you've had the misfortune of studying at a university
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.740]   over the last century,
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.860]   you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.060]   You were taught that if there's a problem in the economy,
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.620]   the way to fix it is that the government prints money,
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.460]   the government lowers the interest rate,
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.340]   and then that leads to more economic production,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.900]   which is completely nonsensical.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.260]   - So, (laughs)
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.480]   so you're, again, for the listener,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.900]   you're using strong words,
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.940]   push back just to find,
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.460]   to please devil's advocate
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.420]   to hopefully one day arrive at a truth.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.060]   So, just because it's in the interest
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   of the central banks and the government,
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.860]   the interests and the models of Keynesian economics
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.460]   and the government are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.860]   So let's give them a chance.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.260]   So, the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.420]   is that inflation is good in moderation
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.060]   as it encourages spending,
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.740]   but too much is bad because it completely devalues,
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.260]   destroys people's savings.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.740]   So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.160]   And I mean, I suppose this is one of the things
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.100]   that's supported by Keynesian economics.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.020]   Why is that wrong? - This is basically
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.620]   the whole point of Keynesian economics,
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.420]   is to try and find an endless array of explanations
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.780]   to explain why inflation is a good thing.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.340]   - Well, the chicken and the egg.
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.540]   So that's the cynical take.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.000]   This is a propaganda machine
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.060]   to sell the government's narrative.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.300]   The less cynical take is this bunch of economists who--
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.820]   - Who figured out this thing
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.340]   and it happens to be good for banks and governments.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.860]   And just because it's good for them doesn't mean--
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.980]   - And it justifies the existence of government
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:50.620]   and your basic, I don't think it's your basic assumption,
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.660]   but a foundational principle of your thought
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.660]   is that a lot of government is not a good thing.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.440]   Your first gut instinct, government bad.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.940]   Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.140]   who probably beats you on the intensity
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.060]   and how quickly he says government bad.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   So, but there's a potential argument for government good.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.020]   Some government is good, maybe a lot of government is good.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.260]   Maybe we need a lot of centralized management
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.860]   for resource allocation and so on
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.900]   because we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.980]   So there's an argument for that that exists.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.140]   You probably disagree with any possible argument
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.220]   in that side, but anyway,
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.780]   so why is that idea of Keynesian economics wrong?
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.540]   - I'm gonna focus for this on the money idea,
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.340]   the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.220]   The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.260]   without inflation, people wouldn't spend
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.900]   and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.180]   And that's nonsensical because people spend
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.020]   not because they wanna keep this magical monster
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.020]   called the economy going.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.900]   People spend because they need to consume
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.540]   because that's how we live, that's how we survive.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.300]   You need to eat, you need shelter,
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.500]   you need clothes to keep you warm.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.740]   And as technology advances,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.020]   the capabilities of the things that we can do
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   with our time increases and so we wanna buy more things.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.340]   So people buy things because people want to consume.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.580]   There's a limitless desire to consume.
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.580]   There's no shortage of reasons for people to consume,
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:33.380]   whether it's food or Ferraris or private jets.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.340]   People just always wanna buy more.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.980]   - Can I interrupt just really quick?
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.020]   What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:45.020]   where they might want to buy things,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.140]   but they're really afraid because it seems like
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.340]   there's a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.700]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.780]   - So fear of uncertainty, can you have too much fear?
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.660]   - Here's the thing, what I was saying is
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.460]   I was making the point that we don't need
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.140]   to be motivated to consume.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.180]   Like we have the insatiable desire to consume.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.500]   Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.420]   Everybody would like to have a bigger house.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.300]   Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house,
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.220]   but everybody would like a house.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.780]   Everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.940]   electronics, machines.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.980]   So we don't need a desire to consume.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.540]   But of course the limit on how much we consume
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.340]   is opportunity cost.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.860]   Why don't you buy a Ferrari?
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.340]   Well, because that's really expensive
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.180]   and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari,
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.940]   but I mean, most people don't buy a Ferrari
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.740]   because it's too expensive.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.900]   They can't afford it.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.900]   They'd have to work too hard to get it.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.140]   And if they do get it, it might mean that, you know,
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.540]   they can't afford their house anymore.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.500]   So we have to economize.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.700]   That's a good thing.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.940]   And we have to also think of the future.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.980]   And so humans consume,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.100]   that we don't need more motivation to consume.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.540]   We have to deal with the economic reality
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.020]   of the things that limit us from consuming more.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.740]   So what Keynesians present is that
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.700]   when there is a problem in the economy,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.580]   like there was after World War I,
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.740]   the problem is always caused by the inflation.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.900]   And what the Keynesian hucksters do
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.300]   is that they look at the consequences of inflation
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.580]   and blame it on people not spending enough.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.180]   When people are doing the rational thing,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.340]   you know, the money is,
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.500]   so there was inflation,
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.380]   caused an unsustainable boom, it caused a recession.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.060]   And now a lot of people lost their jobs
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.500]   and they don't have enough money to go out
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.940]   and spend frivolously.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.380]   So they save for the future.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.700]   The future is uncertain.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.860]   That's a good thing.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.380]   You know, that's how you fix things.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.300]   You begin the recovery by,
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.900]   well, you know, you lost some wealth,
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.740]   so you spend less.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.780]   Like if your business goes bust,
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.580]   if you lose your job,
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.740]   it's natural and smart that you stop spending money
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.180]   on the frivolous things that you used to spend.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.500]   And you save it for the future.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.220]   You invest in something else, you get a new job.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.340]   And then once you've recovered, you start spending more.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.900]   This is very sane and very good.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.260]   And it's the way to recovery.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.660]   But essentially the Keynesians have used this
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.420]   as a justification for more inflation.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.300]   Because inflation is an addiction.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   Once the government gets down the path
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.780]   of spending money to solve its problems,
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.820]   then every problem looks like it can be solved
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.780]   by more inflation.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.420]   And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.300]   And of course, the Keynesian economics
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.540]   is based on the work of Keynes,
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.940]   which came in the 1930s.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.100]   And this is the key point.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.740]   Like it's portrayed in the textbook
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.620]   as if it's just this scientific breakthrough.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.300]   That somebody in the 1930s, this genius,
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.860]   came about and realized that,
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.300]   oh, we don't actually need gold.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.300]   We don't need hard money.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.660]   We can actually just print all the money.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.940]   And in reality, of course,
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:02.500]   it was just the very thin, flimsy, idiotic justification
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.140]   for what governments were already doing for 20 years.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.580]   They'd already gone off the gold standard.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.900]   And they'd gone through 20 years
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   in which they were lying to their population,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.740]   telling their population,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.020]   we're still on a gold standard,
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.460]   but there are problems caused by various random things.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.300]   But don't worry,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.780]   we're gonna be going back on the gold standard.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.980]   20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.060]   they come up with this justification for why,
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.860]   oh, actually, the gold standard was bad.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.900]   And this is the really pernicious thing about it is,
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.500]   the problems that were caused by us
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.340]   going off the gold standard,
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.020]   were caused by the gold standard.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.620]   And we're going to fix them
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.820]   by going off the gold standard even more.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.900]   - Just because government is lying and it's shady
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.220]   and it does these kinds of things
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.620]   doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.100]   So just, 'cause I wanted to separate a few things you said.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.260]   It could very well be very wrong.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.020]   And they could indeed be hucksters.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.800]   All of these, such colorful language.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.660]   I love you deeply for this.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.500]   This is fun.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.300]   - Yeah, but I mean, it's not like somebody like Krugman
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.940]   doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.700]   It's just that when actors like him use it,
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.260]   it's presented as if it is legitimate
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.640]   because he's part of the major shows.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.820]   - So the case they make,
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.060]   and the criticism Keynesians make of Austrian economics,
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.700]   and the case they make for Keynesian economics
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.140]   is it's based on empirical evidence.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:32.900]   So Austrian economists are pie in the sky,
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.340]   theorists about how human nature works,
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.460]   and it's just all theory.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.660]   And just like you said,
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.100]   Keynesian economics kind of sell it as a science,
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.740]   data-driven science.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.060]   And so where's the data, bro?
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.920]   So one way of saying it is,
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.940]   how do you know if we get rid of inflation?
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.980]   How do you know if we get rid of central banks?
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.700]   If we push towards that direction,
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.020]   we will have a better world,
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.420]   a better functioning economy, better functioning markets,
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.900]   better functioning society.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.400]   - This is another inaccurate way
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.140]   in which they present the economics.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.620]   They present it as if it's just theory
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.780]   and that the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.140]   What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.420]   data is mute, data is dumb, data can't say anything.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.100]   So-- - Theory first,
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.260]   and then you have to have models.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.260]   To provide context for interpretation of the data.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.700]   - Exactly, and it's a sign
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.780]   of just how little self-awareness they have
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.260]   that they think that they're just being led by the data
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   when they're being led by Keynes' moronic theories.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.900]   And they use the data to justify those theories
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.380]   and to stick by them.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.100]   And in fact, they are the ones
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.260]   whose theories cannot be refuted
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.360]   because it's just government-mandated religion.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.060]   So according to Keynes' nonsense,
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.380]   so the way that the whole thing is,
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.660]   the way that they justify the inflationism is this,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.380]   and I'm just using this to give an example
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.580]   of what you're talking about in terms of theory.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.980]   The way they justify the inflationism,
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.780]   to tie it back to the original point,
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.100]   they justify, all right, we need money to spend,
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.140]   and then the level of spending in the economy
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.700]   is what determines the state of the economy.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.140]   And I've taught macroeconomics
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.500]   at university level for a while, so I know this.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.280]   I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.000]   know Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.200]   So the way they see it is the level of spending
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.400]   in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.720]   There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.480]   So there's like the factories on the one side
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.000]   that are churning out goods,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.800]   and those goods have a certain quantity and value,
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.680]   market value, and it's completely nonsensical, of course,
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.880]   because how can the value of the goods produced
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.720]   be different from the value of the spending?
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.060]   But let's put that aside for a second.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.480]   So the amount of spending that happens in the economy
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.160]   determines the state of the economy.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.860]   If the value of the production, which they call Y,
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.320]   is higher than the aggregate expenditure,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.320]   so this is the production,
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.460]   and then the aggregate expenditure is lower,
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.720]   then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.280]   and then that causes a recession.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.760]   The factories start laying off workers,
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.320]   and then the laid off workers start spending less,
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.560]   and then that leads to aggregate expenditure
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.320]   dropping even further, and so it's a vicious cycle
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.600]   where the economy gets into recession,
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.000]   and the only way out is for Keynes' bankster buddies
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.080]   and government buddies to print a lot of money
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.480]   to give to themselves, and then that will--
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.720]   - That's one interpretation.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.920]   But to print more money to increase the expenditure
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.360]   that to match the supply-- - To match the level of output.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.160]   - Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.000]   (Lex laughing)
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.840]   - All right.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.600]   - Even though you're saying Huckster, so--
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.440]   - Yes.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.520]   - You know, the way, I love you very much,
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.680]   but just for people who are listening,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.920]   I think it's, I love the way you talk,
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.520]   and it's great, and keep doing it,
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.920]   but just for context,
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.880]   I don't know anything that involves human nature
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.720]   deserves this level of certainty.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.320]   At least my position is that we don't know
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.240]   what the hell we're doing on basically anything.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.080]   - Perhaps, but I mean--
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.000]   - And there's a lot,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.560]   certainty can get us in trouble, is my worry.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.200]   I don't know much about economics,
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.740]   I don't even know financial systems, monetary systems,
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:35.400]   but I've just seen us get in trouble with human psychology,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   certainty, certainty of ideologies in general.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.360]   You mentioned Marxism and so on,
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.200]   I came from the Soviet Union,
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.440]   there's a lot of people that are very certain
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.600]   throughout the history of the 20th century
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.860]   that communism is the utopia,
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.560]   that humanity should strive for.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.400]   So I'm nervous around certainty.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.200]   - I could be wrong, but you ask me for my opinion.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.240]   - Yes, yes, sorry, so it's that little bit of a caveat.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.160]   - So to go back to the idea,
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.480]   then on the other hand, you have the level of,
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.120]   if the, the other situation is when the level of spending
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.000]   is higher than the amount of aggregate output.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.800]   In that situation, you have too much spending,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.600]   so therefore what ends up happening is inflation.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.160]   So according to the Keynesian worldview,
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.080]   this is really important,
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.600]   because this is a way that I'm gonna get to your point
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.000]   about empirical data and to show you why
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.560]   they're not correct.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.320]   Yeah, they're not correct about what they say
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.600]   about empirical data.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   So then what this means is that there's a level of output
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.200]   and there's a level of aggregate expenditure.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.080]   The aggregate expenditure can either be higher
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.640]   or lower than the output or equal to it.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.680]   If it's higher, we get inflation.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.640]   If it's lower, we get recessions, okay?
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.040]   So is there any universe in this model?
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.360]   Is there any potential universe in which you can have
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.300]   both inflation and a recession?
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.400]   According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.680]   Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.980]   and lower than output.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.460]   So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.480]   if you were looking at evidence and trying to be,
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.800]   trying to analyze data, you'd look at this and say,
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.760]   one example, you just need one example of high inflation
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.720]   and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.960]   And of course, the world is full of examples
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.120]   of high inflation and high unemployment.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.040]   And that's what happened in the 19, and of course,
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.240]   they ignored it and when it happens in poor countries,
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.480]   because poor countries don't really matter.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.200]   But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.260]   and in the Western economies
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.380]   and the most advanced industrial economies.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.440]   So historically, before then,
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.720]   you had all these Keynesian central bankers
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.000]   talking about this model and saying,
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.060]   well, aggregate expenditure is too low now
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.440]   and that's why we have unemployment,
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.600]   so we need to print more money.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.520]   And then they print more money, inflation goes up,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.440]   but also unemployment goes up,
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.880]   because this model is broken.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.240]   That's not how the world works.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.320]   That's not, the level of aggregate spending in the economy
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.560]   is not a lever with which you can control inflation
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.800]   and unemployment.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.880]   So what would a scientist do?
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.400]   What would a non-Huckster do in this case?
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.660]   Admit the theory is wrong
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:21.240]   and find another way to reformulate it.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.040]   Have the Keynesians done that?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.560]   No, still the same garbage in the textbook
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.120]   that is being taught until today.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.680]   - So is it possible to have a non-Keynesian model
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.360]   or one that still supports moderate amount of inflation
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.560]   is good for the economy?
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.440]   - I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened, yeah.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   This is what basically most fiat economists,
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.120]   as I like to call them,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.520]   essentially anybody at a university financed by governments,
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.400]   which is financed by central banks, which is financed--
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.600]   - I will talk about that.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.840]   - Yes. - The effect of fiat money
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.080]   on our life, as you write about in your book,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.440]   fiat standard, one of them is education.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.140]   I'm sure we'll disagree there too.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.000]   Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.200]   - So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.800]   but basically it's such an example of motivated reasoning.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.380]   Anybody who's got a familiarity with the scientific method
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.880]   or who's got an engineering background
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.560]   who comes into economics immediately has a lot of red flags.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:22.320]   And I remember when I used to teach macroeconomics,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.520]   I used to teach introductory macroeconomics,
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.580]   and it's a course that would be taken by econ majors
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.640]   as well as engineers.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.600]   A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.040]   And every time I'd explain,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.240]   and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff,
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.160]   and every time I'd explain it,
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.960]   there's always that smart engineering kid
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.000]   who just looks at me and says,
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.560]   "Sir, this doesn't make any sense
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.240]   "because this and this and that."
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.720]   And I'm always like, "You get it, exactly, you're correct."
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.560]   Because if you have any kind of shred of scientific thinking
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.200]   you see that this is all motivated reasoning.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.820]   Like the answer is government needs to print money.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.720]   And here's a whole bunch of models brought up by people
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.080]   for why government printing money is good.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.960]   And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.040]   is that you only get funded
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.320]   if you come up with this conclusion.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.720]   If you come up with a conclusion that we need to
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.280]   shut down the central bank,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.120]   you don't get funded by the central bank.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.640]   You don't get published in the journals.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.560]   You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.020]   You don't get quoted by fiat publications
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.840]   like the New York Times and CNN.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.360]   They don't invite you on as an expert.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.560]   - Well, that's a fundamental flaw
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.680]   with a lot of institutions we have today,
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.000]   and throughout human history.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.520]   Let me zoom out for just a second to the big question.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.440]   What is economics in general?
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.280]   What's the goal?
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.920]   You said there's a bunch of models.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.160]   Is any economist basically trying to throw a bunch of models
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.040]   about human behavior on the table
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.920]   and try to generalize it to the global scale
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.080]   so both dance between micro and macro somehow
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.200]   in order to determine public policy
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.080]   and explain the past, predict the future,
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.960]   prescribe policies that can control the future,
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.900]   those kinds of things?
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.160]   That's the big, basic, ridiculous question
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.080]   of what is economics.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.320]   - Economics is the study,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.360]   the way the Austrians define it is the study
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.080]   of how humans make choices under the condition of scarcity.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.000]   We begin with the starting point of economics
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.100]   is the fact that scarcity exists.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.480]   And why does scarcity exist?
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.320]   Well, because it's easier to want things
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.400]   than it is to make them.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.240]   It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.600]   And so because we have wants
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.960]   and we have limited means to meet those wants,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.200]   we need to economize.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   It's a permanent marker of the human condition.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.960]   We are always economizing at all times.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.020]   And so how people make those decisions
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.520]   under the conditions of scarcity is what economists study.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.880]   So to go back to your point on empiricism
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.320]   in Austrian school,
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.660]   so it isn't that the Austrians don't believe in data.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:00.480]   On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.440]   And in fact, if you think about it
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.660]   as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.600]   if you have stagflation,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.440]   that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.480]   The Austrian way of thinking,
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.860]   which is think from first principles,
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.880]   understand how the world actually works,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.360]   think about how humans act
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.600]   and understand that economics
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.920]   is really all about human action.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.620]   So it's not about aggregates of goods.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.480]   This is really the key distinction in terms of methodology.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.800]   For the Keynesians, it's physics envy.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.320]   They look at the market economy,
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.680]   they look at individuals in the market economy,
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.200]   and they think that they can understand the market economy
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.760]   by looking at aggregates.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.560]   This is really the key point of what I think makes
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.080]   the certain branch of economics pseudoscientific
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.800]   is the introduction of aggregates.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.480]   When you introduce those aggregates,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.440]   how much production takes place,
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.560]   how many people are unemployed,
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.560]   the percentage of the inflation rate,
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.520]   and then you think that you can establish
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.840]   scientific relationship between those aggregates,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.480]   it's purely physics envy.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.960]   In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.880]   you put, let's say, a container which contains a gas,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.360]   and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT,
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.920]   calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.760]   and then the temperature.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.600]   If you have the pressure and the volume,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   you can calculate the temperature
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.040]   because you have the nRT constants.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.720]   So there's a clear relationship
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.600]   that has been demonstrated in a laboratory,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   and that we can do it right now.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.240]   We can measure it, and we can see it,
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.040]   and it continues to hold.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.760]   And all it takes is one scientist
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.800]   to show that this relationship does not hold,
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.000]   to do an experiment that shows this does not hold,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   and it stops being a law of chemistry, and it's broken.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.400]   Whereas in economics, what they've done
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.200]   is they've copied the superficial shape of this
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.860]   without any of the scientific rigor
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.840]   that was used to build it.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.880]   There's no experiments.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.120]   You can't experiment on economies.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.760]   We don't have the ability to establish laws,
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.360]   and all the laws that we establish
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.400]   are just models that get people published
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.160]   and get them on the media to say,
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.560]   my model says we need to print more money,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.440]   but it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.600]   If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.200]   because the world is full of examples that contradict them.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.200]   - Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.080]   when it's human nature, when you can't,
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.640]   when there's a nearly infinite number of variables
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.000]   and you can't control them?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.840]   Is it possible?
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.180]   So what's the best thing you could possibly do?
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.180]   - You do thought experiments.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.920]   - But the problem with thought experiments,
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.800]   you know, Freud thinks everybody wants
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.840]   to have sex with their mother.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.680]   Is he right? - That's the problem
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.800]   with Freud.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   - I don't know, maybe he's right.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.000]   Well, obviously, I'm joking on that front, but the--
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.040]   - Freud is probably under the canes.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.680]   - Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.440]   Just like Einstein, you know, a lot of general relativity,
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.280]   special relativity, that's a thought experiment.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.880]   It originates in a thought experiment.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.080]   Now, is it true?
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.680]   You know, nice thing about physics,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.440]   you can eventually have experimental validation.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.880]   The downside of economics is you really can't have
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.640]   experimental, like definitive experimental scientific rigor
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.080]   of validation of a theory.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.160]   So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.760]   Using your intuition, it's the power of reasoning together
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.680]   about human nature.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.520]   - And that's why economics cannot make the claims
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.360]   that physics can make.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.720]   So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.320]   at this pressure, at this volume,
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.000]   the temperature will be that much.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.320]   And you can make that prediction
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.840]   and test it a million times
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.360]   and you'll always get the precisely correct answer.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.080]   With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.880]   - On Twitter, and even today,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.680]   you're very certain about the statements you're making.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.520]   Do you--
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.480]   - Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.320]   That's the thing.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.360]   In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.120]   We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.640]   But we can understand how the world actually works
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.480]   with humility.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.660]   This is really the key difference,
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.960]   that the Keynesians think they just wanna copy
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.280]   the methods of physics, and then that's just, you know,
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.400]   gonna give them the certainty of the results of physics,
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.040]   which is like me saying I'm just gonna put a red blanket
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.840]   on my back and jump from the fourth floor
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.160]   because I'm Superman.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.480]   Well, it's not the red blanket
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.000]   that's gonna make me Superman.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.160]   There's a lot more to it.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.480]   So humility manifests itself in economics
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.600]   as the belief in a free market,
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.380]   meaning like I can't centralize,
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.160]   I can't do centralized control on this thing.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.480]   We're going to minimize the friction
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.440]   of the free exchange of goods.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.280]   - So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.640]   - Yes, and you can arrive at it through two paths.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.900]   The more practical path,
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.080]   which most scientific-minded people arrive at.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.520]   You know, I came from an engineering background,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.020]   so I initially had this idea
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.180]   that what is lacking in economics is mathematization.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.260]   We need to have better math models.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.120]   We need to get all of those tools from engineering,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.160]   apply them to economics,
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.100]   and then we'll be able to plan the world economy
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.320]   and make it work better.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.880]   And then you start actually trying to solve problems,
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.320]   you know, trying to actually calculate them.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.720]   And you realize nobody can have that ability
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.480]   because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.780]   we can't have experiments.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.080]   And the reason we can't have experiments
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.900]   is that you can experiment on particles of a gas.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.440]   You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.160]   And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.000]   And so, you know, you kick matter in a certain way,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.800]   you can calculate exactly how much it's going to fly.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.360]   Human beings are much more complex.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.680]   They have a will inside them.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.400]   And this is really, this is the humility to understand
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.560]   that you are a human being
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.400]   and other people are also human being just like you.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.600]   And that the, you know, every person wakes up every morning
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.400]   and they have a million things in their mind,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.680]   a million things they care about,
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.480]   a million things they wanna do.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.220]   And you will never be able to make the decisions
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.680]   for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.000]   So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.020]   that free markets are better
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.760]   because you've realized that all of the people
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.680]   that think that they can centrally plan markets
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.900]   can't actually do that.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.560]   And that there's really nothing scientific about them
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.160]   except essentially the rituals they ape
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.300]   of the scientific process.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.140]   And the other path I think that makes you arrive
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.200]   at the Austrian perspective
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.420]   or the libertarian perspective I should say
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.000]   is simply the notion of individuals
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.700]   as having their own inalienable right
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.800]   to decide what they want to do with themselves.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.700]   If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.280]   the idea that you get to be planner
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.520]   is ultimately you think you're better than other people.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.800]   You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.080]   And I don't think that's a defensible position.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.640]   I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.500]   I will never want to force anybody
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.840]   to do anything they don't want.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.960]   The Keynesian perspective,
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.320]   the central planning perspective is unlike physics,
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.240]   which is let's force a bunch of particles
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.120]   to sit in a lab so that we can study them.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.520]   In economics, you're forcing people to do things.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.120]   Let's stop these people from doing this job
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.400]   because it's bad for the economy
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.060]   and let's get them to do that job.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.720]   Let's force them to pay this price.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.520]   Let's tax them this much.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.480]   Let's prevent them from using gold as money
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.280]   and force them to use our credit as money.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.560]   So it has to rely on coercion.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.640]   There's no central planning without coercion.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.200]   And coercion is a crime in my opinion.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.760]   There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.260]   - So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:58.720]   your view is the, I mean, perhaps the broadly speaking
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.720]   the libertarian view is coercion is unethical.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.340]   Freedom is essential.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.360]   What are the pros and cons of government intervention
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]   in the economy?
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.880]   So can you steal, can you provide pros?
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.260]   You just kind of provided arguments against.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.880]   Is there any arguments to be made
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.580]   for government intervention,
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.240]   for the role of government in society?
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.640]   Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.440]   what is a positive role of government
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.480]   that you can imagine you can speak to?
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.920]   - I can repeat many other cases,
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.040]   but I don't find any of them compelling
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.080]   for the reason that I mentioned,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.480]   which is that ultimately they all rely
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.520]   on putting a gun to somebody's head
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.800]   and using the threat of force.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.080]   So that's for me is can never be justifiable.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.680]   Whatever the ends are, if the means are violence
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.080]   and the threat of violence, then the ends aren't justified.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.360]   Everything that's good, governments will use as an excuse
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.880]   to justify coercion.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.480]   So, you know, what are you like?
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.040]   You like motherhood and apple pie.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.040]   Well, government needs to ensure that motherhood works well
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.520]   and we need government central planning of birth.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.400]   We need regulations on birth, for instance.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.480]   We need regulations on how people give birth.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.160]   We need to ban people from giving birth
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.120]   in traditional ways that have been tried
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:18.960]   for thousands of years.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.980]   We need to force people to do things
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.840]   in the modern scientific way.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.520]   - Well, so what about things like that all of us use,
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   so infrastructure, for example, or education,
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.540]   or well, the economy too, right?
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.480]   Can you make a case for the role
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.120]   of some large-scale centralized systems,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.600]   whether it's government or not,
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.360]   that do this kind of management?
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.720]   - I guess perhaps you could say
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.840]   there's the economies of scale argument
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.280]   that some things must exist at a very large scale
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.840]   and therefore you would want political accountability
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.100]   of the people who manage them.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.520]   This is kind of the argument that's given
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.440]   for infrastructure monopolies, you know,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.680]   for instance, roads or electricity.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.080]   That, let's say we live in a country,
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.200]   we need one power plant.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.160]   The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be,
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.000]   and there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.160]   so we're gonna have to have one power plant,
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.360]   and since it's only one power plant,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.080]   then we can't just let anybody own it
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.380]   because then they're gonna make it too expensive,
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.240]   so we need to have the government own it
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.200]   so it can make it too expensive.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.920]   - And you don't find that case compelling?
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.740]   - Not at all.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.580]   I used to believe in it.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.600]   I was pretty much a Keynesian
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.360]   when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia,
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.160]   and no, I don't find that compelling at all
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.700]   because I think all these examples that they mention
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.540]   of natural monopolies or economies of scale
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.640]   that can only fit at a scale of government,
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.520]   it's always, you know, government bans people
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.400]   from opening power plants,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.120]   and then there's only one power plant
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.160]   and they need to be in charge of it,
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.440]   but in reality, no, in reality,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.640]   you know, power plants can exist
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.400]   at all kinds of manners of scales of operation,
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.840]   and yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.280]   in power plants in particular
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.520]   because there's efficiency in generation.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.080]   You know, one big power plant is more efficient
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.000]   than 10 equivalent smaller power plants,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.260]   but there's also inefficiencies in centralization
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.520]   because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.920]   the further away a lot of the population is going to be,
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.960]   so you're gonna be losing a lot of the electricity
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.560]   and transmission.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.240]   - And you believe the free market is best
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.920]   in managing that dance,
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.240]   that balance of centralization. - Exactly.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.560]   Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.360]   where there's one power plant for an area,
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.480]   then, you know, if the markets ends up centralizing
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.440]   all of it into one power plant,
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.760]   I don't see that as a problem.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.040]   There are places, you know,
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.080]   there's a small town with only one barbershop.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.480]   Is that a catastrophe?
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.920]   No, because they don't need two barbershops.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.520]   Now, if that barbershop started to take advantage of people,
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.400]   started to charge higher price,
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.000]   well, then that's just an opportunity for others to step in
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.040]   and put them in their place,
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.440]   and that's the same thing with power plants.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.600]   It's the same thing with everything.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.320]   Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.160]   From the central planning perspective,
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.720]   they'll present you the problem as it is,
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.600]   and they'll tell you, well, this is bad,
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.120]   so the fix, you know, and what we can do is better,
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.880]   so let's stop what's bad and do what is better.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.720]   Two problems here.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.600]   Usually, the reason that the thing is bad in the first place
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.080]   is because it is a government monopoly,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.120]   is because of government intervention,
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.960]   but the second thing is that this notion
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.120]   that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.680]   and make it better,
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.720]   is it ignores the fundamental underlying reality,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.840]   which is that what you're doing is
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.480]   you're offering only one way for this problem to be solved
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.320]   and making all other solutions practically illegal.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.120]   You're taking taxpayer money,
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.920]   you're putting guns to people's heads to take their money,
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.040]   to use it to build, say, this one solution for a power plant,
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.440]   but you're preventing the free market process
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.280]   from providing us with other alternatives.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.640]   - Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:18.440]   but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.800]   for the solution that you propose and enforce by,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.800]   as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.120]   You're accountable for that choice,
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.600]   for the quality of that solution by being voted out
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.680]   if the solution is actually bad.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.320]   So it's just a different selection mechanism.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.800]   And I think, I personally believe
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.520]   it is a selection mechanism that has worked in the past.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.520]   It just often does not work nearly as well as a free market.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.000]   And the question is, are there domains
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.760]   in which the free market gets itself into trouble?
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.040]   So this theoretical view is that
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   that's the point of a free market,
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.080]   is it doesn't, if there's trouble, that's a signal,
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.800]   and it will respond to that signal,
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.880]   and it will respond appropriately
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.360]   to make you try to maximize happiness.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.480]   The question is, is there a local optima
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.640]   that free markets get stuck in and you need governments
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.080]   to represent the broader scale of the people
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.520]   to get outside of that?
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.160]   - I think the fundamental problem here
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:26.120]   is the idea that there is a feedback mechanism
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.960]   when there is coercion in one party,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.760]   when one party can employ coercion and the other one cannot.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.840]   So in other words, I'm gonna put a gun to your head,
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.280]   I'm gonna take your money,
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.680]   and I'm gonna use it to buy more guns
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.960]   for me to put against your head,
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.000]   but somehow you're gonna put a paper in a box
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.960]   and that's going to deactivate my guns.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.040]   - Well, love requires a push and pull,
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.360]   a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.400]   I think-- - Yeah, I mean--
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.320]   - A little gun to the head,
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.560]   and that's sometimes-- - Good luck to anybody
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.120]   who's gonna be dating you if you think
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.200]   putting a gun to people's head
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.860]   is comparable to a relationship.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:02.720]   - All jokes, but yes, I mean,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   people don't often think of it as government
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.440]   and the military as gun to the head,
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.720]   but that is sort of a libertarian perspective
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.760]   because ultimately when you, you know,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.720]   turtles all the way down and at the bottom there's guns.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.120]   - Yeah, so-- - At the bottom,
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.320]   if you don't wanna pay, if you don't wanna,
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   you know, all right, I don't wanna be part
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.320]   of your power plant, I wanna get my own generator,
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.720]   I don't wanna do it, and I don't wanna pay for it,
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.580]   you go to jail, you can't not pay for it.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.600]   That's really the asymmetry which the market doesn't have,
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.960]   which is why, in my opinion, it's not as if, you know,
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.200]   I'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.400]   that I want a market and that the government can't work.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.480]   It's presented as if, you know,
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.720]   we're choosing between two different machines,
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.800]   you know, should we use an Apple or a PC,
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.560]   and I'm just constantly choosing one of them
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.480]   and saying that the other one can't work.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.320]   It's not equivalent, it's not two machines.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.600]   We're comparing between a machine and a gun to the head.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.440]   We're comparing between a situation in which anybody,
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.640]   anywhere is free to provide the service or the good,
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.960]   and anybody anywhere is free to buy it from them
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.760]   or reject to buy it from them.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.680]   So anyone can build a power plant,
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.040]   anyone can succeed at it, anybody can fail at it,
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.440]   anybody can build it in a way that I can choose
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.800]   to take part in or not take part in.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.080]   I can build my own.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.240]   So we have a situation in which 10 million people,
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.760]   let's say, they each can freely choose
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.400]   to provide the good or to buy the good.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.920]   That cannot be considered an alternative on an equal footing
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.920]   to a situation where one person or one entity
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.680]   gets to decide for everybody
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.040]   and those who disagree go to jail.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.720]   So the problem is that the alternative to governments
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.640]   is other large successful entities that have humans in them
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.000]   and human nature is such that there's corruption,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   manipulation, and so on.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   I think free market depends on the honest communication
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.840]   of information as widely as possible
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.440]   so people can make great rational decisions.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.040]   But sort of my fear is that like to propose
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.000]   is that in general there's manipulation,
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.080]   whether it's government, whether it's companies.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.320]   They're going to manipulate,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.000]   they're going to try to do propaganda,
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.360]   they're going to try to manipulate you.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.880]   Deceive you, shut down competition by playing games,
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.560]   human games of different kinds.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.320]   And sometimes even meaning well.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.080]   It's not like everybody thinks they're doing good
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.560]   and they're actually doing evil.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.440]   So how do we prevent the worst of human nature coming out
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.960]   in a free market as well?
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.480]   - By not giving the worst of human nature
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.680]   a monopoly on violence in the institution of government.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.880]   - That little inkling of coercion,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.040]   that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.880]   like ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.640]   - Yes, and it ends up just being the place
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.120]   where corporations, individuals, free markets,
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.760]   they can't coerce without the resort to government.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.400]   So you think about all the examples
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.680]   of corrupt corporations doing bad things.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.380]   It's always because they have certain privileges
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:10.040]   from governments because as it exists,
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   Coca-Cola, McDonald's, all of these giant corporations,
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.820]   they can't do anything to me without government.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.100]   They can't take any of my money
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.240]   and they can't force me to buy their stuff.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.400]   And so it doesn't matter to me.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.000]   So if Coca-Cola is corrupted,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.800]   that's a problem for Coca-Cola customers,
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.920]   that's a problem for Coca-Cola shareholders,
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   that's a problem for anybody who deals with Coca-Cola.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.440]   But as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.360]   and isn't a shareholder,
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.520]   I have absolutely no interest in what happens.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:39.000]   They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.200]   I don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.200]   So in this situation where you choose
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.760]   to voluntarily associate with people
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.560]   and you only give your money to people
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.440]   you want to voluntarily give the money to,
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.280]   so you either buy their product
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.880]   or invest in their production,
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.760]   in that situation, the only way that a company
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.920]   can get my money is if they build a product
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.000]   that I value or if they convince me
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.640]   that they are going to use it in a way that's profitable.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.680]   And I may be wrong, I may invest in a company that fails
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.280]   or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.480]   but that's my fault.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.720]   It's my fault that I gave them my money
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.840]   and then it turned out to be scoundrels.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.960]   But it's a totally different problem
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.240]   when we make it mandatory.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.080]   It's violence, it's a crime to put a gun to my head
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.520]   and force me to subsidize companies
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.280]   and force me to come at certain conclusions.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.160]   - Do you find an interesting distinction,
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.720]   mentioned by Kamalis, between anarchism and libertarianism?
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.800]   So this particular use of violence,
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.680]   this like last resort, this policing force
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.200]   that libertarianism is okay with
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.720]   and anarchism is not okay with.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.480]   So basically nation states that keep you safe
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.320]   from the worst of war.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.560]   - Yeah, I think to be more accurate,
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.040]   the distinction is between anarchism and minarchism.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.640]   I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.360]   that can encompass both.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.400]   - Means a lot of things, okay.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.520]   - Yeah, but--
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:19.880]   - On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum,
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.720]   where do you--
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.160]   - No, no, I'm full anarchist.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.000]   - You're a full anarchist.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.840]   - Yeah, full anarchist.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.720]   I mean, I don't find any justification for the use of force
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.680]   and I think recently perhaps, maybe I'm getting old,
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.120]   maybe I'm getting senile, maybe I'm getting wise,
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.480]   who knows, but I'm beginning to become
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.640]   more sympathetic to monarchy.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.760]   So I'm an anarchist--
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.600]   - Which, what?
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.440]   - Monarchy.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   - Which, what is that?
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.280]   - Kings.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.120]   - Oh, monarchy.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.940]   - Yeah.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.240]   (laughing)
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.080]   And I think--
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.840]   - Wait, can you, are you joking or not?
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.120]   - No, I'm not joking.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.000]   And I think, I mean, I think, you know,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.320]   morally and intellectually, I'm an anarchist,
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.360]   but it's, the reality is we find ourselves
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.560]   in a world in which a lot of people are not.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.360]   And the question is, what is the thing
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.760]   that is going to provide you with more freedom?
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.740]   And I think, I'm recently coming around to the idea
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:21.040]   that monarchy might be the best way to provide people
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.080]   with the largest amount of freedom
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.840]   because to have a free society,
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.060]   you need a majority perhaps or a plurality of people
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.880]   to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.120]   to have a low time preference,
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.720]   to have a preference for the future.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.480]   So you need a majority of the population
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:41.280]   to not decide to go and do something insane
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.400]   in order to continue to have a free society.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.040]   You know, when a respiratory illness comes along,
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.120]   unfortunately, you know, the last couple of years
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.640]   showed that we, the vast majority of people
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.320]   are gonna freak out and lose their mind
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.480]   and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.560]   And, you know, there's always a current thing
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.840]   and the media is always telling you
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.760]   that we need this current thing
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.240]   as an excuse for more and more government power
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.640]   and more and more government coercion.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.080]   - What's the role of kings and queens
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.200]   in that case of a monarchy?
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.720]   - The situation-- - What's the role of a leader?
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.720]   - I think there might be a case that,
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.340]   so as I was saying, you need a majority of the population
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:28.320]   to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case,
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.500]   you know, the answer is voluntary.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:34.120]   No matter how bad the disease is,
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.320]   it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.520]   You wanna stay home, stay home.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.600]   You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine, do whatever you want,
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.460]   but you can't force others to do that.
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.920]   So you need a majority of the people
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.440]   to strongly believe in this principle
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.380]   in order to get it in a democracy.
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:54.440]   Whereas in a monarchy, you just need the king to get it.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.400]   And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.000]   is that kings have a low time preference
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.520]   where they think about things for many generations,
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.440]   whereas in a democratic system,
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.240]   your president is likely only going to be there
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.640]   for four years or eight years or 10 years
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.600]   or five years or whatever it is.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.560]   So the only way that, you know,
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.920]   all humans are self-interested.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.940]   So the only way that your president in a democracy
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:19.840]   can provide for themselves
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.440]   is to maximize the amount of exploitation
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.120]   that they can do of the population
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.400]   during their brief stint.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.680]   And then when he's out, you get a new one
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.520]   and then that one wants to start all over again.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.040]   So every four years you get a new robber.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.040]   With monarchy, you sign up for a multi-generational
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.360]   subscription to the same family.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.160]   And when they have the security of knowing that,
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.560]   you know, his great grandson is going to be taking money
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.860]   from your great grandson,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:54.360]   suddenly his interest in yours align
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.800]   because they both want your great grandson to be prosperous
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.880]   and have enough money for his great grandson to take.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.320]   - So it's a monarchy with a tiny government.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   So anything required to really provide for a free market.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.000]   So for maximizing individual freedom
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.440]   and the freedom of the economy.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.720]   - Yeah, and if I were king,
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.080]   which is highly unlikely to ever happen,
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.240]   but I think, you know, if you look historically,
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.120]   the dynasties that have succeeded
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.160]   at lasting for a long time,
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.920]   the key thing that they managed to do
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.900]   is to basically be libertarian.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.760]   The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone,
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.160]   let them do whatever they want,
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.200]   don't rob them too much or rob them as little as possible,
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.100]   or maybe even don't rob them.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.520]   And, you know, as a king, use your power only
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.160]   to punish people who aggress against others.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.840]   Don't use your power to enrich yourself
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.280]   and enrich your friends.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.680]   And that's really, like, if you look at smart kings,
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   this is what they do, this is what they teach their children
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.120]   and the cycle of kingdoms is that, you know,
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.500]   the first king understands this, builds the empire,
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.680]   and the first couple of generations,
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.620]   they get this and the society is free, the economy is free.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.240]   And because of that, you know,
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:10.720]   there's peace and prosperity, but then over time,
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.400]   the next generation of kids
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.720]   become a lot more high time preference.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.240]   They haven't worked hard,
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.940]   they don't understand the meaning of hard work,
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.880]   so they become more likely to engage in destructive behavior.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   So raise taxes, pass laws that require people to do things,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.800]   even when they're not hurting anybody.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.840]   And that ends up basically eventually destroying the kingdom.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.000]   - Of course, power corrupts.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.080]   - Yeah. - So you have to kind of
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.960]   create human institutions that prevent you as a king
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.280]   or any kind of leader from expanding.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.120]   So going back on the original promises
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.280]   and the purposes of your position.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.240]   - Yeah. - And then distracting,
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.760]   using tools of technology and communication
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.240]   to distract the populace while you expand the power.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.320]   - Exactly. - All right.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.720]   You wrote the fiat standard.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.520]   I think we danced around it quite a bit,
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.120]   but I don't know if we actually defined it.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.800]   So what is fiat money?
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.620]   What is the history of how it came to be?
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.060]   - The fascinating history of the birth
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.400]   of the fiat monetary system is something
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.640]   that really only got uncovered in 2017.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.040]   This is extremely, extremely interesting.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.620]   In 1914, Britain joined World War I.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.680]   And if you remember your history books,
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.280]   it's famous that this was called the August Bank Holiday.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.720]   It was just going to be a few weeks
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.280]   where the British troops were gonna go
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.720]   and kick European ass and come back triumphant.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.020]   And most European countries believed that.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.360]   But then the war kept on dragging on.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.320]   And of course, to finance the war,
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.920]   the government, this is what they used to do
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.920]   under the gold standard, governments would issue bonds.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.600]   So you'd issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds,
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.920]   the money would be used to finance the military,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.640]   and then the government would pay off the bond
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.960]   over the next five or 10 or 20 years.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.200]   So for World War I, the British government,
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.160]   the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.360]   And this only came to light in 2017.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.780]   Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.180]   So people, British people,
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.100]   and this is perhaps the greatest thing
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.260]   that they've ever done,
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.180]   they decided fighting a war in Europe
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:25.220]   is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.060]   It's a stupid thing.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.220]   Why should I go and fight?
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:30.100]   Because the Austrians and the Germans and the Serbians
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:34.140]   are at each other's throats.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.100]   I'd rather invest in something else.
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:38.860]   So they only bought a third of the bond issue.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.060]   And then the astonishing thing that happened,
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.100]   which really set the tone for the next century
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:49.060]   of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation,
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.660]   was that the Bank of England went and got
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.620]   two of the high-ranking officials in the Bank of England
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.220]   to buy the other remaining outstanding two-third of the bonds
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.500]   under their own name,
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.140]   with a line of credit from the Bank of England.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.660]   So it wasn't their own money,
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.620]   but they took money essentially from the Bank of England,
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.340]   bought two-thirds of the bonds that financed the war.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:12.620]   And that was how England was able
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.820]   to keep going into the war.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.060]   So that's essentially what they did
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:20.100]   is what we today know as quantitative easing.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.860]   Back then, they just got,
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.460]   they printed money from the Bank of England,
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.140]   or credit, printed credit,
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.940]   gave it to those two employees.
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:29.940]   They bought the bonds.
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.340]   The government could fight the war.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.460]   Sounds like it's a nice idea.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:38.100]   And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:41.340]   he himself said this was,
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.860]   he wrote a letter to the Bank of England
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.980]   that was uncovered recently,
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.780]   and he said, "I congratulate you
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.020]   "on this masterly manipulation."
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.380]   I quote it in the book.
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:51.660]   Masterly manipulation is what he called it,
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:54.700]   that they basically managed to buy the bonds
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.380]   using the money of the government.
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:59.980]   And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works,
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.580]   because he never could ask the question of,
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.740]   okay, and then what?
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.340]   All right, so we just printed money
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.300]   to buy two-thirds of these government bonds.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.020]   What's gonna happen next?
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:10.380]   What could go wrong?
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:12.940]   Not a question Keynesians ask themselves,
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:16.740]   because their jobs depend on not thinking
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.300]   about what's going to go wrong.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.660]   - So a quick question about war,
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.660]   and as somebody who's been nonstop reading
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.700]   and thinking about the wars of the 20th century,
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:31.660]   and thinking that most of those wars
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.500]   were unjust, unethical, and destructive,
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:40.140]   how else do you find, how would you finance a war?
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.940]   So-- - Ideally, you don't.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.460]   No, but I mean, of course, there are sometimes,
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.140]   you know, you wanna fight for self-defense,
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:48.540]   yeah, you finance it, taxation or bonds.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:51.140]   - So the people really need to want a war,
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.020]   not just with their voices, their thoughts,
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.780]   their tweets, or their actual financial investment.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.260]   - Put up the bullets, and the cost of the bullets,
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.420]   and the bodies.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:03.660]   - So their life and their financial well-being.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:07.460]   That's how it was under the gold standard, mostly,
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:09.260]   because under the gold standard,
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.660]   the government couldn't print gold.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.060]   And so they had a budget,
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.500]   and they had a certain amount of gold,
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.020]   and that wasn't just, you know,
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.860]   that they couldn't infinitely increase it.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:20.220]   They couldn't tax their population at will,
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.900]   and it's very difficult to take money from people.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.620]   You know, you go knock on doors and search everybody's home,
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.300]   see where they're hiding their gold.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.620]   It's very complicated.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.220]   On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.220]   which is what the case was in 1914,
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.220]   you could take their wealth just by printing the money.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:38.780]   And that's what changed everything when it comes to war.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:41.980]   That's why the 20th century was the century of total war,
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.220]   because under the gold standard,
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.420]   governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.700]   Under the fiat standard, with paper money,
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.900]   with credit money, governments fought
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.460]   until they ran out of liquid wealth
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.860]   in the hands of all of their citizens.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:33:00.860]   - So let's find flaws in this thinking, if there's any.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:06.460]   Okay, there's a lot of pacifist type of thinking
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.020]   in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:14.620]   Hitler framed himself as a victim of the past, of history.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.580]   He never attacked anybody.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.940]   Everyone's always threatening to attack him.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:21.580]   That's kind of the narrative, and he keeps expanding.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.660]   He keeps, we're talking with this charisma,
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.940]   all the countries around him,
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.820]   into sort of embracing pacifism.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:31.820]   Stay out of the war until the war's on your doorstep.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   So France, just very suboptimal military strategy
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.940]   from the perspective of many European nations
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.860]   in response to Hitler.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.620]   They were basically hoodwinked by his words.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:50.220]   So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill,
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:55.220]   who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.880]   from some kind of economics perspective,
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.900]   saying we're not going to back down.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.540]   We're going to fight Germany.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.220]   And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.140]   that Hitler failed in his expansion.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:13.560]   That decision to fight back,
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:18.780]   what's the right way to do that?
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.400]   If you're Winston Churchill,
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.020]   what's the right way to do that?
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.420]   To fight back evil when violence is required.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:35.420]   Now, you could argue that no war is just,
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.840]   but there is such a thing as a just war index,
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.920]   and a lot of people argue if there is a just war
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.880]   in the 20th century, it's World War II.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.800]   So how would you fund, if you were Britain, the war?
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.200]   Would you require Winston Churchill
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.560]   to convince the populace,
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.480]   like don't fight until they're fully convinced
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.100]   that this is the right thing to do.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.200]   You can't just make a decision for them.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.900]   You have to convince them fully
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.340]   so that they give their life
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.720]   and they give their money to support the war.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.700]   Is that the right way to do it?
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.540]   - I think so.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:13.240]   And I think when you have a true threat
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.720]   and a true evil and a true force
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.280]   that people really do think is genuine,
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.340]   you don't need to convince them.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.720]   I mean, when it's real, people will want to fight
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.380]   and people will want to pay to fight.
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.860]   And I mean, I think though on this particular example,
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.700]   I think the best way to fight Hitler
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.540]   is to have not fought World War I
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.060]   and not take out the Kaiser of Germany.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.300]   If Britain hadn't,
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.100]   and Britain and the US had not gotten involved
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:44.560]   in World War I, which really is the senseless war
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.580]   about nothing, like what was in it
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.580]   and what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:52.360]   If you look at it, after World War I,
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.080]   there were very minor adjustments in the borders
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.660]   of the countries that were participating.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.840]   So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.340]   but really it wasn't all that massive.
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:09.300]   And it wasn't like Britain wanted to take over Germany
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:12.020]   and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:17.020]   So there was no real value from that war.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.100]   And that's why the British people
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.980]   didn't want to take part in it.
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.760]   And that's why if they hadn't done
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.560]   this enormously criminal manipulation
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.520]   of printing money to buy the bonds,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.720]   Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.520]   Germany would still be a kingdom and Hitler wouldn't rise.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.240]   And yeah, there'd be small changes
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.440]   in the borders of various European countries.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.800]   I struggle to see how it could have been worse.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.880]   I mean, I struggle to see who benefited
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.800]   from four years of carnage in Europe.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.620]   And this came at the height of civilization.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:58.620]   Before that, the people of Europe had the golden era,
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.180]   100th gold standard.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.220]   They were trading with one another,
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:04.400]   they traveled and technology was advancing.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.760]   And they did not expect this war to last this long.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.360]   And my favorite story from World War I
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.840]   is the Christmas truce football game,
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.480]   which I mentioned in my book.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.640]   British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.720]   they stopped on Christmas day
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:23.120]   and they played a football game against each other.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.080]   I mean, this is not a real war
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.720]   where it's a war for survival.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.340]   Britain didn't want to end Germany.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.840]   Germany didn't want to end Britain.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.920]   It was just kings who were emboldened
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.440]   by the fact that they had a printing press
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.280]   playing with the lives of the people.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.640]   And take that away, take away the printing press,
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.360]   take away their ability to print money.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.880]   I think we'd have had a much, much,
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.960]   much better 20th century.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.520]   - Yeah, the counterfactual history,
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.080]   Neil Ferguson is a historian
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.060]   who gets in quite a bit of trouble.
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:00.240]   Basically, well, he's a Brit,
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.440]   suggesting that if Britain stayed out of World War I,
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.000]   there would be no Hitler, there would be no World War II.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.520]   - Yep, I agree entirely.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.640]   - But fiat money.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.280]   - Yeah, so how fiat money was born.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.560]   Yeah, let's get back to that.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:16.160]   So they financed the war with that money.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.000]   So what could go wrong?
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.260]   That's where we left off.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.320]   Well, what could go wrong when you've just printed
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   an enormous amount of credit and used it to buy bonds?
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.600]   What goes wrong is that the value of the currency
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.880]   is going to go down, or in other words,
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.920]   prices of things are gonna go up.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.280]   So during the war, prices keep going up.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.080]   And this is, of course,
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.240]   it's gonna sound very familiar
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.600]   to victims of the 20th century.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.440]   A government tells you it's because of the war,
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.280]   it's not our fault, it's because of the Germans,
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.160]   it's because of the foreigners, it's because of Putin,
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160]   it's because of this, it's because of that.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.320]   This has always been the case.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.120]   There's always, war is a very good cover for inflation,
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.920]   which is caused by monetary phenomena.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.300]   So then the war ends, and inflation,
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.800]   prices have more than doubled over the past four years,
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.680]   over the four years of World War I,
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.460]   prices have more than doubled.
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.840]   And then the British economy is in bad trouble.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.440]   Obviously, lost a lot of the labor force for four years
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.360]   that was out there fighting.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.960]   Now those workers come back,
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.160]   prices are up, and so people are requiring,
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.360]   are demanding that the government control prices,
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.080]   and the government is trying to fix the problem of inflation
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.920]   by doing price controls, which is what they always do,
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.120]   which is catastrophic because it makes things worse.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:38.440]   When you implement price controls,
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.640]   you say, all right, well, bread can't be sold
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.440]   for more than X price.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.240]   Well, that's just preventing bread producers
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.960]   from producing a lot of bread,
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.600]   and that's just making the problem worse.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.200]   If you let the price rise, the extra price,
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.880]   first of all, it makes people economize,
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.800]   so people will only buy what they need,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.840]   and it provides the money for the bread producers
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.640]   to acquire the capital and the resources they need
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.880]   to produce more bread,
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.520]   which then brings the price of bread down,
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.520]   but price controls destroy that.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.680]   Then they also implement wage controls,
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.200]   so you wanna also make sure that people have high wages.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.120]   So you raise people's wages artificially,
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.640]   you lower prices artificially,
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.280]   and you cause an economic problem.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.000]   And this is basically, I use this historical example
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.720]   because it's the birth of fiat,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.600]   because the Bank of England was the most important
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.640]   monetary system in the world at that time,
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.600]   and because it's the prototype
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.160]   that basically the entire planet copied
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.240]   over the last 100 years.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.160]   We've had this same thing happen.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.320]   The government prints money because of a stupid reason,
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.080]   because somebody in power decided this was worth
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.240]   destroying everybody's livelihood and savings for,
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.640]   and then the consequences come in,
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.880]   and then they start covering up
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.680]   with price controls, wage controls,
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.800]   and then that makes things worse.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.520]   And then they, and of course, throughout all of that,
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.880]   they're promising that we're going to go,
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.280]   oh, and oh, so the other thing that they did,
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.120]   which I mentioned in the chapter is,
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.360]   they stopped people from using physical gold,
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.520]   and they confiscated the, well, they didn't confiscate it,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.640]   but they took the physical gold
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.080]   and they gave people paper.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.240]   So I call it the fiat white paper.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.000]   You know, in Bitcoin, we have the white paper.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.400]   The fiat white paper was that the Bank of England
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.040]   announced to all of its banks and post offices
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.240]   that from now on, you should not make payment in gold,
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.960]   and you should take payment in gold,
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.360]   and you should encourage all your customers
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.680]   to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.080]   - Is there an actual document?
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.920]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.760]   - Nice.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.440]   - Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.400]   Obviously, nobody really likes to talk about this stuff
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.960]   because, you know, they're fiat economists,
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.200]   so they don't wanna talk about the original sin, but-
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.920]   - Well, you should like republish it
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.160]   as the fiat white paper or something like that.
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.800]   (both laugh)
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.720]   - There's a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.160]   So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.840]   He was the chief of the Bank of England.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.640]   He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne,
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.560]   to study what the bank did during World War I,
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.600]   and it was a study that was kept under wraps,
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.720]   confidential, in the Bank of England,
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.160]   only released in 2017, almost a century later.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.000]   And-
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.040]   - What was special about 2017, by the way?
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:15.880]   It's a year.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.240]   It's just that it was a year on which
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.840]   some of this information was released.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.320]   - Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.360]   of the Bank of England and found this and published it,
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.160]   and now you can download it as a PDF
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.520]   and find all of the amazing details.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.480]   So they confiscated the gold,
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.960]   and they forced people to use the paper,
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.560]   and they promised people that as soon as the war
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.320]   is gonna be over, this is temporary,
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.200]   we're gonna be back to using gold.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:41.680]   And of course, if you told people in Britain,
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.880]   this is the real scam about fiat.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.920]   If you told people in Britain in 1914,
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.960]   "Hey, we're gonna go off the gold standard
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.960]   "because it's better," I mean,
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.600]   there might have been lynchings of government officials
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.720]   because the British pound at that point,
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:01.560]   it had been the global currency of the whole world,
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.720]   and the fact that they'd managed,
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.040]   the Bank of England had kept the British pound
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.840]   at a fixed rate next to gold for,
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:12.040]   since Newton, the exchange rate,
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.960]   the value of the British pound
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.360]   was set by Isaac Newton himself.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.520]   He was the warden of the mint,
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.080]   and he made the pound a specific amount of gold,
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.680]   and since then, up until World War I,
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.520]   it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.400]   I think I might be wrong, but I have it in the book.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:32.680]   So he'd set that price,
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.160]   and it was a matter of national pride
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.880]   for people in England.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.520]   The sterling is as good as gold
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.280]   because for two centuries, it has been stuck to gold.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.360]   There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.160]   but for two centuries, mostly it was stuck to that.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.080]   And so they went off that, and then they couldn't go back
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.200]   because if they wanted to go back,
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.200]   they didn't have enough gold.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:54.600]   They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war,
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.720]   and they had printed a whole bunch of money
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.980]   that was out there.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:01.200]   So this begins the problem for England,
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.120]   and that begins the end of England
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.120]   as the world's superpower.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.560]   And the way they tried to fight that
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.560]   was to get more and more countries around the world
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.800]   to establish central banks
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.200]   and have unhold British pounds.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.640]   So they'd hold, basically dumping their bags
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.840]   like just any other shitcoin.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.280]   If you get people to buy your shitcoin,
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.280]   that raises the value of your shitcoin.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.960]   - Can you define shitcoin?
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:27.000]   - Shitcoin is, my definition of a shitcoin
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.720]   is that it's any form of money
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.360]   where somebody can produce it.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.360]   - So soft money?
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.080]   - Not necessarily, I guess.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:38.200]   I think the difference, so there's easy money,
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.120]   but the shitcoin is something that someone can produce
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.520]   at a cost that is different from the market cost.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.520]   So gold, nobody can make gold except that they dig for it,
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.220]   and the cost of mining gold
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.660]   is generally in the range of the price of gold.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:56.400]   Same is true for Bitcoin.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.800]   - So gold is not a shitcoin?
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.400]   - Gold is not a shitcoin.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.480]   - The copper is.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.360]   - I'm not so sure, I wouldn't call copper a shitcoin
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.840]   as much as it is easy money,
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.840]   but I think government currencies and other altcoins,
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.120]   I think are shitcoins because somebody could click a button
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.000]   and make 10 times the supply.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.040]   - Would it be fair to say that this began
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.160]   with the will for war in World War I?
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:28.160]   So the march towards fiat began
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:35.200]   with a global desire for war in the 20th century.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.720]   Did war start this, or was war a result?
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.880]   - It's difficult to say, really.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.240]   I think it goes both ways.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.240]   I think you can't have permanent war without fiat,
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.720]   and I also think there's a case to be made
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.680]   that you can't really have fiat without war.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.480]   So it's some kind of weird dynamical system
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.360]   with a chicken and egg situation,
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.800]   and they build on top of each other,
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.000]   and there's a few individuals that figured out
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.840]   there's a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game,
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.800]   and it escalates, and nothing gives you the ability
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:12.200]   to manipulate money quite like war.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.520]   When you have a war, you can declare an emergency,
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.680]   you can call all the people who oppose you,
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.680]   traitors, you can get people to support you,
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.400]   not because what you're doing is good,
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.280]   but because you play on their sense of tribalism.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.000]   - In your book, you do cost-benefit analysis,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.240]   so you do acknowledge or think about
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.480]   the pros of fiat currency.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.480]   Can you do just that, look at the benefit,
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.900]   and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.640]   - So the way that I write the fiat standard
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.440]   is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.480]   in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.320]   So with the Bitcoin standard,
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.040]   I looked at Bitcoin from first principles
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.320]   and tried to explain how it works for a reader
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.320]   that doesn't really have much of a background
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.760]   in computer science, networks, or economics.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.520]   And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.480]   Let's just ignore the official stories
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.280]   and look at how this thing actually works.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.480]   And I think it does have value in the fact
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.360]   that the reason that they were able to pull it off
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.120]   is because it was not possible for people
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:25.560]   who don't want to be part of it
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.040]   to use gold independently of governments.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.520]   This is really the key thing.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.880]   Gold is just very expensive to move around.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.080]   And the fact that it is expensive to move around
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.080]   means that there's inevitably going to emerge
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.120]   institutions where it is centralized in physical location.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.640]   And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   So really the gold standard intrinsically
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.920]   must involve credit as becoming part of the monetary system.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.080]   It has to be the credit.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.640]   And because it gets centralized,
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.920]   it can easily be captured by the government.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.720]   So to be fair, the benefit of the fiat system
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.320]   is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around,
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.960]   which is pretty significant.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.680]   Generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:18.840]   is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1%
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.600]   of the cost of the gold bar.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.320]   So you move it 100 times back and forth
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.000]   between the Atlantic, you need to pay the whole gold bar.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.080]   The cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times across.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.920]   Well, with fiat money, it's essentially government credit.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.280]   And so it's just sending a message
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.800]   from one central bank to another
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.840]   and you can move it halfway around the world.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.280]   - Is there also something to be said
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.000]   about the cost in time?
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.160]   So you're saving, you're reducing the friction
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.560]   of the communication as well.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.400]   - Exactly.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.560]   - Or the transactions as well.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.800]   - Exactly, it's faster.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.760]   - How big is that benefit?
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.000]   'Cause wouldn't you argue that that potential
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.400]   is the thing that enables modern economy,
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.120]   both the speed and the low cost,
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.000]   so increasing the scale and the frequency,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.920]   the speed of the transactions?
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.400]   - Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.200]   However, it isn't as if you couldn't have
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.440]   fast transactions built on top of gold.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:15.400]   So you could have gold being used for final settlement
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.600]   and you could have banks settling with one another,
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.080]   essentially using credit.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.960]   - Can you define settlement
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.400]   just for people who are outside of this world?
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.400]   'Cause we'll mention that word quite a bit probably.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.240]   - Good question.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.080]   So the way that it works is,
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.080]   let's say right now I'm gonna pay you $10
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:35.120]   over PayPal or credit card.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.080]   So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.000]   within a few seconds that I've sent you the money
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.240]   and then that's yours.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:46.240]   But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.880]   that my bank, which could be in another country,
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.040]   sent the money to your bank into your account.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.180]   There's a lot of infrastructure underneath that.
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:59.200]   So what actually happened is that I have an account
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.620]   with my bank and you have an account with your bank.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:05.560]   And when the message is communicated from my app to yours,
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   my bank crosses out the money
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.080]   and your bank credits you with the money.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.420]   And then at the end of the day, week or month,
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:16.560]   banks in the same city will settle with one another,
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.480]   banks in the same country will settle with one another,
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.720]   and banks from different countries
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.880]   will settle with one another.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.040]   So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.600]   At the end of the day or week or month,
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.160]   they'll tally all of the money that was sent
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.880]   from one bank to the other
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.320]   and then just settle the difference.
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.080]   So it turns out at the end of the month,
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.480]   my bank had sent $15 million to your bank
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.480]   and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.840]   So they give them $1 million and that settles it,
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.920]   that finalizes the transaction.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.680]   So final settlement really is like the,
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.640]   you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.840]   And then you can think of these things
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:59.360]   as being the higher layer levels.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.120]   And you had a wonderful discussion about that
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.740]   with Michael Saylor.
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:06.000]   - So the final settlement is like the moment
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.980]   when you paper an idea's connected physical reality.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.360]   - Yeah.
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:13.800]   - Or to some representation of physical reality.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.560]   - Yeah, and under gold,
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.760]   everything was tethered to physical reality
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.080]   because there was a market commodity
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.560]   at the bottom of all of this.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.480]   And nobody could print that market commodity.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.000]   And so at the end of the month,
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.280]   if your bank made too many payments,
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.720]   if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.100]   If you were reckless, if you were insolvent,
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.500]   you went out of business.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:37.720]   So there was no way to fool that.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.900]   But then we moved to the fiat century
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.940]   and everything is credit.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:42.780]   At the end of the day,
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.740]   the final layer is government credit.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:48.660]   And so as long as you're friends with the government,
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:50.340]   basically you never go bankrupt.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:54.260]   So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:58.880]   into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:03.020]   - So in part two of the Fiat Standard called Fiat Life,
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:05.680]   you describe the effects of fiat money on a bunch of things
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:08.900]   like life, food, science, education.
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:14.060]   What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.500]   on our world, on our life?
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.200]   So it's taking a step outside of the monetary system,
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.820]   actually like how that affects our life from this book.
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:23.500]   - I mean, there's a whole bunch of things
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.460]   and I won't be able to go over them
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.880]   and I highly recommend reading the book.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.540]   But if I were to pick one,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.860]   I would say it's the impact that it has
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:33.660]   on our time preference, on our valuation of the future.
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:35.660]   So remember when we started the discussion,
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:38.860]   I said that a key function of money
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:41.380]   is that it serves as a store of value.
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.900]   And the harder the money is,
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:45.220]   the better it is at providing us
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:48.140]   with a way for providing for our future.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:49.820]   And so the harder the money is,
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:51.300]   the less we discount the future.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.180]   We always discount the future compared to the present.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.180]   So if I told you, I'm gonna give you something today
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.620]   versus giving it to you 10 years from now,
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:00.860]   the same thing, you would prefer to take it now
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:03.260]   'cause then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:06.500]   So we always prefer the present to the future.
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:09.100]   There's always a discount on the future.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.900]   And that discount is called time preference.
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:13.580]   The degree to which we prefer the present to the future
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.380]   is called our time preference.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:18.940]   So the higher our time preference,
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.820]   the less we care about the future.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:22.180]   And the process of civilization
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.660]   is the process of lowering our time preference
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.580]   where we start caring more for the future,
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:29.700]   we start prioritizing the present less and less.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.860]   So we start being able to not consume everything
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.780]   that we have and store it.
[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:36.620]   And so money is essential for that.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.640]   And under the gold standard,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.660]   everyone in the world had the ability
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.340]   to provide for their future
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.220]   by simply using the same money that they use.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.740]   You know, you would work a day
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:47.540]   and you would get paid in a gold coin
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:49.060]   and you could take that gold coin
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.740]   and keep it safe for 10 years
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:53.980]   and know that at the end of those 10 years,
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:56.700]   that gold coin would buy you slightly more
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:59.380]   than what it bought you the day that you earned it.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:01.460]   So anybody could provide for their future
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.620]   and anybody could have very high degree of certainty
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:08.180]   that whatever they're saving is going to be there
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.300]   when they want it in the future.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.980]   Because the money supply was only increasing
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:13.480]   at one and a half percent,
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.860]   whereas the production of goods and services
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:20.100]   was increasing for most cases,
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.140]   for most periods at a higher rate than that.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.460]   So you could buy more apples and oranges
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:27.700]   and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.220]   than you could at the beginning of the 10 years.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.180]   So everybody had a way of providing for the future.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:34.300]   And with that, people lower their time preference.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:38.260]   And that is reflected across all aspects of life.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.060]   I think it's not just the economic thing.
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.260]   You see it in the savings rate,
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:44.940]   you know, the ability to deny yourself gratification today.
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:46.420]   I could take the money that I have
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:50.580]   and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.980]   And yet you decide that I'm not gonna do that,
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:54.380]   I'm gonna keep it so that tomorrow
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.260]   I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:01.300]   or have a better life or give my children a better life.
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:04.500]   So all of human civilization really is the process
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.680]   of us lowering our time preference
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.140]   and finding harder monies that allow us
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:10.980]   to provide better for the future
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:15.220]   is how we really technologically we do that.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.740]   I think of the hardness of money
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.740]   as being the control knob for our time preference.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.540]   And you can see this reflected in the 20th century
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.180]   where we go from the money supply increases
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:28.880]   at around one and a half percent under gold
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:31.480]   to this current situation where over the last 16 years
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.460]   I ran the numbers on money supply and fiat.
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.380]   The global fiat supply has increased
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:38.020]   at around 14% per year.
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:40.300]   So we've done a 10X in the increase
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.220]   in the supply of money annually.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.340]   And 14% is a weighted average.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:48.460]   So if you take a basic numerical average
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:52.020]   for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%.
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:55.060]   The average fiat currency increases by 30%.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:57.780]   But if you value it by the volume of each currency
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.180]   so that you're not giving equal weight
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:04.920]   to the Venezuelan bolivar increasing at 500% a year
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.040]   and the dollar increasing at 8% a year.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.500]   If you do it by value of the currencies
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.140]   so that you get the total supply fiat,
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:13.420]   it's something like 14%.
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.460]   - Unweighted is 30% you said?
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:16.900]   - Yeah, 30%.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:17.740]   It's insane.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:19.020]   - I'd like to see the worst ones,
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.300]   the people that are tracking that average up.
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.140]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:25.580]   But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number.
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:27.420]   And so you're saying that,
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:29.260]   sorry, that's the average over the century
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:30.080]   or the past 100 years?
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.180]   - Over the past 60 years, 1960 to 2020.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.020]   We get World Bank data on that,
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.660]   pretty reliable data on World Bank
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.640]   and European Union OECD data.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.660]   I ran the numbers on that weighted average,
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.140]   something like 14%.
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:45.220]   - And what effect that has on time preference?
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.860]   - The effect is now it's much, much, much harder
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.060]   for everybody to provide for their future.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.220]   Everywhere in the world, it's much harder.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:56.620]   So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:58.060]   that I could just put under my mattress
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:56:59.700]   and expect it to be there 10 years from now?
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:01.420]   Well, gold itself isn't cutting it.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.380]   Gold can't keep up with inflation.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.220]   And the reason for that is that gold is not being used
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:11.220]   as a money anymore in that you can't send it internationally,
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.740]   you can't use it to settle trade internationally,
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:18.660]   which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:23.340]   And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.820]   And as a result of the fact that its value
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.000]   doesn't keep up with inflation,
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.060]   it becomes economical to use it in industry.
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:32.700]   So we're seeing gold become like silver
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.360]   in that it gets used in industry.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.220]   So the stockpile declines.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.660]   And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:40.960]   And it becomes more and more of an industrial metal.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.940]   And it can't protect your wealth over time very well.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:45.920]   So what do you do?
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.340]   Well, you could invest.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.020]   And this is kind of the obvious answer
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.500]   that Keynesians will give you is,
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.920]   well, you just put your money in an investment.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.060]   But investment is different from saving.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:56.520]   Saving, the whole point of saving
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.800]   is that the thing is liquid
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:59.940]   and that the thing carries little uncertainty.
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:03.760]   You just held the gold coin and it just sat there.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.800]   It did nothing, it didn't take risk.
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.660]   You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.800]   Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.980]   to go and do something with it.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.420]   And it could work, it could not work.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.540]   If it works, you get a positive return,
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:18.100]   you get more gold back.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.160]   If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.420]   So taking on risk is something very different from saving.
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.940]   Saving is just a way of buying the future.
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:29.420]   Investing is taking on a risk
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.220]   and you could lose everything with it.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.220]   So what ends up happening,
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:35.260]   and this is the Keynesian objection,
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:39.700]   I think is very wrong and bad
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:44.040]   because investment is a job in itself.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.960]   To figure out what to do with your money
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.280]   in order to beat inflation
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:51.440]   is something that there are professionals out there
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.640]   on Wall Street that have PhDs in finance,
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.640]   that have enormous computers,
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:59.580]   and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.520]   and math nerds that are crunching numbers
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.160]   and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.440]   so that you can beat inflation.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.280]   And guess what?
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.480]   The majority of them don't beat inflation.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.380]   The majority of them can't beat inflation.
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:13.420]   Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:14.740]   but if you remember-
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:15.580]   - 14%.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:18.860]   - Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%.
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.060]   Like if you look at just the increase in the money supply,
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.100]   which I think is a much better metric,
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.380]   and this is what's reflected on the desirable goods.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.260]   Like if you look at the price of real estate in Miami Beach,
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:30.140]   as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.220]   it goes up at around 6, 7% per year
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:34.580]   on average over the last century.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.100]   So that's, if you wanna live in a nice area,
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.400]   that's what happening to real estate.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.920]   If you wanna go to the good universities,
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.760]   that's what's going up.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.040]   It's going up at a rate that's similar
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.880]   to the increase in the money supply.
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.240]   And you can beat CPI,
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.280]   but CPI is designed so you can beat it,
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:52.680]   but you can't really beat the appreciation
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.400]   in the things that you actually want to buy,
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.040]   in the price of good food, the price of good real estate.
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:01.640]   So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that.
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:06.440]   So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.740]   or an athlete have in doing those things?
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:11.700]   - Investment is hard and saving should be easy.
[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.540]   - Exactly.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:15.700]   Saving is essential for us as a civilization.
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:18.840]   And what fiat did is it took that away from us.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.180]   And then it forced everybody to become an investor
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.620]   or more accurately a gambler,
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:25.660]   because you're not just even,
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:27.500]   because the money itself is broken,
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.220]   because the money itself is constantly changing in value.
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:32.940]   Investing is becoming more of a crapshoot.
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:36.320]   I mean, value investing is completely underperforming
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.340]   compared to market analysis.
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.680]   You listen to the Fed and you,
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:47.000]   what matters to the price of individual companies
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.440]   is monetary policy much more
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.100]   than it is their own performance.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:52.420]   So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.020]   and following all of the world's central banks.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.740]   And you need to learn macroeconomics
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:58.860]   and you need to learn what all the central banks are doing.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.820]   And you need to understand how commodity markets work.
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.720]   And you need to understand how equity markets work
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.300]   and bond markets and real estate markets.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.020]   You need to do all of those things
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:10.300]   just in order to be able to save and earn
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:13.220]   and keep the money that you've already earned.
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:14.740]   That's the criminal thing about it.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:17.580]   Like I've already earned that money being a doctor,
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:19.580]   being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer.
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:22.540]   I built a house for somebody and I got that money.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.180]   And all I wanna do is just make sure
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.740]   that I can have it 10 years from now.
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:29.220]   The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:30.700]   because you have to spend half your time
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.580]   not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.260]   learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:40.100]   and commodity markets and what's gonna happen to copper
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.660]   and what's gonna happen to oil
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:44.540]   and what's happening in the wars
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.300]   and what's happening with foreign policy
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.040]   and Russia and the US and all of those things.
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.860]   Under the gold standard,
[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:54.340]   you didn't care about any of that stuff.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.780]   Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.060]   So what this means is the future.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:01.340]   So first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned,
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.420]   but also it means that the future
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.620]   becomes much more uncertain.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:08.780]   So you're far less likely to provide for yourself
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:11.140]   10 years from now, far less likely to find an easy way
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:14.820]   to give yourself value 10 years from now.
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:17.060]   And so you become more short termist.
[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:19.780]   And that is reflected economically in a lower savings rate
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:22.060]   and we see savings rates decline,
[02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:25.140]   but it is also reflected in all manners of decision making.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.540]   And I think if you really wanna see what it is,
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:30.780]   take a look at a society that goes through hyperinflation
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:32.540]   and look at what happens there.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:36.660]   How do people change under hyperinflation
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:39.780]   and compare that to essentially what we see
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:42.420]   in the 20th century all over under,
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:45.100]   not hyperinflation, but under low inflation.
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:49.580]   10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:51.820]   is just slow motion hyperinflation.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:53.420]   So what happens in hyperinflation?
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:54.940]   Everybody gets their paychecks,
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:56.860]   they run straight to the supermarket,
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:58.540]   they spend all of their money.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.220]   Nobody thinks about savings.
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:01.820]   Nobody thinks about the future.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.980]   Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.540]   How likely are you to be planning
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.100]   for what you're going to be doing five years from now?
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:14.260]   Very unlikely, but also it's reflected
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.300]   not just economically,
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:17.580]   it's also reflected in all aspects of morality
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:19.660]   and all the way in which we deal with each other
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:20.940]   as human beings.
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:23.540]   When your survival is precarious,
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:26.260]   how much are you invested in the notion
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.740]   of being a good citizen, on caring about your reputation,
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.780]   on caring about not getting caught in a crime?
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:35.780]   All of these things become harder to value.
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.140]   So people start committing crime,
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:39.820]   people start caring less and less about the future.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:41.300]   And we see it reflected in everything.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.700]   And I argue, you see it reflected in architecture.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:45.780]   You know, we used to build houses in the 19th century
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:47.580]   that last until today.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:48.700]   And then in the 20th century,
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:51.700]   we build essentially disposable cardboard boxes
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.420]   that get scrapped in 20 years.
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:57.740]   - So what can you say about potential positive effects
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:59.100]   of lower time preferences?
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:00.500]   So, I mean, it's a balance.
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:04.380]   Like, basically, you're talking about
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:05.740]   an average kind of time preference,
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:07.340]   but there's some things in life
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:10.580]   where low time preference could be a negative thing.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:13.660]   So like, if I want to take on risk,
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.900]   not for investment, or a kind of investment,
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:18.140]   but say I wanna start a business,
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.660]   I wanna take something crazy,
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:23.980]   take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.820]   What can you say about that kind of leap?
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:28.860]   Taking on debt.
[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:31.820]   What's the value of that within the current system?
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:33.860]   What's the right approach to that within the current system?
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.380]   What's the right approach overall
[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.060]   from an economics perspective?
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.380]   So it's not saving for the future.
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:43.540]   It's doing something wild,
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:45.380]   taking the money from your mattress,
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.660]   taking on debt, and having a dream in your heart
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:50.780]   that you somehow just want to do.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:52.940]   Maybe it's not the wisest investment decision,
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:55.700]   but it's something, you know, it's being human.
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:58.580]   It's taking a leap into the unknown,
[02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:00.700]   because something in your heart says to do it.
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:02.260]   - I think you're more likely to be taking the leap
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.420]   in the unknown when you have a little bit of gold
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:06.340]   in the mattress than when you don't.
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:07.380]   I think this is the thing.
[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:10.060]   Like, if you look at the late 19th century,
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:11.940]   and I discussed this in the Bitcoin Standard,
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.620]   that was the, arguably,
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:16.300]   the most innovative period in human history.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:17.980]   You know, there's qualitative evidence.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:20.260]   You know, look at the world around you today.
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:21.620]   Pretty much everything that we use
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:23.220]   was invented in that period.
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:28.220]   The car, the airplane, the telegraph,
[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.900]   the telephone, the camera.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:35.820]   Pretty much modern life as late 19th century.
[02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:38.820]   You know, the period between 1870 and 1914,
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:41.540]   'cause the whole world was practically on a gold standard.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:43.740]   The whole world was using the same money,
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:46.460]   and the whole world could save in the same currency.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:48.980]   That meant that a bicycle shop owner,
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:52.140]   two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:53.860]   could go and try and fly,
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.300]   even as all the scientific experts in 1903
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:01.340]   were confirming that the possibility of flight
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:03.740]   has been debunked as unscientific.
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.260]   You know, Lord Kelvin said,
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:07.620]   "Not in a million years we're going to be flying."
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:09.500]   Thomas Edison said, "It's never gonna happen."
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:11.180]   No, I think it was Edison who said a million years,
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:14.020]   but Kelvin also said, "It's never gonna happen."
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.420]   The New York Times said, "It's never gonna happen,"
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:19.860]   the same month in which the Wright brothers did it.
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:22.380]   And they continued to deny that it was gonna happen
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.140]   even two years after they did it.
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:27.860]   But that's, why could they do that?
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:29.460]   Because they had savings in gold.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:33.380]   They had the security with something that you know
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:34.620]   is gonna be there,
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.060]   and then you can take a risk with the stuff that is extra.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:40.140]   You know, I have say three years expenditures
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:42.220]   in gold under my mattress.
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:44.980]   And I know that I could take a risk with everything else
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:48.300]   because whatever bad things happen with all of my dreams,
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.700]   like even, you know, flying,
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.640]   think about how insane that is.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:54.300]   I still can go back to the three years of gold
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:55.120]   that I have saved.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:56.980]   - Is it okay to take on debt,
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.860]   given the stuff, the gold and the mattress?
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:00.940]   - Well, this is the thing, under the gold standard,
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:02.540]   the way that people finance things
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:04.860]   was predominantly with capital, with equity.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:07.340]   So you would, because you had gold savings,
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:09.720]   I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:11.840]   When you wanted to start a business,
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.460]   you could use your own savings or somebody else's savings.
[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:18.020]   So you didn't need to get into debt.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:19.980]   Well, you could get equity from others,
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:21.660]   and you could also get debt from others.
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:22.500]   So there was-
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:25.440]   - So it's directly mapped to physical reality.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.500]   - Yeah, it's directly mapped to economic reality
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:28.920]   in that there's a hard money out there,
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.120]   that, you know, what you're spending money,
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.000]   you know, you wanna build your airplane factory,
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.640]   you need to get actual resources.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.800]   So you get actual gold,
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:38.320]   either yours or somebody else's,
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:40.360]   you borrow it or you give them equity,
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.200]   but there's real resources.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.640]   Now, what happened with the fiat system,
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:45.760]   and this is, you know, the first part of the book,
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:46.600]   where I'd look at it
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.380]   from an engineering kind of perspective,
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:49.680]   is essentially,
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.840]   and I think this is like the breakthrough
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:52.120]   inside of the book,
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:56.260]   what fiat does is that it replaces gold mining
[02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:58.200]   with credit creation.
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:01.560]   The way that we make fiat money,
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:04.060]   the way that fiat is mined into existence
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.200]   is through credit creation.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:06.400]   Most people think of fiat money
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.320]   as being something that happens
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:08.680]   when government prints money,
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:11.420]   and we still use the term government's printing money,
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:14.480]   but the vast majority of fiat is not physical.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:16.200]   And in fact, fiat is not created
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.080]   when it is printed physically,
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.960]   it's created when it is lent.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.560]   So when you go to a bank
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.160]   to get a $1 million loan to buy a house,
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.640]   that bank is not gonna give you $1 million
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:29.480]   from their own money or from their depositors' money.
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:32.060]   They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars.
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.320]   When you walk out of that bank,
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.760]   the money supply has increased by $1 million
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.680]   to finance your home.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.320]   So what fiat does is,
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.520]   I mean, it was basically born out of government credit
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.280]   and the credit of banks
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:48.960]   that are backed by the central bank and the government.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.240]   - So if you're part of the institutions
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.300]   that are allowed fiat privilege,
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:55.400]   where you can just issue loans
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.960]   backed by the central bank, backed by the currency,
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.600]   you are effectively creating new currency, new money,
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.360]   every time you issue the loan.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:05.360]   - That's fiat mining is credit creation, I love it.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.100]   So can you say something,
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.000]   I mean, you can't really have credit
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.720]   without a demand for credit.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:12.480]   You can't really have an increase in supply
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:14.120]   without a demand for it.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.920]   Is there any value you place in the humans wanting it?
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:22.740]   Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit,
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:25.300]   wanting to take big leaps, big risks,
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.840]   big entrepreneurial decisions.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:31.220]   So is it all credit bad?
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.360]   - No, I think what's bad is,
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:38.400]   anything in my opinion, anything that is consensual,
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.600]   I wanna borrow money from you and we agree the terms,
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:41.840]   I can't object to that.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:46.080]   As long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that.
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.800]   But in the case of the fiat system,
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.960]   it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.600]   Everybody who uses the currency
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.800]   is forced to be part of that agreement.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.640]   Because if you default,
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.400]   effectively what's protecting the bank from you
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:01.760]   is the fact that the government
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.720]   can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.480]   So effectively--
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:09.360]   - Interesting, so that little agreement
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.120]   between the bank and you is actually an agreement
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.440]   between the bank, you and the entire populace
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.480]   that's using the currency.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.040]   - Exactly, they're forced to provide the safety net
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.400]   for you and me to go and make that loan.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.080]   And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.240]   That's how the whole thing actually works.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.000]   So this is why, I wrote the Bitcoin standard
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.320]   explaining Bitcoin and then basically
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.200]   the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.640]   is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can,
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.800]   'cause this is the best money that has ever been invented.
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:40.000]   - And we'll talk about that,
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.280]   why Bitcoin is the hardest money.
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.640]   - But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard,
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.600]   and again, this is not financial advice,
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.920]   I'm a lowly academic, you shouldn't listen to me
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:53.280]   on issues of money, but I think theoretically
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:55.720]   and intellectually, the conclusion of the fiat system
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:58.920]   is you need to be short fiat as much as you can.
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.240]   That's the smart winning move.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:03.320]   So human wisdom over thousands of years
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.240]   is to save, try and not borrow as much as you can,
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:08.520]   try and accumulate as much savings as you can.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.880]   That's reversed under fiat.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.760]   If you're saving money, you're just subsidizing
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:14.800]   everybody else taking on loans.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.440]   If you're taking on loans, you're benefiting
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.000]   from all the people that are borrowing.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.080]   So the winning move under the fiat system,
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.800]   and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:25.660]   Rich people under the fiat monetary system,
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:27.320]   they don't hold assets.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:30.760]   If you're worth a billion dollars today,
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:33.540]   you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account.
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:36.400]   You've got maybe 100,000, a million,
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:39.360]   five million or something like that.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.800]   A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.720]   The majority is going to be held
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.200]   in all kinds of other hard assets.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:48.160]   And you're gonna be borrowing.
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:49.680]   The richest people in the world
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:51.000]   are the biggest borrowers in the world.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.480]   The most powerful entities in the world,
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:55.000]   the governments, are the biggest borrowers in the world.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.980]   And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful.
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:00.180]   Because every time you're borrowing,
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:03.720]   you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money.
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:05.560]   So you're devaluing everybody else's money
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:06.940]   and you're getting a bit of the cut.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:10.360]   If you were going to buy a house with your savings,
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:13.120]   you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.960]   And if I were to go to buy the same house with credit,
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:21.440]   I'm getting the bank to print money for me.
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:23.720]   So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.960]   And that's why it's much cheaper
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:26.420]   for everybody to buy with credit.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:29.160]   That's why everybody buys everything on credit.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:31.440]   - So when we look at the global monetary system,
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:34.320]   the thing you wanna do as a government
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.520]   is be the sexiest currency out there.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.520]   So the main currency, like the dollar currently is,
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:46.040]   is the one that has the most power in that kind of context.
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.040]   So if you were to try to summarize
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:53.080]   what is the global monetary system as it is today,
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.440]   it's a bunch of fiat currencies battling for position,
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:03.120]   for use outside their nation,
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:05.360]   and in so doing trying to gain power
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:06.560]   in the geopolitical sense.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.400]   Is that if we just zoom out,
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.080]   what is the global monetary system?
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.960]   Like what is it currently?
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.960]   So outside of the United States, the whole thing.
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:17.320]   - Yeah, you could say that,
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.760]   but I think it's more realistic looking
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:21.600]   at how it has actually evolved over the past few decades.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.160]   It's really a dollar system.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:26.400]   It's not a system of currencies buying with one another.
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:27.320]   It's a dollar system.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.160]   And all other currencies are just basically,
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.000]   I like to call them dollar plus country risk.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.120]   So each--
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:36.360]   - It always returns home to the dollar.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.920]   - Yeah, there is no competition.
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.560]   There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:42.640]   And money is like that.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.560]   Gold was a winner take all by the end of the 19th century.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.200]   The global monetary market is effectively
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.560]   a winner take all for the dollar.
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.600]   And if we get it to Bitcoin,
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:56.640]   you'll know I also think digital currencies
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:59.320]   are also gonna be a winner take all situation.
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:01.880]   So money wants to be won.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:04.160]   In fact, there is no such thing as multiple currencies.
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:07.320]   Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:08.840]   Money is won.
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:11.080]   If you go back to a system of several currencies,
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.160]   you're just reinventing barter.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:16.000]   So in the case of the dollar system,
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.800]   the global dollar system is built around the dollar
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.280]   because all central banks have dollar reserves
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:24.600]   and because all central banks
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.680]   use the dollar's clearing mechanisms.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.440]   So that's why you're basically playing in the dollar system.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.640]   This seems to have changed over the last couple of months
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:35.560]   with the sanctions on Russia
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.760]   and the confiscation of Russian reserves.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:40.840]   It remains to be seen what that's going to do
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.520]   and how that's going to change.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:47.280]   But it is looking like this dollar system
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.720]   is clearly unsustainable.
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:49.920]   It's not sustainable for the US.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.840]   It's not sustainable for anybody.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.080]   - Speaking of which,
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.480]   so you do an amazing podcast
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.720]   called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.680]   So episode 108 of that podcast
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:03.960]   is about the very thing you just mentioned.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:06.520]   And allow me please to read the description of that
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.040]   and then ask you a couple of questions
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.760]   about your thoughts in general.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.200]   The description reads,
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.680]   after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:15.920]   the US confiscated the Russian central bank's
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.720]   significant monetary reserves
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:20.680]   and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:22.480]   Serious questions are being asked
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:25.200]   about the survival of the post-war dollar
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.120]   based world monetary order.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:30.160]   Will Russia, China, and other countries
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:33.400]   actually build an alternative international settlement system
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:36.440]   after years of threatening to do so?
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.640]   Will global central banks
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.080]   stop accumulating US treasury bonds
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:43.000]   and replace them with gold and commodities?
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.280]   Will we witness the birth of a new commodity
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.400]   gold-based monetary order?
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:48.560]   In this seminar,
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.680]   we use the insights from the Bitcoin Standard
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:54.840]   and the fiat standard on temporal and spatial salability
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.680]   to explain why reports of the death of the dollar
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.880]   and the emergence of a new gold standard may be exaggerated.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.720]   So I would love to get your analysis on this situation.
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:06.200]   What are the fundamentals of it?
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:07.320]   What is SWIFT?
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:09.120]   What are the possible future evolutions
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.280]   of the global monetary system?
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:12.480]   - Yeah, so SWIFT is the network
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.720]   that the US Federal Reserve uses
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:17.880]   for moving money around the world.
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.120]   So basically, the US government can sanction you
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:22.760]   off of SWIFT, as they've done with Russian banks,
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:24.640]   as they've done with Iran,
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.240]   and as they've done with Afghanistan.
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.000]   So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.120]   of the current monetary system,
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:35.480]   is that in order to be able to trade as a member,
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.360]   as a citizen of your country,
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.400]   you need your monopoly, local central bank,
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.600]   to be on good terms with the US government
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.120]   so that they would let them operate it.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.360]   And this is really, like,
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.560]   on top of the aspect of the hardness of money,
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:52.920]   this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin,
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:55.000]   which is that it's just purely a technological thing.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.600]   It doesn't matter if you're Russian, if you're Iranian,
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.240]   if you're American, if you're Chinese, it's a technology.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:03.600]   And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.200]   You operate it properly and it works.
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:07.560]   And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.380]   It doesn't care about your passport.
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:11.840]   If you have the private key, you click send,
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:14.760]   and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go,
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:18.080]   but effectively it does go anywhere it wants,
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:19.440]   and the money can move
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.520]   without having to abide by political situations.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:26.080]   And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.680]   much as that might be deserved.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.600]   I'm just going to discuss it
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:31.120]   from a kind of technical perspective.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.160]   It has to be a political system with fiat,
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.280]   because ultimately it relies on credit,
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.520]   and then the government is the one that has the guns,
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:38.820]   and the government is going to decide
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:40.560]   who gets to pay their loans anyway,
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.560]   and the government's going to have to make its own rules
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.920]   about who gets to play and who doesn't.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.400]   And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system.
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.280]   And when I wrote "The Bitcoin Standard,"
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.680]   initially I used to be much more of a gold bug.
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.640]   And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.480]   saying the global monetary system
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.640]   is going to collapse next week,
[02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:07.760]   and we're going to go back to a gold standard.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.240]   And writing "The Fiat Standard"
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:11.880]   gave me a very good appreciation
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:13.600]   for why this hasn't happened,
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.720]   and why it's not very likely to happen.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:18.840]   I think the reason is, as I said earlier,
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.800]   it's just gold is very expensive to move around,
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:22.480]   and perhaps more importantly,
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:24.180]   it's very expensive to verify.
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:25.480]   That's really the problem with it.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:27.180]   It's very expensive to verify
[02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:29.520]   that the gold that you're receiving is original gold.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:32.520]   So the only way to do this properly,
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.960]   it's to melt the gold bars down and recast them,
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.560]   which is pretty expensive.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.440]   So we have this situation now where Russia,
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:42.760]   which is one of the biggest economies in the world,
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.720]   has been kicked off to varying degrees
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:47.400]   off of the global monetary system,
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.320]   and the US has confiscated their reserves.
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.640]   I don't have political opinions about the war.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.640]   It's not something I'm very familiar with.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.480]   It's outside of my area of expertise.
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:58.880]   I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it.
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.800]   It is, on the one hand,
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:03.520]   whether you think the war is justified or the sanctions
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.040]   are justified is not something I can opine on,
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:11.040]   but the implication of this is that effectively,
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.000]   the US might be shooting itself in the foot
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.480]   because it's telling everybody in the world,
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.040]   your money in our system is not really your money.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.120]   It's just a token to play in our arcade,
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.800]   and any point in time, if you misbehave,
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.680]   we kick you away out of the arcade and we take your tokens.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.680]   And so, I mean, this is something
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.720]   that China, Russia, Iran, and many countries
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:35.080]   have made a lot of noise about over the past decades.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.280]   It got real this year,
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:43.280]   but it's been decades of China, Iran, and Russia,
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:45.980]   to some extent, saying that we wanna build an alternative
[02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:50.080]   to the US dollar-based system, and yet they haven't,
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.600]   and I think there's very good reasons they haven't,
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:54.040]   and the reason is, what do you do with it based on?
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:55.160]   How do you build it?
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:57.780]   So you can do a credit-based system based on,
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:00.480]   but then who's going to be the big boss?
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:02.120]   Is it gonna be China, is it gonna be Russia,
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.180]   is it gonna be Iran, is it gonna be India?
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:06.840]   None of these countries wants to be,
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:10.400]   they don't wanna jump out of the US-based system
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:12.560]   to get into somebody else's base system.
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:14.440]   So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system.
[02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:16.520]   Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system,
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.840]   and so therefore, you can't use
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.520]   their own central banks' currencies.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:23.220]   - Don't you think they have enough leverage,
[02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:27.800]   India, China, Russia combined, with several other nations,
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:29.920]   have enough leverage and incentive
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:32.040]   to create their own system?
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.600]   So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate.
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:38.200]   - Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you basing it on?
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:39.640]   Who's going to be the boss?
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:40.480]   Who's going to be the one who can--
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:42.500]   - Well, in this case, China, right?
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:45.880]   'Cause China's becoming increasingly
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:49.520]   an economic power in the world that's hard to deny.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.880]   - Yes, it's true, and it's the most likely scenario,
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:54.600]   perhaps, if we were to witness something like this,
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.240]   is going to be a Chinese-based system.
[02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:00.520]   - So is it possible to have a split
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:04.680]   in what is the driving currency of the world?
[02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:06.840]   - It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable.
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.160]   Again, money wants to be won,
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:10.560]   and that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar.
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:13.480]   So we could see this emerge based around the yuan,
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:17.480]   and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:19.600]   going to hurt economically from what happened,
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:20.920]   from the confiscation of the reserves
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:22.120]   and from the sanctions.
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:24.560]   So it's not going to be in a position,
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:27.660]   and of course, because it's outside of the US-based system,
[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.720]   it's not in the strongest negotiating position
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:31.640]   with the Chinese, so the Chinese might be able
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:34.920]   to get them to join their yuan-based system.
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.880]   But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:41.080]   because these governments can issue their laws
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:45.040]   and make their designs and then make their monetary systems,
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:50.040]   but ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.040]   and billions of dollar-based people,
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:53.680]   and they're gonna wanna trade with one another.
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:55.560]   And the power to want to trade with one another
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:56.400]   is too strong.
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:58.200]   We can't just split the world economy
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:00.720]   into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:02.920]   So then, they're gonna wanna trade with one another.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.920]   - Or the dark possibility is it,
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:12.640]   the inability to trade as opposed to being
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:14.400]   a forcing function for trade,
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:17.720]   it become a forcing function for conflict
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:20.280]   in cyberspace and potentially hot war.
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:22.560]   - Yes, this is the scary part of it.
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:24.800]   And this is basically how World War II happened,
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.040]   because there's an old historian who used to say when,
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.400]   oh, I think his name is Otto Mallory,
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:31.960]   and I quote him in "The Bitcoin Standard,"
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:35.600]   "If goods don't cross borders, then bombs will."
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:36.760]   If people trade with one another,
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:39.280]   they have an incentive for each other's well-being,
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.520]   and then they have less of an incentive to fight.
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.480]   And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.680]   because of the failure of the fiat system
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:52.040]   that brought about the rise of the populism
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:54.120]   and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.240]   and helped finance the war and bring it about.
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.100]   So that is the scary possibility.
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:00.960]   And of course, you can't discount that
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.560]   with all of the escalation that you see,
[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:05.520]   that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war.
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:09.120]   But then even so, I think ultimately,
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:10.680]   you can't fight wars forever.
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.840]   It's gonna end at some point.
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:15.640]   And we're gonna be back at square one,
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:16.920]   or well, not square one,
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.240]   we're gonna be back at the same dilemma
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:21.800]   of who's going to have the global monetary system.
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:24.560]   And so one alternative is that what the Chinese
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:25.440]   and the Russians could do
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:28.240]   is they could base it on a commodity.
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:29.320]   So a lot of people are now saying,
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:30.880]   well, they're gonna base it on copper
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:35.480]   and corn and agricultural commodities.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:38.160]   And that's the analysis of salability
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:39.720]   that we discuss in "The Bitcoin Standard"
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:40.880]   and the fiat standard.
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.200]   I don't think that's workable.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.760]   If you end up basing the monetary system on copper,
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:46.080]   as we said earlier,
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.500]   doesn't matter how many governments say
[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:50.120]   that we're gonna make a new monetary system
[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:55.120]   based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on,
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:57.260]   doesn't matter.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:23:58.240]   You're just gonna stockpile,
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:00.000]   you're gonna have to stockpile those things
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.400]   in order to make a market in them.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.720]   And then if you stockpile those things,
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.420]   you're just raising their value,
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:08.800]   inviting the producers to make more, flood the market.
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:09.940]   I hope they don't try this
[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:11.580]   because it's going to be a devastating,
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:15.220]   devastating impact on the world economy.
[02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:17.960]   You're gonna have central banks bidding up the price
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:20.800]   of essential commodities that people need for real uses
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:22.980]   in order to back their currencies with them.
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:24.800]   And then just incentivizing the producers
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:26.600]   to make more and more and more of it,
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:28.060]   and then bringing the price back down.
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:29.840]   So it's gonna be a very expensive mistake
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.660]   where we raise the price of copper,
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:33.840]   destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.620]   And it's not just copper, but also food.
[02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:38.260]   And then increase the supply beyond what we need.
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:41.700]   And the end result is copper miners make out well,
[02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:43.740]   governments go broke,
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.220]   and we end up with a lot of rusting copper
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:49.540]   in government warehouses.
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:51.640]   That's why I don't think it works for the,
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.360]   to use commodities that are not monetary commodities.
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:58.540]   Then the question is maybe gold.
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:00.780]   Can we go back on another gold standard?
[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:04.500]   And I mean, Russia seems to have done that.
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.620]   I'm not so sure.
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:07.660]   It's very difficult to get reliable information.
[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.320]   I'm trying to look into this more.
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.500]   But they seem to have said that
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:15.180]   they're fixing the price of gold in rubles.
[02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:18.660]   So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate,
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:20.900]   which effectively means you're on a gold standard.
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:24.660]   Now I'm not sure how much, how serious this is,
[02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:26.440]   how they managed to stick to it,
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.860]   but it seems to have stabilized the ruble,
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:31.000]   and in fact brought it back to its pre-war level,
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.300]   which I found absolutely astonishing,
[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:35.900]   considering all the sanctions going on.
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:39.700]   But in the short run, it's obviously much better
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.740]   than having your currency pegged to nothing.
[02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:44.460]   But in the long run, I also don't think gold
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.740]   is gonna cut it in the 21st century.
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:50.580]   - Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:54.700]   and go into the digital space on the blockchain,
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.820]   and go with Bitcoin?
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:58.980]   - I think, you know, the point of this discussion
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:01.380]   is that we run through all these other options.
[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:03.140]   You know, a Chinese-based system,
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:04.880]   why it probably won't work.
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:06.380]   A commodity-based system, why it won't work.
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:08.700]   And a gold-based system, why it won't work.
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:12.060]   I think they might have to learn this the wrong way,
[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:13.580]   I mean, the hard way.
[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:16.020]   But eventually, I don't see them doing it now,
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:18.740]   but eventually I think the winning move
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:21.460]   is going to be to go on a Bitcoin-based monetary system.
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:22.900]   - Well, I don't know if everything
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:25.780]   always has to be the hard way.
[02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:27.620]   - I'd love it not to be, but I mean,
[02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:31.980]   it doesn't look like there is any kind of desire
[02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:34.580]   in China or in Russia to switch to a Bitcoin-based system.
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:36.160]   - It's a leap to Bitcoin.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:39.740]   - So unfortunately, I think we're gonna go through
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:42.260]   a few years, maybe many years,
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.820]   of learning the lesson the hard way,
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:46.820]   of trying to accumulate these commodities
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:48.600]   and seeing the limitations that make them
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.460]   unsuitable as money today.
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:52.260]   - One of the things I'm really concerned about
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.880]   is the tension, the amount,
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.020]   the increasing amount of hate in the world.
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:26:58.900]   - Yes.
[02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:03.460]   - And the increasing amount of power centers in the world
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:09.500]   between which hate is making a regular appearance
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:14.500]   and because the weapons of war are becoming
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:16.060]   more and more powerful as they have been
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:19.680]   in the past many decades,
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:22.300]   I'm really concerned about nuclear war.
[02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:25.180]   So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this.
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:27.380]   - Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.
[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:29.060]   (Lex laughing)
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.060]   First rule of Bitcoin is if it's a problem,
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:32.060]   Bitcoin fixes it.
[02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:35.060]   - All right, well, I have some personal questions
[02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:37.100]   for Bitcoin then 'cause I have some,
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.020]   my life is pretty fucked up, so I'll have to try to see.
[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:41.700]   A quick pause for bathroom break, you need anything?
[02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:43.100]   - Sure.
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:44.820]   - Let's return to the basics.
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:46.380]   What is Bitcoin?
[02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:49.340]   We started with what is money, what is Bitcoin?
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:53.420]   We talked about hard money, inflation, fiat,
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.820]   the history of money, the history of war
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:58.640]   in the 20th century, and that takes us
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.300]   into the 21st century.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:01.140]   What is Bitcoin?
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:05.820]   - Bitcoin is a software, and it's a distributed software
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:07.380]   to operate the peer-to-peer network
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:10.580]   between members who are all equal on the network,
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:11.780]   they're all peers.
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:14.500]   And what this software does is that it allows you
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:19.380]   to operate a payment network between those peers.
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:22.340]   And that payment network has its own currency.
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:26.300]   And that seems like just a simple software game,
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:29.340]   but the reason this is such a big deal is I believe
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:32.420]   Bitcoin is the most advanced form of money ever invented.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.860]   And the reason for that comes from two properties
[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:36.840]   that this network has.
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:39.300]   The first one is that the currency
[02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:41.700]   is the hardest money ever invented.
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:44.780]   It's the money whose supply is the most resistant
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:48.080]   to inflation, it's the first monetary asset
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.260]   that we've ever invented that is guaranteed
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:53.300]   to be fixed in its supply, that cannot be increased
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:54.580]   beyond a certain number.
[02:28:54.580 --> 02:28:56.940]   So there's only ever gonna be 21 million Bitcoins.
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:00.620]   And that's a qualitative leap forward
[02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:02.660]   in our technologies of money.
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:05.580]   All of our monies leak essentially,
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.180]   because people can always make more and more and more
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.640]   of them, you know, the best money is the one
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.780]   that leaks the least, which is gold,
[02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:13.780]   because it only leaks one and a half percent.
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:17.820]   In other words, your share of the gold stock
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:21.220]   is diluted by one and a half percent every year.
[02:29:21.220 --> 02:29:23.220]   Ideally, you'd like it to be zero.
[02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:26.180]   Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8%
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:27.460]   headed towards zero.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:29.180]   So it's the first money that we've ever had
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:31.940]   that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply.
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:34.620]   So there'll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.
[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:36.900]   And I think that's a huge deal because, you know,
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:39.540]   as I said earlier, money is always whatever
[02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:41.260]   is the hardest to make, and now Bitcoin
[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:43.220]   is the hardest thing to make.
[02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:45.900]   And then the second property, which is extremely important
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:48.900]   as well, is the fact that it operates
[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:51.560]   without the need to trust in anybody.
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:54.060]   It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it.
[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:55.580]   It doesn't have a central authority
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:58.780]   that can, you know, it's, as I said, it's peer to peer.
[02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:00.620]   So there's, it only has users.
[02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:02.460]   It doesn't have any admins.
[02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:04.780]   There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:06.540]   that can take your Bitcoin, that can stop you
[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:09.620]   from using Bitcoin, that can change the rules of Bitcoin.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:11.100]   They can't make more of it.
[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:15.180]   So it's fixed, it's available for anybody in the world.
[02:30:15.180 --> 02:30:17.220]   It's the hardest money ever invented.
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:21.940]   And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously,
[02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:23.540]   enormously significant invention,
[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:26.500]   because if you read the fiat standard
[02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:28.620]   and the Bitcoin standard as well,
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:31.220]   you'll see my perspective for why I think
[02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:34.060]   a very large number of problems on the world,
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:36.060]   in the world are caused by easy money,
[02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:40.660]   are caused by inflation, and caused by government
[02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:44.220]   having access to essentially an infinite recourse
[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:45.900]   to people's wealth.
[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:47.820]   And I think Bitcoin fixes this,
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:51.420]   because it allows us to have money
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:54.420]   that has the salability of gold across time,
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:56.780]   meaning it holds its value across time,
[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:58.700]   like gold, but much better than gold.
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:01.780]   But also it has similar to, it is similar to fiat
[02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:03.820]   in that fiat can travel quickly,
[02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:06.100]   but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat.
[02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:11.100]   So it combines gold's salability across time
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.980]   with fiat salability across space
[02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:17.180]   in one immutable package that nobody can change
[02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:18.260]   and nobody can control.
[02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:20.100]   - Can you define the word salability?
[02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.940]   - Salability is the essential property of money.
[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:27.940]   It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:31.180]   specifically to be sold without much loss in its value.
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:33.580]   So houses are great for living in,
[02:31:33.580 --> 02:31:35.020]   but they're not very salable.
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:36.660]   If you wanna sell a house,
[02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:38.620]   you can't just click a button and sell a house
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:41.860]   and have a giant market of people buying houses from you.
[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:46.180]   You need to find somebody who wants the exact house
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:48.780]   that you have with the exact specifications that you have.
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:50.500]   And because houses are not identical,
[02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:52.980]   there's no liquid giant market for people to just buy
[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.380]   and sell identical houses from.
[02:31:55.380 --> 02:32:01.420]   So gold, for instance, has a good salability as money
[02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:03.900]   because it's a liquid good, it's uniform,
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:05.780]   and people are always buying it.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:08.180]   Fiat dollars have great salability
[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:09.860]   because everybody's always buying
[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:11.940]   and exchanging dollars for other goods.
[02:32:11.940 --> 02:32:13.740]   So if you have a hundred dollar bill,
[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:15.300]   you can easily get rid of it
[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:17.980]   and you'll get a hundred dollars worth of stuff for it.
[02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:20.860]   If you have a hundred dollars worth of stuff,
[02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:21.980]   it's harder to get rid of it.
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:24.580]   If you have a hundred dollar worth of phone,
[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:26.940]   it's not as easy to spend it as a hundred dollar bill.
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:28.380]   That's salability.
[02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:30.980]   - What do you mean that Bitcoin,
[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:33.260]   I understand that Bitcoin has the salability
[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:35.260]   of gold across time.
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:36.340]   - Better even, yeah.
[02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:37.180]   - Better, yes.
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:39.380]   Like an order or whatever.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:42.900]   And then has the salability of fiat across space.
[02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:43.820]   What does that mean?
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:44.780]   - So if you remember when you asked me
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:46.220]   what is the advantage of fiat?
[02:32:46.220 --> 02:32:48.140]   What is the advantage it offers us?
[02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:50.860]   It's cheaper to move fiat across space
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:52.140]   than it is to move gold.
[02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:54.800]   You know, with the current fiat monetary system
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:58.180]   for all of its flaws, you know, you can send money,
[02:32:58.180 --> 02:33:00.100]   you know, I could send money from my bank account
[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:05.100]   in the US to a bank account in China in a couple of days
[02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:08.900]   or in Britain, in France, in a day or two,
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:10.940]   which is, you know, much faster than you could do with gold
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.460]   and much cheaper than you could do with gold.
[02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:16.380]   But in reality with fiat, you know,
[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:17.780]   the reason Bitcoin improves on that
[02:33:17.780 --> 02:33:19.540]   is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling,
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:22.980]   you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours.
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:24.340]   So you send the Bitcoin transaction,
[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:26.460]   you get six confirmations in an hour,
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:29.780]   you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average.
[02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:31.240]   With 12 confirmations, you know,
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:36.240]   you're pretty definitely clearly safe on this.
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:38.360]   So within a couple of hours,
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:41.140]   you could send a billion dollars across the ocean
[02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:44.060]   and have final settlement on them.
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:46.620]   It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:49.140]   that's gonna need weeks and months to settle,
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:51.060]   which is the case with fiat.
[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:54.080]   So it is faster than fiat effectively.
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:56.980]   So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat.
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:33:58.580]   That's a good way of putting it.
[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:04.060]   - One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask,
[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:06.720]   to me on a human level, it's fascinating,
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:09.780]   is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,
[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:10.740]   an anonymous founder.
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.060]   There's no leader.
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:15.020]   So that's another aspect of the decentralization,
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:16.340]   it's leaderless.
[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:17.180]   - Yeah.
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:19.580]   - So unfortunately it's not a monarchy.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:20.420]   - Fortunately.
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:22.180]   - Or fortunately, yes.
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:24.580]   Who is Satoshi Nakamoto do you think?
[02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:26.700]   And first of all, is it you?
[02:34:26.700 --> 02:34:28.240]   - It definitely is not me.
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:30.460]   I don't know who it is.
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:32.020]   - If it was, would you tell me?
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:33.460]   (laughing)
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:34.380]   - It's a trick question.
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:35.580]   - Yeah, I know, trick question.
[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:38.060]   But I mean, everybody who knows me knows I can't really code.
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:41.120]   So you would say that even if you could.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:42.420]   (laughing)
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:43.340]   - That's true.
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:44.180]   - Do you think it's one person?
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:45.620]   Do you think it's multiple people?
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:47.020]   Is it interesting to you?
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:49.540]   Do you think it's fundamental to the coin itself,
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:54.100]   to not the coin, the entirety of the concept,
[02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:56.220]   that it's founders and anonymous?
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:58.620]   And how much guts do you think it takes
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:02.300]   if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:04.700]   - I've considered all these questions many times.
[02:35:04.700 --> 02:35:07.700]   It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:09.140]   to all of them.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:14.140]   I don't know who it is, and I don't know why he or them
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:19.540]   or she are not spending the coins that they most likely have.
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:22.980]   I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:24.860]   is the fact that he's not there.
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:27.140]   And this is what's truly astonishing about it.
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.660]   The fact, the most important fact in Bitcoin
[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:31.740]   is the fact that the creator has disappeared
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:33.420]   and the thing has continued to operate now
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:35.540]   for almost 12 years without him being there,
[02:35:35.540 --> 02:35:38.860]   or 11 years I think it's been since he's left.
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:41.140]   And this is really the most important thing.
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:44.500]   And maybe he died or she died,
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:49.420]   or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever,
[02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:51.220]   and that's why they haven't accessed their coins.
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:54.020]   Maybe they're incapacitated for some reason.
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:55.980]   But whatever reason it is,
[02:35:55.980 --> 02:36:00.580]   I really think it's fate or serendipity
[02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:04.540]   that is giving us this very vital,
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:07.980]   very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin,
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:11.160]   which no other digital currency would ever recreate,
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:14.780]   which is that, because it was the first,
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:17.380]   it was the one that was able to establish
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:19.540]   the first mover advantage and get all of the people
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:22.220]   who are interested in the technology to get into it.
[02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:23.780]   And so that's an enormous advantage,
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:27.300]   but the cherry on top
[02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:31.540]   or what made the whole thing really function well
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:34.020]   is the fact that the guy who made it disappeared
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:35.540]   and that it continued to operate,
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:37.700]   which is just a clear illustration
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:40.020]   that this is a network with no admins.
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:42.620]   And I'm tempted to think that they're incapacitated
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.420]   in some way, probably dead or gone,
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:48.620]   because I can't believe the,
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:51.780]   I don't believe any human being would have this level
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:54.740]   of self-control to not get into,
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:58.040]   not want to meddle with their invention so much.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:00.740]   Even if they, you know,
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:01.860]   they might've had the self-control
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.460]   to like mine the first million coins
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.820]   to get the network going and then throw away the coins
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:08.720]   or send them to an address that they don't have the key to,
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.140]   because they really just wanted the network to take off.
[02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:14.180]   They may have no access to the coins
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:15.440]   and that's why they can't move them.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:16.940]   I could see that happening,
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:19.700]   but I find it harder to believe that they would resist
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:21.820]   the temptation to mess with the network.
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:23.220]   - You know, it's funny.
[02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:27.620]   I find that the founders of ideas are often principled
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:31.420]   and have the integrity that the eventual users
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:35.540]   of those ideas don't fully have.
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:38.420]   I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view,
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:41.300]   power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:42.660]   And we tend to, in our mind,
[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.580]   generalize that all humans are corruptible.
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:47.620]   And perhaps that's true to some degree,
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:50.060]   but I think that some people are more corruptible
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:51.180]   than others.
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.700]   And I find that there is,
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:57.700]   I mean, I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto is out there
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:00.700]   and, you know, just like George Washington
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:02.180]   chose to walk away.
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:05.140]   And it's a principle and the principle is more powerful
[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:09.080]   than the financial reward or any of those kinds of things.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.340]   It's a principle that stands for freedom.
[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:13.980]   And there's a lot of people throughout history,
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:14.900]   even recent history,
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:18.100]   that are willing to die for these principles
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:23.100]   or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:26.980]   because they're still living a life of principle
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:29.140]   and choosing that day after day after day.
[02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:31.380]   So, I mean, there's power to that.
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:34.000]   Money, what's the worth of money in the end?
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.940]   In terms of just personal financial gain
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:42.940]   versus knowing how much positive impact there is.
[02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:46.220]   So the person that chooses to walk away like that,
[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:47.580]   I think is the same kind of person
[02:38:47.580 --> 02:38:52.580]   that chooses to live by that principle.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:54.140]   You have people like that, you know,
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:58.260]   in Grigori Grisha-Perelman in mathematics
[02:38:58.260 --> 02:39:01.780]   who turned down the Fields Medal because he was--
[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:05.640]   - Yeah, that's a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin.
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.480]   - Well, that's--
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.240]   - No, I know, I know, I'm joking.
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:09.580]   - Well, that's actually an interesting,
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:10.900]   just a brief comment.
[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:12.620]   You know, when people talk about Bitcoin
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:14.460]   in the cryptocurrency space,
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:20.020]   it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas.
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:24.380]   And I think those are often correlated,
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:27.620]   but that good feeling you get when you win
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:32.540]   or number go up or you just, just somebody,
[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:35.820]   you know, I found 20 bucks on the street the other day.
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:39.860]   And just that feeling of just like, ooh, like more money,
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:42.980]   that positive feeling, that's correlated,
[02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:45.820]   but it is distinct from the power of the idea
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:49.100]   to change the world for the better,
[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:51.540]   for the, to alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:52.980]   in the case of Bitcoin,
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:55.200]   that decreased the amount of suffering in the world
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:56.780]   because of the authoritarian regimes.
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:00.340]   And just because your number goes up,
[02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:04.220]   like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good.
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:07.140]   And I mean, short-term number go up.
[02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:08.540]   If there's a long-term number go up,
[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:10.800]   that's more like investment and so on.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.140]   And there's a short-term number go up,
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:14.540]   it's just a good feeling that you can't,
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:16.740]   you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct
[02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:21.300]   from the power of the idea to transform the world.
[02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:24.180]   And if you focus on the power of the idea,
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.860]   maybe a billion or billions of dollars don't matter as much.
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:30.420]   At least that's what I would like to believe.
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.620]   - Perhaps, but what matters ultimately
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:34.260]   is that the thing works without him.
[02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:35.900]   The thing's worked for 11 years without him.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:38.740]   And I think this is the really important thing.
[02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:41.680]   If they had stuck around for whatever reason
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:43.780]   and they had continued to meddle with it,
[02:40:43.780 --> 02:40:47.780]   it's not clear to me how decentralized it could have been.
[02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:49.340]   This is the problem with the other currencies.
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:53.500]   It's like, how do you lose control of the Frankenstein
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:54.700]   that you've created?
[02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:57.180]   The only way that this Frankenstein continues to survive
[02:40:57.180 --> 02:41:00.220]   is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.
[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:02.620]   And so it continues to be yours.
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:03.540]   And that's the problem
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:05.200]   with all the other digital currencies.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.300]   If you've heard about any of the other 16,000
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:10.060]   digital currencies out there, you've only heard about it
[02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:11.920]   because there's a small group of people behind it
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:14.440]   that are working on it, that are promoting it.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:16.080]   And that's why, and I think, you know,
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.360]   Michael Saylor's discussion with you
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:21.240]   was a magnificent illustration of the difference
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:24.840]   between Bitcoin and altcoins in that they are securities.
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:27.280]   And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.280]   for why this makes them categorically different from Bitcoin.
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.720]   Bitcoin, you're buying property.
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:36.880]   - I think he mentioned he's a huge fan of Dogecoin,
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:38.160]   but I might be misremembering.
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:39.240]   - You are misremembering.
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:40.540]   - Okay, me too.
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:42.620]   Maybe I'm quoting him out of context.
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:43.460]   - Yes. - Okay.
[02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:47.840]   Let me just ask you about some possible criticisms
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:49.120]   of Bitcoin.
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.920]   So on centralization, so there's a criticism on the,
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.000]   so on the mining and on the node side,
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.020]   or the node is not really the criticism,
[02:41:58.020 --> 02:42:00.940]   but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:04.640]   because a small number of miners control a majority
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.200]   of the hashing power.
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:08.400]   I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000,
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:11.920]   whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes,
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:13.000]   that have the full,
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:16.680]   that are actively connected to the network.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.360]   So you could argue that's decentralized
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.480]   'cause it's global, it's all across the world,
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:25.480]   but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized.
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:27.400]   So if you're thinking of making a case
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:30.240]   for Bitcoin being decentralized,
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.440]   do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:37.440]   Is the nodes the important thing to think about?
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:38.800]   - Yeah. - And what number
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:41.360]   of nodes counts as centralized and not?
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.480]   - The nodes are what matters
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:45.280]   because the nodes are what determines
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:46.800]   Bitcoin's consensus parameters.
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:50.800]   I think the best way to think about it
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:54.800]   is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:56.960]   and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks.
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:42:59.000]   So what a miner does is they solve
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.440]   the proof of work problem.
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:02.360]   So they keep operating their computers
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:04.920]   until they can get a solution to the problem.
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.080]   And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:08.840]   and present it to the nodes
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:11.520]   for the nodes to ratify and approve it.
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:14.320]   So therefore, this is, and this is,
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:16.320]   I strongly recommend people learn
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:18.800]   about the 2017 block size war
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:21.720]   to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin.
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.120]   I discussed this briefly in my "Bitcoin Standard,"
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:27.760]   but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:30.680]   called "The Block Size War" by Jonathan Beer.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:33.840]   It's a great description of, in 2017,
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:35.040]   essentially the miners thought
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:36.240]   that they could control Bitcoin.
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.680]   You know, they had, there was one mining company
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:42.400]   that produced the majority of the machines
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:43.720]   that were on the network.
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:47.200]   And they, and their allies had a control
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.640]   of the machines that were out there
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:51.840]   and they controlled the majority of the hash rate.
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.200]   And they thought that they could change Bitcoin's supply,
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:57.800]   not supply, sorry, they could change Bitcoin's block size,
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:01.840]   which is a tiny little detail, technical parameter.
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:04.080]   It's not even all that big of a deal
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:05.440]   for the economics of it.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:08.320]   But they thought that they could pass this change.
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:10.600]   They could force this change on the network.
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.800]   And the members of the network rejected it
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:15.200]   and they weren't able to do it.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.560]   So the nodes are what is sovereign.
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:20.400]   The nodes are what determine the rules of the game.
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:23.560]   The miners are a service provider.
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:25.960]   The miners invest capital upfront.
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:27.760]   You know, they buy the machines,
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:29.000]   they buy the electricity,
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.600]   they buy the storage, they buy the locations,
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:33.200]   they pay the rent,
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:34.900]   and they invest all of that money.
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.940]   Based on the idea that if they behave
[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:39.860]   according to what the nodes want,
[02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:42.180]   the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin.
[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:43.580]   So the miners are in no position
[02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:45.020]   to dictate terms for anyone.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:47.820]   You know, they've put up their capital upfront
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.460]   and they will only recoup it
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:51.660]   if they do what the nodes want.
[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:53.340]   So therefore, what really matters
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:54.900]   is the decentralization of the nodes.
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:58.700]   So you wanna have as many nodes as possible.
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:00.540]   You wanna have a system where
[02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:01.940]   there's a large number of nodes.
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:04.380]   And this is of course the biggest problem
[02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:07.740]   with other digital currencies
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:08.700]   is that, you know,
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:11.180]   because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market
[02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:13.020]   on a digital currency,
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:15.340]   the only way that you can really get fraction
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.100]   is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords,
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:20.460]   but you know, we're doing this and we're doing that.
[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:23.780]   And so other digital currencies are optimized
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:27.940]   for bells and whistles and buzzwords.
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:30.740]   And that means adding a computational load,
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:33.660]   which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate,
[02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:35.660]   and therefore you have a very small number of nodes.
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:38.380]   In fact, very few digital currencies
[02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:42.060]   are keen to publicize how many nodes there are,
[02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:44.340]   and they don't have full nodes in the true sense.
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:46.540]   And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have
[02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:50.260]   because de facto, you know,
[02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:54.660]   you can spin up a million nodes tomorrow on AWS.
[02:45:54.660 --> 02:45:57.140]   Doesn't really matter.
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:45:59.020]   What matters is de facto,
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:02.220]   do the nodes dictate the rules of consensus?
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:03.940]   And the fact that with most digital currencies,
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:06.140]   you can have hard forks very frequently
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:08.180]   and they can change the supply all the time
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.540]   means that there's a small group of people
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.860]   who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:15.180]   - Yeah, so you threw in a few criticism of all coins there,
[02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:17.180]   but so one is the small group.
[02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:19.740]   That one we could talk about, it's a tricky one.
[02:46:19.740 --> 02:46:22.660]   And we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto,
[02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:25.660]   but the other one is small number of nodes
[02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:27.300]   sort of to push back on that.
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:28.980]   As computational power increases,
[02:46:29.020 --> 02:46:33.580]   you can argue that that enables more and more cheap computers
[02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:35.740]   to serve as nodes.
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:38.020]   So at least it paints a future
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:40.140]   where nodes are always increasing
[02:46:40.140 --> 02:46:42.420]   because computational power is always increasing
[02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:44.580]   and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:46.180]   So at least there's a hope for the future
[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:49.140]   for greater and greater decentralization
[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:50.460]   on the node front.
[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:52.860]   - Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,
[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:55.460]   it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have.
[02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:57.700]   If you have a, you know,
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:46:59.540]   if the way that the currency is run
[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:01.740]   is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months,
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:03.540]   which is the case with most other currencies,
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:06.100]   Bitcoin is the only one that's not have a hard fork.
[02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:10.180]   Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:12.220]   in a technical sense is that you could get
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:16.860]   the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:21.700]   to start the network, and you could run it today
[02:47:21.700 --> 02:47:23.180]   and it would sync with the blockchain.
[02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:25.420]   There's one bug you need to fix.
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:28.460]   One mistake that would have only appeared,
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:31.380]   I think in around 2013 or '14 or something like that,
[02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:33.020]   as that he wasn't aware of back then.
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:35.500]   So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug.
[02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:37.660]   And then the consensus parameters are still the same.
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:39.380]   So you're able to sync to it.
[02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:41.500]   This is not true for most other digital currencies.
[02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:42.900]   I'd say probably all of them,
[02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:44.860]   because they've all had many hard forks,
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:46.380]   which they think of as upgrades.
[02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:49.420]   And, you know, they market this thing as, you know,
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:52.460]   well, Bitcoin can't upgrade, but we upgrade all the time.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:55.300]   Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:57.220]   Facebook, Apple, Amazon,
[02:47:57.220 --> 02:47:59.420]   anything that centralizes is very easy to upgrade.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:01.460]   And that's precisely why, as Michael Saylor says,
[02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:03.700]   these things are somebody's liability.
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:04.620]   They are security.
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:07.180]   You're carrying on somebody's technical
[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:08.780]   and economic liability.
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:12.740]   They can, hard fork, they can 10X the supply tomorrow.
[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:13.980]   - Yeah.
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:18.980]   They can fall victim to the same corrupting forces
[02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:21.860]   that governments fall victim to.
[02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:23.020]   Sure, and for people who don't know,
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:28.020]   yeah, hard fork is a reverse incompatible change
[02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:34.260]   to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:40.140]   Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well.
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:43.300]   I'm sure all of which you love dearly.
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:44.860]   Anyway, but that doesn't matter.
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:47.580]   The original Bitcoin, for the most part,
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:49.980]   has not undergone any changes.
[02:48:49.980 --> 02:48:50.820]   And that's one of the...
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:51.980]   - I mean, it has undergone changes,
[02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:56.980]   but none in the important parameters of the network.
[02:48:56.980 --> 02:49:00.020]   - So another criticism is about energy.
[02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:02.700]   So the proof of work,
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:05.160]   the assessments mechanism uses a lot of energy.
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:08.700]   What's the response to that criticism of Bitcoin?
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:10.740]   - Yes, because it's worth it.
[02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:13.060]   - Okay.
[02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:14.740]   - The airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak.
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:16.820]   You know, when you're gonna cross the Atlantic next time,
[02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:17.660]   what are you gonna take?
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:19.660]   A kayak that is environmentally friendly,
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:21.620]   according to this insane definition?
[02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:22.820]   Or are you gonna take an airplane
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:24.020]   that consumes a lot of energy?
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.780]   - So the cost benefit analysis here,
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:29.540]   essentially you have to consider
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:31.340]   both the cost and the benefit.
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:32.180]   - Exactly.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:34.900]   And I think it's an astonishing testament
[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:38.540]   to just how far backward people's scientific
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:41.380]   and technological thinking has devolved
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:43.340]   to the point where we think of energy consumption
[02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:44.180]   as a bad thing.
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:45.020]   I think it's just...
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:46.260]   And in the fiat standard,
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:48.900]   I discussed the whole hysteria around energy.
[02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:52.780]   And I think it's a product of fiat inflation
[02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:55.620]   because it's a way of trying to covering up the fact
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:58.420]   that energy is fuels that are reliable
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.580]   and necessary for the current world
[02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:03.660]   are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation.
[02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.820]   And so governments are always looking for excuses
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:07.900]   for why you should not be using those things.
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:10.180]   And so they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:13.340]   to tell you about why these things are bad.
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:16.980]   But really, you know, all technology is,
[02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:19.780]   well, not all, but the vast majority
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:22.180]   of technological innovations involve
[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:24.540]   economizing on human time and judgment
[02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:26.020]   and replacing it with machines,
[02:50:26.020 --> 02:50:28.420]   with reliable machines that spend a lot of energy.
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:31.060]   So that's what a telephone does.
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:33.180]   Instead of having to send somebody across the world
[02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:36.100]   to tell somebody something else or send a letter,
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:38.780]   a telephone allows you to do it.
[02:50:38.780 --> 02:50:39.820]   The car is like that.
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:43.020]   You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy,
[02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:44.740]   but it allows you to travel much faster
[02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:47.260]   and safer and more reliably.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:48.740]   An airplane is like that.
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:52.460]   Modern telecommunication, human prosperity
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:54.700]   is an increase in the consumption of energy.
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:58.820]   And I think it is an absolutely criminal thing.
[02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:01.660]   And I genuinely mean the word criminal
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:04.860]   to portray energy consumption as a bad thing
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:07.300]   because it is truly depriving people of the chance
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:09.140]   to live a life that makes life better.
[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:12.500]   You know, it's truly criminal to tell poor countries
[02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:15.460]   that they should not consume the same energy sources
[02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:17.060]   that are being used in rich countries
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:21.900]   on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies.
[02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:22.820]   That's what life is.
[02:51:22.820 --> 02:51:25.780]   You know, if you reduce the consumption of energy in the US
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:28.540]   to the levels that you have in poor countries today,
[02:51:28.540 --> 02:51:30.340]   the US would become desperately poor.
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:31.420]   A lot of people would die.
[02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:32.540]   Cities would collapse.
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:34.580]   - The quality of life would decrease significantly.
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:37.100]   A high quality of life often requires,
[02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:39.620]   given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy.
[02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:41.060]   - Yeah, and I should be clear, you know,
[02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:42.740]   it's not a quality of life in the sense of,
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:45.380]   many people think of this as, oh yeah, well, you know,
[02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:50.220]   taking needless flights for vacations.
[02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:53.420]   No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake.
[02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:54.940]   But the substance of the cake
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:59.860]   and the real benefits of energy is the fact that children,
[02:51:59.860 --> 02:52:02.780]   premature babies survive in countries
[02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:05.540]   that have reliable 24-hour cheap electricity.
[02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:07.180]   If your child is born premature,
[02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:10.440]   that you put him in an incubator or her,
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:11.860]   they're highly likely to survive.
[02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:14.220]   If you don't have 24-hour electricity,
[02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:16.020]   that child is not gonna make it.
[02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:18.940]   And you see it, you know,
[02:52:18.940 --> 02:52:20.780]   the level of energy consumption per capita
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:23.420]   has highly correlated not just to income,
[02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:26.280]   but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:28.460]   to all of the things that you care about.
[02:52:28.460 --> 02:52:31.860]   And Bitcoin is just another technology.
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:34.660]   It does consume a lot more energy than central banks.
[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:37.860]   A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:40.100]   by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money
[02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.740]   and ATMs consume energy.
[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:44.200]   And I think if you calculate
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:45.900]   how much central banks and banks consume,
[02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:49.660]   I think it's a rounding error next to what Bitcoin consumes.
[02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:52.160]   I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error,
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:53.820]   but it's still, Bitcoin is, I think,
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:56.220]   is going to consume a lot more, and that's a good thing.
[02:52:56.220 --> 02:52:58.140]   - You know, what's humbling is to look,
[02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:00.100]   'cause even just looking into this
[02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:02.440]   forces me to look at the energy expenditures
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:04.660]   for many of the things we take for granted.
[02:53:04.660 --> 02:53:08.900]   Obviously, computers and our digital lives
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:12.020]   are just, Bitcoin becomes a rounding error
[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:15.060]   relative to how much energy is spent
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:16.860]   on all the computers in our world.
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:19.820]   But also, like, things like home appliances,
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:22.660]   microwaves, and hair dryers and stuff.
[02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:23.500]   - Yeah.
[02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:24.380]   (Lex laughing)
[02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:25.220]   Yeah, I mean, this is--
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:26.740]   - This starts being hilarious.
[02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:29.520]   It's like, oh, these things that are just part
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:33.260]   of our modern life, they're either the same order,
[02:53:33.260 --> 02:53:35.900]   at least the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin,
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:39.340]   and they seem like trivial parts of life.
[02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:40.620]   - Yeah, and this is the thing.
[02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:41.780]   All of the people that complain
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:43.220]   about Bitcoin's energy consumption,
[02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:45.140]   I presume they use washing machines.
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:49.980]   Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes
[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:52.180]   get to consume energy?
[02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:54.980]   And I mean, I used to live in Lebanon.
[02:53:54.980 --> 02:53:56.340]   Lebanon had hyperinflation.
[02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:58.940]   I escaped from hyperinflation.
[02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:00.600]   I escaped, I prevented.
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:03.620]   My life could have been ruined by hyperinflation,
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:04.740]   and the reason that it wasn't ruined
[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:06.220]   is because I have Bitcoin.
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:10.180]   So, I don't know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?
[02:54:10.180 --> 02:54:11.020]   - Yes, please.
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.140]   - So, fuck your washing machine.
[02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:14.820]   (both laughing)
[02:54:14.820 --> 02:54:17.460]   Given a choice between my washing machine and my Bitcoin,
[02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:19.100]   I'll choose Bitcoin.
[02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.700]   It's a technology that has already saved my life,
[02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:22.820]   and I think it's gonna save the lives
[02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:24.660]   of many, many, many, many more people.
[02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:27.520]   But of course, I don't have to choose
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:31.180]   between my Bitcoin and my washing machine,
[02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:35.220]   because we're just constantly consuming more energy,
[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:36.700]   and we're gonna continue to consume more energy
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:39.900]   in this world, and that's just what progress is.
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:42.700]   And a small remark, so in principle,
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:43.860]   I don't think this is a problem,
[02:54:43.860 --> 02:54:45.020]   but the other thing about Bitcoin,
[02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:47.380]   where it is different from washing machines,
[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:48.900]   Bitcoin is truly unique in this.
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:52.860]   It's the only thing whose energy consumption
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:55.240]   can be produced absolutely anywhere.
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:57.300]   Your washing machine needs to be in your house
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:54:58.980]   where you live, and you live in a city
[02:54:58.980 --> 02:55:00.780]   surrounded by 10 million people,
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:02.940]   and they all have their washing machines,
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:04.540]   and they're all connected to the grid,
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:06.540]   and they generally tend to do their laundry
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:10.100]   around the same time, and so you have to put
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:13.100]   the load of the washing machine on the grid
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:14.380]   at the same time.
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:16.360]   There needs to be one power plant,
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:17.980]   and all of the infrastructure needs to work
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:20.060]   at the same time, and the electricity is pretty expensive
[02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:23.380]   because it's being done in a place with high demand.
[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:26.260]   Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity
[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.380]   from places where it has high demand,
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:30.340]   because it can buy electricity from anywhere.
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:32.340]   This is what's truly mind-blowing about it.
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.620]   You can buy, you know, what you need,
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:37.220]   the electricity that you need for mining
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:38.280]   can be done anywhere.
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.140]   So you can mine, you know, you can have a waterfall
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:44.580]   in the north of Canada, 300 miles away
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:46.500]   from any population center.
[02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:48.540]   There's water falling, there's energy.
[02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:51.140]   You can put a hydroelectric dam there,
[02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:53.500]   and then you can use that energy to operate the miners,
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:55.580]   and then the miners just need a satellite
[02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:57.340]   internet connection, and effectively,
[02:55:57.340 --> 02:56:00.060]   you're selling that energy that is isolated
[02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:02.900]   to the grid, and because of the way the Bitcoin functions,
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:04.820]   because of the difficulty adjustment,
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:07.260]   the only profitable miners are the ones
[02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:09.260]   who can get cheap electricity.
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:11.660]   Basically, if you're mining at grid cost,
[02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:14.540]   if you're mining at around, the average electricity price
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:16.740]   in the world is around 14 cents.
[02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:19.140]   If you're mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin,
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:21.340]   you're most likely not gonna make it.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:23.900]   If you're running your miners at 14 cents,
[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:26.020]   'cause everybody could mine at 14 cents,
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:30.420]   and so what happens is if everybody's mining at 14 cents,
[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:32.740]   14 cents stops being profitable,
[02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:34.780]   and then only the people mining at a lower price
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:37.500]   are profitable, so that's why Bitcoin mining
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:39.340]   is not competing with your washing machine.
[02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:42.180]   This is the absurd thing about this kind of
[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:45.780]   energy scarcity viewpoint where,
[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:47.700]   oh no, it's a catastrophe, Bitcoin is taking
[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:49.420]   all the electricity, as if the electricity
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:51.900]   is just one fixed pie that we all have to share
[02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:53.940]   and fight over, and this is,
[02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:55.900]   that's how I keep making fun of these stupid headlines.
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:57.700]   They put out where Bitcoin's consuming
[02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:59.740]   more electricity than Portugal.
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:03.100]   All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then.
[02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:05.220]   What the hell has Portugal given us?
[02:57:05.220 --> 02:57:07.060]   Obviously, it's not--
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:08.100]   - No, he doesn't mean that.
[02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:09.780]   I've gotten so much criticism for saying
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:12.540]   Cristiano Ronaldo's not in the top five.
[02:57:12.540 --> 02:57:14.100]   I apologize.
[02:57:14.100 --> 02:57:16.180]   I love Portugal.
[02:57:16.180 --> 02:57:17.980]   - That's another discussion we should get into.
[02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:20.460]   - What we should do, 'cause you posted a few soccer things.
[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:23.460]   I'm not, I realize how passionate people are about this.
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:25.020]   Listen, it was a joke, all right?
[02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:27.500]   - He deserves to be a potential in the top five.
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:28.940]   - Yeah, I love Portugal.
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:30.420]   And even though I'm a Liverpool fan,
[02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:32.460]   I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot.
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:35.540]   In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion
[02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:37.700]   where I think Cristiano Ronaldo's
[02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:39.060]   the greatest football player ever.
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:41.100]   - Number one, over Pelé and Maradona,
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:42.380]   Messi, better than Messi.
[02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:44.140]   - Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top.
[02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:44.980]   Nobody's ever done that.
[02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:46.540]   He's won everything everywhere.
[02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:49.340]   Everywhere he goes, at the top, at the Champions League.
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:53.060]   Really strong argument to be made for him.
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:55.140]   Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona.
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:55.980]   That's the thing.
[02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:59.340]   - So you appreciate performance, long-term,
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:03.540]   versus the genius of the actual play on the field?
[02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:05.700]   - I mean, the genius is,
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:07.540]   Ronaldo's the top scorer of all time.
[02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:08.380]   He scores more goals. - So the genius
[02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:11.980]   is in the scoring, not the actual dance of the play,
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:13.380]   the creativity.
[02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:14.580]   - Well, I mean, I don't know.
[02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:18.140]   Messi's been absolutely mediocre since he's left Barcelona.
[02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:20.020]   - These are strong words.
[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:23.140]   - He scored, what, two goals in PSG's season this year?
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:24.900]   They're out of the Champions League.
[02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:26.220]   - What about Mohamed Salah?
[02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:29.060]   You've posted about him. - Oh yeah, he's my boy.
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:31.460]   - Is he climbing up to be somewhere in the--
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:33.020]   - I think he should win the Ballon d'Or this year.
[02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:34.740]   He probably should have won it last year as well.
[02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:36.180]   He's been absolutely outstanding.
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:39.700]   But I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi,
[02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:40.780]   they keep giving him accolades.
[02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:42.140]   He hasn't deserved, I think, Messi
[02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:44.980]   the last couple of Ballon d'Ors that he got.
[02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:46.340]   I mean, he's a great player and everything,
[02:58:46.340 --> 02:58:49.260]   but no, he did not deserve it last year.
[02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:51.820]   (sighs)
[02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:53.940]   We can agree to disagree.
[02:58:53.940 --> 02:58:54.760]   There's something--
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:56.820]   - Are you a Barca fan or a Messi fan?
[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:59.580]   - I would say, no, I wouldn't say I'm a Barca fan,
[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:01.260]   but a Barca fan because of Messi.
[02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:04.700]   And I just, I think it's like, there's certain things.
[02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:09.860]   So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,
[02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:14.460]   I remember Maradona, he was the first person
[02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:17.600]   I saw that I was like, oh wow, this could be,
[02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:22.840]   this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport.
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:24.840]   And for some reason, I mean, it's something about
[02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:26.520]   like Diego Armando Maradona,
[02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:28.280]   like the way they were commentating,
[02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:31.640]   the genius of his play, the mix of ego,
[02:59:31.640 --> 02:59:32.920]   and again, the performance,
[02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:35.360]   but being able to carry a team on his shoulders,
[02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:38.640]   that I just fell in love with whatever he represented,
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:40.600]   and then by that, Argentina.
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:44.200]   And then Messi, I saw when he was like 16, 17,
[02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:46.080]   when he was just like, in the early days.
[02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:49.520]   And when you first see a person and you see the genius
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.960]   and you notice that, and then it turns out to be
[02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:55.280]   actually a great player, for some reason, you're invested.
[02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:59.320]   You're emotionally invested, you're, I don't know.
[02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:03.040]   So you kind of just fall in love and then you pick sides.
[03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:04.520]   I mean, that's the thing about football.
[03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:08.720]   Part of the fun things about football, soccer is like,
[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:12.240]   you pick a guy, you pick a team and fuck everyone else.
[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:13.760]   And you just have fun talking shit.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:15.440]   I mean, that's part of it.
[03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:18.360]   - It's great, it's great because I think,
[03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:19.760]   obviously it's a very stupid thing to do,
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:21.800]   but I think if you don't do it in football,
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:22.640]   you're gonna do it in real life.
[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:23.800]   - Elsewhere, that's right.
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:25.120]   - That's why it's very good.
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:28.360]   That's it, instead of hating people for their religion
[03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:30.520]   and for their skin color,
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:32.440]   hate them because they support Manchester United.
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:33.960]   - Exactly. (laughs)
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:35.160]   So you're a Liverpool fan, that's--
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:37.280]   - Yes, yes, hardcore long-term.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:41.800]   But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal--
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:43.520]   - Energy. - Yeah, energy.
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:45.920]   Bitcoin is not competing with Portugal
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:47.400]   because Bitcoin is buying energy
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:49.240]   from places where we can't buy it.
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.280]   Because all the places where we can buy energy
[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:53.640]   for our washing machines,
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:55.720]   we're bidding up the price enough
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:00:58.000]   to make it non-viable for Bitcoin.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.280]   That's why, you'll see those headlines
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:02.360]   about Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal.
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:03.480]   Well, if you look at Portugal,
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:06.120]   I mean, they've got giant power plants in Portugal,
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:07.400]   they've got millions of people
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:09.720]   and they've got enormous amounts of infrastructure.
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:13.240]   Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:14.880]   You don't see it in the cities.
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:18.840]   It's all isolated, it's all out away from the cities,
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:21.960]   or it's connected to grids that have serious overcapacity.
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:25.200]   So Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy,
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:29.160]   taking energy away from people who can't afford it.
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:30.920]   It's out there buying its own energy
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:32.680]   because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:34.440]   that people really need.
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:37.480]   - So one other criticism from an investment perspective,
[03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:39.480]   from a gambling perspective that people see
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:41.600]   is the volatility of Bitcoin.
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:44.040]   Of course, has been somewhat decreasing over time,
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:48.680]   but what's your answer to the sort of criticism
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:51.400]   that Bitcoin is too volatile, I wanna stay away,
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.360]   it doesn't seem like a safe place for me
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:57.040]   to invest either short-term or long-term?
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:01:58.560]   - There's no denying there's a volatility
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.360]   and there's a high oscillation in the value
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:01.200]   in the short term.
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.400]   So I think the safe way to approach that
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:07.800]   is in terms of position sizing.
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:10.600]   If the volatility bothers you,
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:12.720]   then you're over-invested perhaps.
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:17.480]   So maybe you should reduce the size of your position
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:19.580]   so that the volatility doesn't bother you.
[03:02:19.580 --> 03:02:23.240]   This is the short answer that, you know,
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:26.680]   like stack as much as your conviction
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:28.900]   will allow you to tolerate the volatility.
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:33.360]   And of course, the reason you should try
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:36.160]   and consider tolerating the volatility more
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:40.440]   is the options are you hold fiat assets,
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:43.800]   which only go down stable, you know, relatively stable,
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:45.840]   not a lot of volatility day to day,
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.520]   you know, value of your dollar doesn't change 40% overnight,
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:52.880]   20% overnight or something like that,
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:56.100]   but it does go down reliably, it's gonna go down 40%.
[03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:58.040]   You can count on it, it might take a year,
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:02:59.880]   two years, five years, 10 years,
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:01.760]   compared to the things that you want to buy,
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:05.960]   it's gonna go down by 40% and it's not gonna come back
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:07.560]   and it's gonna go down another 40%
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:09.720]   and then another 40% and then another 40%.
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.720]   So the option really is relatively short term stability
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:18.040]   with long term decline or short term volatility
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:19.800]   with long term rise.
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:22.240]   And so that's another way in which Bitcoin
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.000]   teaches people to have a low time preference
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:24.920]   and think about the long term.
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:29.360]   So stack, accumulate and think of it in the long term.
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.320]   It's a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new.
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.320]   Bitcoin is currently less than 1% of the global money market
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:36.680]   so there's about $100 trillion of money
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:37.780]   out there in the world.
[03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:40.760]   $100 trillion roughly of fiat
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:42.960]   and about $10 trillion of gold
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:44.920]   and Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:48.440]   So one rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin,
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:50.200]   that's gonna show up on the Bitcoin chart.
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:53.000]   You look at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin,
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.200]   you see the buy, you see the news,
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:57.080]   it happens and you see the pump.
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:03:59.920]   Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like Bitcoin,
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:01.240]   you see the drop.
[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:03.480]   But a few years ago, it used to be that
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:07.200]   one random millionaire would cause that pump.
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:09.840]   Now you have to be the richest guy in the world to do that.
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:11.660]   In a few years, you're gonna have to be
[03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:12.900]   the richest country in the world
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:15.000]   to be able to do that to the Bitcoin price,
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.180]   maybe many years, maybe not a few years.
[03:04:17.180 --> 03:04:18.660]   But as Bitcoin grows,
[03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:22.260]   think about it as a liquid pool of money.
[03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:25.340]   Currently it's a small pool next to a much larger ocean,
[03:04:25.340 --> 03:04:26.820]   which is the entire money market.
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:30.580]   And so one person jumps from that to this small pool,
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:32.220]   they can make a big splash.
[03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:36.140]   As the pool grows, essentially the salability increases
[03:04:36.140 --> 03:04:38.860]   and the likelihood of one individual purchase
[03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:43.320]   affecting the price so violently decreases.
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:46.780]   And so over time, as the size of the market increases,
[03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:48.900]   I think we're gonna see the volatility decline
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:49.740]   more and more.
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:52.340]   Ultimately, if you look at gold,
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:54.700]   historically gold has been very, very stable.
[03:04:54.700 --> 03:04:56.340]   It did not achieve its stability
[03:04:56.340 --> 03:04:58.620]   because the central bank was in charge of gold supply
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:00.860]   or because there was a gold committee
[03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:02.900]   that decided how much gold gets produced.
[03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:05.620]   It achieved that stability
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:08.260]   because it became the most salable good.
[03:05:08.260 --> 03:05:09.860]   And so therefore it became the good
[03:05:09.860 --> 03:05:12.860]   that contains the most cash balances in the world.
[03:05:12.860 --> 03:05:14.060]   And the end of the 19th century,
[03:05:14.060 --> 03:05:16.820]   everybody held cash balances in gold
[03:05:16.820 --> 03:05:20.700]   and new production was a tiny little addition
[03:05:20.700 --> 03:05:23.660]   to global production, to the supply.
[03:05:23.660 --> 03:05:26.900]   So that's what made gold the most relatively,
[03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:27.900]   I shouldn't say stable
[03:05:27.900 --> 03:05:29.820]   because nothing is stable in economics,
[03:05:29.820 --> 03:05:31.900]   but relatively it holds onto its value
[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:35.140]   and it's much less volatile than digital currency,
[03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:36.380]   than national currencies.
[03:05:36.380 --> 03:05:41.340]   That's because it has the highest stock to flow ratio.
[03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:43.500]   And that's because its supply
[03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:47.420]   is a tiny fraction of the liquid market.
[03:05:47.420 --> 03:05:48.900]   And as the liquid market grows,
[03:05:48.900 --> 03:05:50.460]   as the size of cash balances grows
[03:05:50.460 --> 03:05:52.960]   and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,
[03:05:52.960 --> 03:05:56.980]   you get only slight changes in value.
[03:05:56.980 --> 03:06:01.100]   So I think as Bitcoin matures, that's going to decline.
[03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:03.900]   So effectively, I think the end game is
[03:06:03.900 --> 03:06:07.460]   Bitcoin is huge.
[03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:08.820]   Bitcoin is worth something like,
[03:06:08.820 --> 03:06:11.780]   I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin
[03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:14.060]   is not just national currencies
[03:06:14.060 --> 03:06:16.620]   and gold's addressable market, but also government bonds.
[03:06:16.620 --> 03:06:17.980]   That's the really big one.
[03:06:17.980 --> 03:06:20.220]   - So how do banks compare to gold?
[03:06:20.220 --> 03:06:23.300]   So you're saying it'll surpass gold with the 10 trillion?
[03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:24.140]   - Yeah.
[03:06:24.140 --> 03:06:25.300]   - What's bonds?
[03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:26.940]   Where's bonds stand?
[03:06:26.940 --> 03:06:28.900]   - So then there's also national currencies,
[03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:30.100]   which are about a hundred trillion
[03:06:30.100 --> 03:06:31.180]   and there's government bonds,
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.540]   which are around $120 billion.
[03:06:33.540 --> 03:06:37.020]   And sorry, trillion dollars, trillion.
[03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:37.860]   - Trillion, sorry.
[03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:38.700]   - Yes, trillion.
[03:06:38.700 --> 03:06:40.420]   - If we were saying billion, we meant trillion.
[03:06:40.420 --> 03:06:41.260]   - Yeah.
[03:06:41.260 --> 03:06:42.820]   (laughing)
[03:06:42.820 --> 03:06:46.260]   - So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?
[03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:48.520]   - I've always held, this is the prize.
[03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:50.140]   This is the main dish.
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:51.820]   Gold is the appetizer.
[03:06:51.820 --> 03:06:52.740]   Bonds are the main dish.
[03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:53.580]   Because bonds have replaced gold.
[03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:54.740]   - It's a hell of an appetizer.
[03:06:54.740 --> 03:06:56.100]   (laughing)
[03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:56.940]   - Yeah.
[03:06:56.940 --> 03:06:59.900]   I mean, bonds have replaced gold in people's portfolio.
[03:06:59.900 --> 03:07:02.540]   People, you remember when we were saying gold was,
[03:07:02.540 --> 03:07:04.100]   you'd hold it as a saving,
[03:07:04.100 --> 03:07:05.580]   as the secure part of your portfolio,
[03:07:05.580 --> 03:07:08.100]   and then you take risk with the equity.
[03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:10.220]   Currently people do that by holding a part
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:11.520]   of their portfolio in bonds.
[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:14.740]   That's the part that they treat as their saving account.
[03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:17.580]   And then the rest they use for speculation,
[03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:18.740]   not speculation, for investment,
[03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:19.940]   within which they take risk.
[03:07:19.940 --> 03:07:21.380]   Yeah, speculation.
[03:07:21.380 --> 03:07:26.380]   And that's stocks and equity and other high-risk assets.
[03:07:26.380 --> 03:07:29.740]   I think Bitcoin is not gonna replace equity.
[03:07:29.740 --> 03:07:30.860]   There will always be equity.
[03:07:30.860 --> 03:07:31.780]   There will always be companies
[03:07:31.780 --> 03:07:34.180]   and people who wanna have equity.
[03:07:34.180 --> 03:07:35.700]   But it'll probably replace a big chunk
[03:07:35.700 --> 03:07:36.920]   of current equity markets.
[03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:39.160]   Because right now, if you want to save,
[03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:40.580]   it used to be that you hold bonds.
[03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:43.440]   Now, if you wanna save, you go into stock indexes.
[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:47.380]   So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk of equity markets
[03:07:47.380 --> 03:07:51.140]   because currently people are using it as saving.
[03:07:51.140 --> 03:07:53.460]   And I think it eats all the bonds.
[03:07:53.460 --> 03:07:56.780]   That's my most ambitious statement.
[03:07:56.780 --> 03:07:59.680]   - The question is the scale of time
[03:07:59.680 --> 03:08:00.620]   that happens across.
[03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:02.340]   But the most important statement you're making
[03:08:02.340 --> 03:08:03.580]   is about trend.
[03:08:03.580 --> 03:08:05.660]   - Yeah, and also, I mean, let's also remember,
[03:08:05.660 --> 03:08:08.940]   currently bonds nominally don't beat inflation.
[03:08:08.940 --> 03:08:09.940]   And in real terms,
[03:08:09.940 --> 03:08:13.380]   they don't come close to beating inflation.
[03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:15.860]   So currently, with bonds,
[03:08:15.860 --> 03:08:19.720]   you're taking on credit default risk to buy a bond
[03:08:19.720 --> 03:08:23.780]   and also getting less money back in real terms.
[03:08:23.780 --> 03:08:26.180]   Well, Bitcoin doesn't offer you returns,
[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:28.220]   but in real terms, it appreciates much more.
[03:08:28.220 --> 03:08:31.340]   And it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it
[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:34.020]   than any company or government.
[03:08:34.020 --> 03:08:36.420]   - So let's make things spicy and ask,
[03:08:36.420 --> 03:08:39.380]   if Bitcoin fails in the long-term future,
[03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:43.220]   as Alt, you just said, economics, volatility,
[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:44.740]   things happen in this world.
[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:48.420]   Well, the human civilization might end in this century.
[03:08:48.420 --> 03:08:50.220]   I hope it doesn't, but it might.
[03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:52.100]   There could be catastrophic events.
[03:08:52.100 --> 03:08:55.300]   If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero,
[03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:57.340]   loses its number one spot,
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:08:58.820]   what would be the reason?
[03:08:58.820 --> 03:09:03.820]   If you're an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:05.820]   and just were to analyze the situation,
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:07.900]   Bitcoin is a pretty new thing.
[03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:10.460]   So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves
[03:09:10.460 --> 03:09:13.180]   together with this new monetary technology
[03:09:13.180 --> 03:09:15.060]   is nearly infinite.
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:17.260]   So if it fails, one of those trajectories
[03:09:17.260 --> 03:09:19.340]   surely involves Bitcoin failing.
[03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:21.340]   What would be the reason?
[03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:23.660]   - I think the most likely reason that it could fail,
[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:25.780]   I don't think this is likely in general,
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:27.300]   but I think it is the most likely
[03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:30.460]   of all the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin
[03:09:30.460 --> 03:09:33.220]   is governments go back on a gold standard.
[03:09:33.220 --> 03:09:38.340]   - So they make, in your view, a better decision
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:41.420]   than the current system, just not the best decision.
[03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:42.260]   - Yeah.
[03:09:42.260 --> 03:09:43.980]   - I thought you would go much darker.
[03:09:43.980 --> 03:09:45.540]   (laughing)
[03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.420]   So that's, okay, interesting.
[03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:50.020]   So maybe because of Russia, because of China and so on,
[03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:52.160]   because of the current war,
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:57.160]   they might reconsider the power that America holds
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:09:59.240]   because of the monetary,
[03:09:59.240 --> 03:10:01.120]   because it being the primary currency,
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:05.520]   and they'll start thinking about going on a gold standard.
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:07.320]   - Yeah, but it would also require the US
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:09.520]   and the Europeans and everybody to want to join
[03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:11.280]   in this system and sing Kumbaya
[03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:15.280]   and play nice with each other around the gold standard.
[03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:17.160]   I think, you know, given that gold already
[03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:19.560]   is about 10 times larger than Bitcoin,
[03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:21.160]   so it has a first mover advantage.
[03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:22.000]   - Yes.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:25.600]   - If governments were to go and peg their currencies
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:28.040]   to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up,
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:33.440]   five, 10x, and it would rise in value a lot more.
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:36.100]   - Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill Bitcoin.
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:37.760]   - No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen.
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:41.360]   I'm saying it's, I imagine, less likely,
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:44.240]   less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:46.520]   because, you know, even with a nuclear war,
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:50.320]   like 90% of the planet is destroyed,
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:52.980]   the 10% continue to run Bitcoin.
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:55.920]   (Lex laughing)
[03:10:55.920 --> 03:10:57.200]   - There's a quote.
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:00.720]   Okay, there's a movement, a community of people
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:03.560]   referred to as Bitcoin maximalists.
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:05.680]   I've seen you referred, at least in the past,
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:10.200]   as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists,
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:12.280]   probably because of your book, you know,
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:14.760]   "Bitcoin Standard," consider the Bible in general,
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:16.760]   you're one of the leaders in this space.
[03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:22.020]   Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:25.180]   that often, or perhaps sometimes,
[03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:26.780]   originates from this community?
[03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:28.940]   - Definitely not.
[03:11:28.940 --> 03:11:31.660]   I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions,
[03:11:31.660 --> 03:11:33.300]   so let's just be clear.
[03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:36.280]   I think the rhetoric of community is,
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:41.180]   I reject this rhetoric because I think it's a way
[03:11:41.180 --> 03:11:45.860]   for kind of political manipulation and subversion
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:49.620]   to try and portray people as part of a community
[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:52.100]   and hold people responsible for other people's actions,
[03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:53.460]   which I think is ridiculous.
[03:11:53.460 --> 03:11:55.700]   So, you know, some guy on the internet
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:57.500]   said something mean to somebody,
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:11:59.420]   and then, this is very common,
[03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:03.460]   and I always try and not get involved in these things.
[03:12:03.460 --> 03:12:05.500]   So some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner
[03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:08.360]   says something to somebody that's very wrong.
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:09.500]   Of course it happens.
[03:12:09.500 --> 03:12:13.420]   Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the world.
[03:12:13.420 --> 03:12:16.660]   And a lot of these, I'd say parasites,
[03:12:16.660 --> 03:12:18.260]   people who don't have anything productive
[03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:21.580]   to do with their life, outrage merchants,
[03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:24.820]   they'll come out and say something along the lines of,
[03:12:24.820 --> 03:12:27.860]   the Bitcoin maximalists are toxic,
[03:12:27.860 --> 03:12:30.340]   they're holding Bitcoin back, and they need,
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:31.420]   and of course it's manipulative.
[03:12:31.420 --> 03:12:34.420]   The point behind it is they wanna get to you,
[03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:36.260]   they wanna get people who are,
[03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:38.220]   not that nobody with 300 followers
[03:12:38.220 --> 03:12:40.340]   who said something silly,
[03:12:40.340 --> 03:12:42.780]   they wanna get the notable people
[03:12:42.780 --> 03:12:44.620]   to basically change their message.
[03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:47.700]   So the idea is, you know, I'm supposed to apologize
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:49.700]   because somebody with 300 followers I've never met
[03:12:49.700 --> 03:12:52.500]   in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner
[03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:55.100]   said a mean word, and then I need to apologize,
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:57.180]   and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric
[03:12:57.180 --> 03:13:00.500]   about other digital currencies, and I need to do that.
[03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:03.620]   So I'm only responsible for my own actions,
[03:13:03.620 --> 03:13:07.020]   and I don't recall regretting anything.
[03:13:07.020 --> 03:13:08.580]   - Okay, well let me push back
[03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:10.220]   or push further into that direction.
[03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:14.300]   Fine, let's leave community aside, labels suck for sure.
[03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:19.300]   But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter.
[03:13:19.300 --> 03:13:24.660]   Even in this conversation, you had some good, strong words
[03:13:24.660 --> 03:13:26.060]   to say about Brookman. - Yeah, I mean,
[03:13:26.060 --> 03:13:29.460]   I've always believed life is too short to mince words.
[03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:32.700]   One day I'm gonna be dead, and on my deathbed,
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:35.140]   I'm not gonna look back and say,
[03:13:35.140 --> 03:13:37.980]   I wish I was a little bit more circumspect
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:39.140]   in expressing my opinions.
[03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:40.860]   I'm far more likely to think, you know what,
[03:13:40.860 --> 03:13:43.340]   I wish I said what I really think.
[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:47.540]   - Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion.
[03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:50.460]   The question is, what is really your opinion?
[03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:55.300]   'Cause you're many people in one.
[03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:56.740]   So there's a person that loves,
[03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:58.300]   there's kindness for other human beings,
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:14:00.100]   there's a person that gets annoyed,
[03:14:00.100 --> 03:14:03.180]   there's a person that enjoys disagreement,
[03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:05.700]   there's a person that enjoys collaboration.
[03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:07.860]   And you can emphasize all of those different things,
[03:14:07.860 --> 03:14:09.380]   each of those different things,
[03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:12.220]   weigh it differently in your online interaction.
[03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:15.100]   There's some aspects of online interaction
[03:14:15.100 --> 03:14:18.060]   that encourages, in different communities,
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:20.540]   online interaction is one community
[03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:24.500]   that encourages kinda derision and mockery and so on.
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:26.780]   So you can choose if you want to engage
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:29.260]   that part of yourself or some other part of yourself.
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:33.340]   Economics is another community that enjoys
[03:14:33.340 --> 03:14:37.620]   being very straightforward about their disagreements,
[03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:38.940]   pretty harsh.
[03:14:38.940 --> 03:14:41.060]   It's fun to watch 'cause it feels like
[03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:43.300]   you arrive at the truth much faster
[03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:44.940]   'cause you tear each other apart.
[03:14:44.940 --> 03:14:49.740]   But that's a choice, that's a deliberate choice.
[03:14:49.740 --> 03:14:53.700]   And I don't want to label an entire community of people
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:56.460]   by its extremes, I don't think you should do that.
[03:14:56.460 --> 03:14:59.140]   But there's cultural characteristics you start to notice.
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:00.780]   When you go to France, it's a certain way.
[03:15:00.780 --> 03:15:04.420]   When you go to Britain, London is different than rural Britain
[03:15:04.420 --> 03:15:08.140]   and New York is different than Iowa.
[03:15:08.140 --> 03:15:09.180]   You start to notice things.
[03:15:09.180 --> 03:15:10.580]   I mean, you don't wanna generalize,
[03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:12.020]   there's all kinds of people everywhere,
[03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:15.100]   but there's a certain way of communication
[03:15:15.100 --> 03:15:16.780]   on crypto, Twitter in general,
[03:15:16.780 --> 03:15:19.260]   but also Bitcoin maximalists
[03:15:19.260 --> 03:15:21.900]   that I even early on received a bunch of heat.
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:23.220]   I was like, what the hell?
[03:15:23.220 --> 03:15:24.060]   (laughing)
[03:15:24.060 --> 03:15:27.040]   So listen, there's definitely a difference
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.980]   when I go to the computer science community,
[03:15:28.980 --> 03:15:30.340]   machine learning community,
[03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:35.020]   it's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.
[03:15:35.020 --> 03:15:39.940]   I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being,
[03:15:39.940 --> 03:15:42.680]   which is asking simple, dumb questions.
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:44.860]   Even when I've already spent years,
[03:15:44.860 --> 03:15:46.300]   sometimes decades with an idea,
[03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:48.160]   I like asking dumb questions anyway.
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:51.980]   Crypto folks punish you for this,
[03:15:51.980 --> 03:15:56.420]   for curiosity, for exploration.
[03:15:56.420 --> 03:15:57.780]   I understand the mechanism
[03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:00.900]   because so many other people come into that community
[03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:04.260]   and they might masquerade as curious,
[03:16:04.260 --> 03:16:06.420]   but really they're trying to inject,
[03:16:06.420 --> 03:16:08.060]   they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin,
[03:16:08.060 --> 03:16:10.900]   there's some scheme, there's some scheme to make money.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:12.460]   And so I understand,
[03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:14.900]   maybe that's just the dynamics of the community by nature.
[03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:18.180]   It's not like you respond appropriately
[03:16:18.180 --> 03:16:22.220]   to the amount of charlatans in the community.
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:25.320]   So if the fraction of charlatans is low,
[03:16:25.320 --> 03:16:27.980]   maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.
[03:16:27.980 --> 03:16:30.860]   And when the fraction of charlatans is high,
[03:16:30.860 --> 03:16:32.740]   you have to be harsher.
[03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:35.020]   Perhaps, perhaps, but--
[03:16:35.020 --> 03:16:36.460]   - I think also the stakes
[03:16:36.460 --> 03:16:38.260]   are extremely high in this situation.
[03:16:38.260 --> 03:16:40.340]   And I think if you don't like Bitcoiners,
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:41.820]   if you think Bitcoiners are toxic,
[03:16:41.820 --> 03:16:43.220]   wait till you meet Fiaters.
[03:16:43.220 --> 03:16:49.100]   The Fiat community has financed world wars and genocides
[03:16:49.100 --> 03:16:53.900]   and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.
[03:16:53.900 --> 03:16:56.540]   The Fiat community, if you wanna use that term,
[03:16:56.540 --> 03:16:57.820]   I don't believe you should,
[03:16:57.820 --> 03:17:00.980]   but I mean, Fiat has destroyed the savings
[03:17:00.980 --> 03:17:02.020]   of pretty much anybody
[03:17:02.020 --> 03:17:03.900]   who's lived through the last 20th century.
[03:17:03.900 --> 03:17:05.780]   Pretty much anybody who's lived through the 20th century,
[03:17:05.780 --> 03:17:07.020]   no matter where you lived,
[03:17:07.020 --> 03:17:09.940]   Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia,
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:12.500]   you've gone through Fiat problems.
[03:17:12.500 --> 03:17:15.540]   You've had hyperinflation, you've had bank confiscation.
[03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:17.340]   There isn't a family in the world today
[03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:21.340]   that hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last century.
[03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:22.740]   They all have a story
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:25.860]   about the inflation and the hyperinflation.
[03:17:25.860 --> 03:17:27.740]   And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this.
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:31.060]   And shitcoins, altcoins,
[03:17:31.060 --> 03:17:36.060]   are essentially Fiat world's last gasp attempt
[03:17:36.060 --> 03:17:39.260]   to try and salvage Fiat,
[03:17:39.260 --> 03:17:40.460]   to try and salvage the idea
[03:17:40.460 --> 03:17:43.540]   that some people will continue to be able to print money
[03:17:43.540 --> 03:17:46.220]   and other people will have to use that money.
[03:17:46.220 --> 03:17:49.020]   You know, this is Twitter, it's a free market,
[03:17:49.020 --> 03:17:50.260]   it's the internet.
[03:17:50.260 --> 03:17:52.380]   You don't have to follow anybody, that's the thing.
[03:17:52.380 --> 03:17:56.900]   Like, so what I find really objectionable
[03:17:56.900 --> 03:17:58.740]   about the people who are so butthurt
[03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:01.300]   always about Bitcoin maximalists is,
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:04.140]   you don't have to click follow on people you don't like.
[03:18:04.140 --> 03:18:06.700]   There are 300 million Twitter accounts.
[03:18:06.700 --> 03:18:09.460]   And if you choose to follow the accounts
[03:18:09.460 --> 03:18:11.260]   that say things that annoy you
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:12.700]   and then complain about the fact
[03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:15.380]   that they say things that annoy you,
[03:18:15.380 --> 03:18:16.540]   I'm sorry, but you're an idiot
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:18.300]   and you don't know how to use Twitter.
[03:18:18.300 --> 03:18:20.540]   Just follow the accounts that you like.
[03:18:20.540 --> 03:18:24.020]   You know, you don't have to be part of this.
[03:18:24.020 --> 03:18:25.340]   You don't have to listen to those people.
[03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:27.180]   You can choose, there are a lot of Bitcoiners
[03:18:27.180 --> 03:18:28.260]   that don't act like this.
[03:18:28.260 --> 03:18:30.420]   You can just unfollow the ones that you don't like and block.
[03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:33.840]   - Since in the past year, man, time flies,
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:36.380]   I've met a lot of them and I enjoy them a lot.
[03:18:36.380 --> 03:18:38.420]   And you build that community of people that you enjoy.
[03:18:38.420 --> 03:18:40.740]   There are lots that communicate in the way you enjoy.
[03:18:40.740 --> 03:18:42.660]   And it's become a meme at this point
[03:18:42.660 --> 03:18:44.820]   that I block with love, I think.
[03:18:44.820 --> 03:18:45.660]   - Yes.
[03:18:45.660 --> 03:18:47.140]   - 'Cause I did not.
[03:18:47.140 --> 03:18:48.620]   - I block very prolifically
[03:18:48.620 --> 03:18:51.200]   and I strongly recommend people continue to block.
[03:18:51.200 --> 03:18:52.540]   I think Twitter is, you know,
[03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:53.780]   you're not gonna get to interact
[03:18:53.780 --> 03:18:55.460]   with 300 million accounts anyway.
[03:18:55.460 --> 03:18:58.540]   So you wanna be constantly curating the experience
[03:18:58.540 --> 03:19:00.460]   by getting rid of people you don't like
[03:19:00.460 --> 03:19:02.380]   and following people that you like.
[03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:03.900]   And that's just how, you know,
[03:19:03.900 --> 03:19:05.700]   after 10 years of using Twitter, you know,
[03:19:05.700 --> 03:19:08.700]   you accumulate a block list, which is very big,
[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:09.860]   which I'm very happy for.
[03:19:09.860 --> 03:19:11.540]   I'm gonna pass on to my children.
[03:19:11.540 --> 03:19:13.980]   (laughing)
[03:19:13.980 --> 03:19:17.620]   - On your deathbed, the grandchildren will gather around
[03:19:17.620 --> 03:19:22.540]   and your grandfather can finally share the full list.
[03:19:22.540 --> 03:19:23.380]   Yeah.
[03:19:23.380 --> 03:19:25.300]   - Again, it's just the Twitter account.
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:26.660]   If it bothers you so much,
[03:19:26.660 --> 03:19:29.900]   ask yourself why it bothers you that some people are so,
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:31.620]   I'm not referring to you obviously,
[03:19:31.620 --> 03:19:34.260]   but I mean the people that are constantly aggravated
[03:19:34.260 --> 03:19:36.540]   about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter.
[03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:38.220]   I just block immediately.
[03:19:38.220 --> 03:19:40.940]   And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy.
[03:19:40.940 --> 03:19:43.220]   And I recommend people do that.
[03:19:43.220 --> 03:19:44.980]   It's really a lot less pathetic
[03:19:44.980 --> 03:19:46.980]   than complaining about strangers,
[03:19:46.980 --> 03:19:49.820]   saying things you don't like, which a lot of,
[03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:52.060]   and of course the reason for it is, you know,
[03:19:52.060 --> 03:19:54.980]   I mean, when I say it's stupid, it's not really stupid.
[03:19:54.980 --> 03:19:56.340]   There's an ulterior motive there.
[03:19:56.340 --> 03:19:59.420]   And the ulterior motive is, hey, I have this shit coin
[03:19:59.420 --> 03:20:01.620]   that I made with five other friends of mine.
[03:20:01.620 --> 03:20:04.700]   And I'd like you to, I'd like to ride your coattails,
[03:20:04.700 --> 03:20:06.980]   Bitcoiners, and I'd like you to please help me promote
[03:20:06.980 --> 03:20:07.820]   this shit coin.
[03:20:07.820 --> 03:20:10.260]   Like this is, I get this practically every week,
[03:20:10.260 --> 03:20:12.540]   whether through email or through Twitter,
[03:20:12.540 --> 03:20:14.940]   where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin.
[03:20:14.940 --> 03:20:17.460]   You know, it's just like Bitcoin,
[03:20:17.460 --> 03:20:19.540]   but it's better because it does this and this and that.
[03:20:19.540 --> 03:20:22.540]   And, you know, basically how can we get you
[03:20:22.540 --> 03:20:24.620]   to promote this shit coin for us?
[03:20:24.620 --> 03:20:27.380]   And being straightforward and forthright
[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:31.340]   is a great productivity hack because, you know,
[03:20:31.340 --> 03:20:33.220]   you just tell those people, no, I'm not interested.
[03:20:33.220 --> 03:20:34.060]   It's a stupid shit coin.
[03:20:34.060 --> 03:20:36.180]   And I wish you a quick and swift failure
[03:20:36.180 --> 03:20:38.660]   before you take a lot of people's money.
[03:20:38.660 --> 03:20:41.780]   And that's what I genuinely think.
[03:20:41.780 --> 03:20:44.260]   - Well, but I'll just be upfront with the fact,
[03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:45.660]   at least for my taste,
[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:49.220]   just labeling everything as a shit coin,
[03:20:49.220 --> 03:20:50.900]   worries me.
[03:20:50.900 --> 03:20:52.140]   So this is my own preference.
[03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:53.420]   It's not a judgment on you.
[03:20:53.420 --> 03:20:56.020]   It's just my own preference that I'm afraid
[03:20:56.020 --> 03:20:57.860]   I'll miss good ideas.
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:20:59.460]   I think when you're, me personally,
[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:01.620]   when I'm too certain about things,
[03:21:01.620 --> 03:21:03.860]   when I'm too tribal about things,
[03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:06.660]   I'll miss actually really strong ideas,
[03:21:06.660 --> 03:21:09.380]   outlier ideas, totally new ideas.
[03:21:09.380 --> 03:21:10.660]   So that worries me.
[03:21:10.660 --> 03:21:15.660]   One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is,
[03:21:15.660 --> 03:21:18.580]   how much is at stake financially,
[03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:20.740]   is that it's less open to good,
[03:21:20.740 --> 03:21:23.580]   actually by design, that it's not changing,
[03:21:23.580 --> 03:21:25.460]   like with the hard forks and so on,
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:28.060]   that there's not a kind of curiosity
[03:21:28.060 --> 03:21:29.920]   about exploration of ideas.
[03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:33.180]   Of course, in some way,
[03:21:33.180 --> 03:21:35.700]   that curiosity can start getting ejected
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:37.500]   when you start talking about other layers
[03:21:37.500 --> 03:21:39.460]   built on top of Bitcoin,
[03:21:39.460 --> 03:21:40.900]   you start talking about applications
[03:21:40.900 --> 03:21:43.300]   or different things like lightning network.
[03:21:43.300 --> 03:21:45.460]   That's where the curiosity can emerge.
[03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:48.060]   But still, that's why with cryptocurrency in general,
[03:21:48.060 --> 03:21:49.420]   I just try to keep an open mind.
[03:21:49.420 --> 03:21:52.420]   And just the shitcoin as a term
[03:21:52.420 --> 03:21:53.500]   is just like a statement
[03:21:53.500 --> 03:21:54.940]   that I'm gonna close my mind to it.
[03:21:54.940 --> 03:21:56.620]   That's the way I hear it.
[03:21:56.620 --> 03:21:59.340]   And, but coming out of your mouth,
[03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:01.060]   'cause you say a lot of other edgy stuff,
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:02.980]   it's just more you having fun.
[03:22:02.980 --> 03:22:03.820]   That's the way I hear it.
[03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:05.180]   But if I said something like that,
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:06.780]   that's, I feel like,
[03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:08.420]   I would feel like I'm closing my mind.
[03:22:08.420 --> 03:22:10.620]   - I mean, let me give you the counter argument to that.
[03:22:10.620 --> 03:22:13.060]   How much time do you spend emailing back
[03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:15.500]   all of these Nigerian Prince email scams
[03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:16.340]   that you know email you,
[03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:17.900]   tell you, "Send me $5,000
[03:22:17.900 --> 03:22:19.820]   "and I'll send you $15 million."
[03:22:19.820 --> 03:22:20.660]   - None.
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:21.500]   - None.
[03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:23.900]   Why are you being closed-minded to all of these great ideas?
[03:22:23.900 --> 03:22:24.740]   - Well, no, but I'm also--
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:25.900]   (Lex laughing)
[03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:26.820]   - You know, maybe one of them
[03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:28.420]   will actually send you $15 million.
[03:22:28.420 --> 03:22:29.860]   - But I don't know if I know the difference
[03:22:29.860 --> 03:22:32.020]   between the Nigerian Prince
[03:22:32.020 --> 03:22:34.140]   and many other people I do talk to
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:35.660]   who are colleagues and so on,
[03:22:35.660 --> 03:22:37.380]   that are also emailing me.
[03:22:37.380 --> 03:22:39.820]   And they're also offering me things,
[03:22:39.820 --> 03:22:42.340]   but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy.
[03:22:42.340 --> 03:22:44.020]   - Yeah, but I mean, the moment that somebody tells you,
[03:22:44.020 --> 03:22:46.420]   "Hey, I'm gonna give you $15 million for nothing.
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:48.500]   "Just if you send me $5,000,"
[03:22:48.500 --> 03:22:49.940]   you know, you're getting something for nothing.
[03:22:49.940 --> 03:22:53.060]   And essentially with all of the digital currencies,
[03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:53.940]   it's the same pitch.
[03:22:53.940 --> 03:22:56.400]   Say, "Hey, you know, come use this thing
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:22:58.220]   "that'll allow you to do things that,"
[03:22:58.220 --> 03:23:00.380]   all of the things that they pretend that they can do,
[03:23:00.380 --> 03:23:01.860]   that can be done with computers
[03:23:01.860 --> 03:23:03.260]   without having digital currencies.
[03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:06.420]   You know, we already have AWS that does cloud computing,
[03:23:06.420 --> 03:23:09.540]   that does everything that shit coins pretend to do.
[03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:11.300]   The only difference is AWS doesn't have
[03:23:11.300 --> 03:23:13.380]   its own monetary system tacked on top of it
[03:23:13.380 --> 03:23:17.460]   to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money.
[03:23:17.460 --> 03:23:19.500]   - But don't you think there's some gray area?
[03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:22.100]   So let me go for the historical record
[03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:23.540]   and let's see if you've changed
[03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:27.660]   as a philosopher, economist, human being.
[03:23:27.660 --> 03:23:29.580]   You tweeted three years ago.
[03:23:29.580 --> 03:23:30.700]   - Oh, well.
[03:23:30.700 --> 03:23:32.900]   - "Anyone who believes proof of stake can work
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:35.700]   "is either one, completely clueless
[03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:38.020]   "at how and why Bitcoin works at all,
[03:23:38.020 --> 03:23:41.460]   "or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword
[03:23:41.460 --> 03:23:44.660]   "to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum."
[03:23:44.660 --> 03:23:49.660]   Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam
[03:23:49.660 --> 03:23:51.660]   and in general, proof of stake?
[03:23:51.660 --> 03:23:55.240]   You're either clueless if you think it's interesting.
[03:23:55.240 --> 03:23:57.280]   - Yeah, no, I still stand by that.
[03:23:57.280 --> 03:23:58.120]   I think the--
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:00.220]   - Would you classify Ethereum as a shit coin?
[03:24:00.220 --> 03:24:03.140]   - For sure, it's the mother asshole
[03:24:03.140 --> 03:24:05.460]   from which the shit coins spring.
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:07.220]   - The royal, the king of Bitcoin?
[03:24:07.220 --> 03:24:08.060]   - Yeah.
[03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:09.920]   I think the key thing is, you know,
[03:24:09.920 --> 03:24:11.380]   the way to think about it, there's another tweet
[03:24:11.380 --> 03:24:13.140]   from a couple of years ago, which is,
[03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:16.260]   essentially proof of work was like the invention of flight.
[03:24:16.260 --> 03:24:17.340]   Like we've got in this machine
[03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:19.860]   and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.
[03:24:19.860 --> 03:24:23.300]   And proof of stake is, hey, we found a great way
[03:24:23.300 --> 03:24:27.860]   to make airplanes cheaper and faster by not making them fly.
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:29.980]   (laughs)
[03:24:29.980 --> 03:24:31.600]   By keeping them on the ground.
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:33.980]   Like the invention of proof of work,
[03:24:33.980 --> 03:24:38.020]   the reason the entire digital currency space exists
[03:24:38.020 --> 03:24:40.860]   is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work.
[03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:43.020]   If Bitcoin was based on proof of stake,
[03:24:43.020 --> 03:24:45.660]   it would have died or been shut down from day one.
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:47.420]   - But that's a hypothesis.
[03:24:47.420 --> 03:24:49.240]   And a lot of people believe that.
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:51.300]   And I think they have a lot of strong support,
[03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:55.900]   but basically proof of work is grounded in physics.
[03:24:55.900 --> 03:24:58.940]   In the real world, the proof of stake is more about--
[03:24:58.940 --> 03:24:59.780]   - It's politics.
[03:24:59.780 --> 03:25:00.860]   It's the Federal Reserve.
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:02.220]   It's exactly what we have.
[03:25:02.220 --> 03:25:03.460]   It's exactly what we have.
[03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:06.860]   It's just a group of people who get to decide the rules.
[03:25:06.860 --> 03:25:09.740]   And it's essentially a system that is, you know,
[03:25:09.740 --> 03:25:11.060]   it's a security, it's a company.
[03:25:11.060 --> 03:25:13.640]   So it's not an innovation in any sense.
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:15.940]   It's a step backward to what we already had,
[03:25:15.940 --> 03:25:18.580]   which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.
[03:25:18.580 --> 03:25:22.580]   Now, the only reason it survives in this,
[03:25:22.580 --> 03:25:24.420]   and the reason I call these things a scam,
[03:25:24.420 --> 03:25:25.860]   and I have no problem with calling them a scam,
[03:25:25.860 --> 03:25:29.500]   is because they fraudulently present themselves
[03:25:29.500 --> 03:25:31.060]   as being decentralized.
[03:25:31.060 --> 03:25:33.180]   They present themselves as just being a different way
[03:25:33.180 --> 03:25:36.540]   of doing decentralization than Bitcoin, when it's not.
[03:25:36.540 --> 03:25:39.140]   It's just they're riding Bitcoin's coattails,
[03:25:39.140 --> 03:25:40.900]   and they're riding the fact that most people
[03:25:40.900 --> 03:25:43.460]   don't quite understand what Bitcoin is and how it works,
[03:25:43.460 --> 03:25:45.580]   to portray themselves as a cheaper, better,
[03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:48.380]   more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does.
[03:25:48.380 --> 03:25:49.300]   It's not.
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:52.660]   It's a less legally accountable way
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:54.900]   of doing what central banks do.
[03:25:54.900 --> 03:25:56.620]   - Right, so, and the basic criticism
[03:25:56.620 --> 03:25:58.080]   is that there's a group of people,
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:25:59.700]   sometimes a very small group of people
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:01.780]   that can control the parameters
[03:26:01.780 --> 03:26:03.340]   of the operation of the system.
[03:26:03.340 --> 03:26:06.820]   So over time, you can't trust,
[03:26:06.820 --> 03:26:09.100]   it's not gold under the mattress.
[03:26:09.100 --> 03:26:10.620]   It doesn't have that kind of hardness.
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:13.020]   - It's not property, and I really, very strongly
[03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:14.700]   recommend your discussion with Saylor
[03:26:14.700 --> 03:26:16.500]   for people who wanna elaborate more on this.
[03:26:16.500 --> 03:26:17.820]   There's a bunch of people in charge,
[03:26:17.820 --> 03:26:20.140]   which means that, you know, legally,
[03:26:20.140 --> 03:26:23.060]   they should be doing this under securities law,
[03:26:23.060 --> 03:26:24.460]   but even as an anarchist,
[03:26:24.460 --> 03:26:26.320]   if I don't wanna care about that,
[03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:28.660]   the technical implication of it is,
[03:26:28.660 --> 03:26:30.220]   this is never going to be adopted
[03:26:30.220 --> 03:26:33.100]   as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet,
[03:26:33.100 --> 03:26:35.460]   because you need something
[03:26:35.460 --> 03:26:37.460]   that enemies can trade with one another.
[03:26:37.460 --> 03:26:39.580]   You can't have something that has a small group
[03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:41.500]   of people in charge, because A,
[03:26:41.500 --> 03:26:44.140]   this small group of people themselves can be corrupted,
[03:26:44.140 --> 03:26:46.940]   and B, they can be coerced.
[03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:49.140]   You know, you can put a bunch of people in a room,
[03:26:49.140 --> 03:26:50.140]   put a gun to their head,
[03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:52.580]   and you can change everything
[03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:53.980]   in any of these digital currencies.
[03:26:53.980 --> 03:26:55.820]   And that's why I think, you know,
[03:26:55.820 --> 03:27:00.820]   you'll find a lot more sympathy among theaters to shitcoins.
[03:27:00.820 --> 03:27:05.580]   The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline
[03:27:05.580 --> 03:27:06.820]   is a very strong one,
[03:27:06.820 --> 03:27:09.940]   I think because it's the same thing.
[03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:11.420]   It's like, I mean, you like the idea
[03:27:11.420 --> 03:27:13.100]   of people being in charge of money,
[03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:14.460]   and you think you're gonna be the one
[03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:15.620]   who's gonna be in charge of money.
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:18.100]   So you see a lot of this phenomena,
[03:27:18.100 --> 03:27:20.500]   and you see the same people that want gold
[03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:23.700]   and don't like central banking, they get into Bitcoin.
[03:27:23.700 --> 03:27:27.540]   - Yeah, so just to actually push back a couple of things.
[03:27:27.540 --> 03:27:29.780]   So one is theater.
[03:27:29.780 --> 03:27:32.760]   It sounds like I'm trying to be a sophisticated Brit
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:34.160]   talking about theater,
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:37.820]   but for many reasons, it's not making me feel good
[03:27:37.820 --> 03:27:38.780]   about that.
[03:27:38.780 --> 03:27:41.980]   So, you know, day by day, things change.
[03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:43.740]   You used to be one of those.
[03:27:43.740 --> 03:27:46.700]   So people evolve, people learn.
[03:27:46.700 --> 03:27:48.140]   People that are supporters of Bitcoin
[03:27:48.140 --> 03:27:51.860]   might eventually become supporters of Ethereum
[03:27:51.860 --> 03:27:53.540]   or go back to supporting fiat.
[03:27:53.540 --> 03:27:54.380]   We don't know.
[03:27:54.380 --> 03:27:56.380]   People evolve for different reasons.
[03:27:56.380 --> 03:28:00.500]   You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened.
[03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:03.820]   So I think every single person sort of,
[03:28:03.820 --> 03:28:07.540]   as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving,
[03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:10.260]   as wars break out and geopolitics change,
[03:28:10.260 --> 03:28:14.140]   as the monetary system is constantly put under stress,
[03:28:14.140 --> 03:28:15.060]   people will evolve.
[03:28:15.060 --> 03:28:17.360]   So we're trying to all figure it out together.
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:20.260]   That's why open-mindedness here, I think,
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:23.060]   for people like me at least, seems essential.
[03:28:23.060 --> 03:28:25.400]   - I know, so I expect you to be answering
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:27.580]   all of the spam emails you get.
[03:28:27.580 --> 03:28:29.620]   - I will, print by print by print.
[03:28:29.620 --> 03:28:32.860]   But no, I don't have a clear understanding.
[03:28:32.860 --> 03:28:34.180]   What is a good investment of my time?
[03:28:34.180 --> 03:28:36.380]   What is a good investment of my money?
[03:28:36.380 --> 03:28:37.900]   That doesn't seem clear,
[03:28:37.900 --> 03:28:42.060]   because things are good at promoting themselves.
[03:28:42.060 --> 03:28:45.260]   I'm not talking about the different kinds of things
[03:28:45.260 --> 03:28:47.320]   like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on.
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:52.320]   I just mean life, like dating, jobs, friendships.
[03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:56.900]   Like everybody's advertising themselves
[03:28:56.900 --> 03:28:59.340]   as a great investment, right?
[03:28:59.340 --> 03:29:02.040]   But you don't know, and you have to keep an open mind.
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:06.840]   And also, I don't, and be sort of self-introspective
[03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:11.840]   about what, how, like biases I operate under,
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:14.860]   and ways I delude myself,
[03:29:14.860 --> 03:29:16.800]   like hallucinations that I'm living under.
[03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:19.880]   It's like breaking out of all these hallucinations.
[03:29:19.880 --> 03:29:22.900]   It's very hard to introspect, thinking like,
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:25.900]   what are the assumptions under which I lived my entire life
[03:29:25.900 --> 03:29:27.900]   that might be actually false assumptions?
[03:29:27.900 --> 03:29:31.060]   That's a really difficult thought process to take.
[03:29:31.060 --> 03:29:32.500]   It's a dangerous one.
[03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:35.300]   It's you, the Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss,
[03:29:35.300 --> 03:29:37.260]   the abyss gazes into you.
[03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:39.160]   It's like Alex Jones talks about this.
[03:29:39.160 --> 03:29:43.660]   I mean, he's living, he's got demons in his head.
[03:29:43.660 --> 03:29:45.780]   So he has like all these conspiracy theories
[03:29:45.780 --> 03:29:46.700]   that it holds in his head,
[03:29:46.700 --> 03:29:48.820]   but it begins to really destroy him.
[03:29:48.820 --> 03:29:51.120]   So it's a psychological burden to carry.
[03:29:51.120 --> 03:29:54.380]   So if you question authority, if you question government,
[03:29:54.380 --> 03:29:57.020]   if you question culture, the way things have been done,
[03:29:57.020 --> 03:29:58.220]   it's really difficult.
[03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:02.320]   And the biases you operate under,
[03:30:02.320 --> 03:30:03.720]   it's really difficult to question them.
[03:30:03.720 --> 03:30:07.640]   So I think like being constantly open-minded
[03:30:07.640 --> 03:30:10.060]   and self-critical, not constantly,
[03:30:10.060 --> 03:30:12.760]   but a little bit every day is important, I think.
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:15.160]   - Yeah, but I mean, you're talking to somebody,
[03:30:15.160 --> 03:30:18.680]   I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine in the West Bank.
[03:30:18.680 --> 03:30:22.200]   I've changed my mind on all kinds of different things.
[03:30:22.200 --> 03:30:25.160]   The fact that I was even open to the idea of Bitcoin
[03:30:25.160 --> 03:30:29.160]   has required an enormous, enormous amount of,
[03:30:29.160 --> 03:30:30.160]   it's a heck of a journey.
[03:30:30.160 --> 03:30:34.760]   So I'd much rather appreciate direct arguments
[03:30:34.760 --> 03:30:37.580]   rather than these kind of general fluffy,
[03:30:37.580 --> 03:30:39.120]   you should be, oh, of course, yes,
[03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:40.040]   you should be open-minded,
[03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:42.600]   but also you come up with conclusions
[03:30:42.600 --> 03:30:44.240]   and you delete spam email sometimes
[03:30:44.240 --> 03:30:45.400]   when you know that it is spam
[03:30:45.400 --> 03:30:46.760]   because you have to move on with your life.
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:48.360]   You can't, there's an opportunity cost
[03:30:48.360 --> 03:30:50.160]   to considering every spam email.
[03:30:50.160 --> 03:30:52.360]   - Well, to me, okay, so I'll just say
[03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:56.360]   from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,
[03:30:56.360 --> 03:30:59.280]   almost like a technical person, mostly,
[03:30:59.280 --> 03:31:01.280]   my understanding of economics is weak.
[03:31:01.280 --> 03:31:05.080]   Proof of stake is not obviously
[03:31:05.080 --> 03:31:10.980]   a weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.
[03:31:10.980 --> 03:31:14.840]   So that's not obvious to me that that goes wrong
[03:31:14.840 --> 03:31:16.440]   and becomes corrupted in the way
[03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:18.160]   that governments get corrupted
[03:31:18.160 --> 03:31:21.680]   because it still seems decentralized.
[03:31:21.680 --> 03:31:24.800]   Now, your criticism of governance is an interesting one,
[03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:26.680]   but if you put that aside,
[03:31:26.680 --> 03:31:29.300]   it still is a decentralized mechanism
[03:31:29.300 --> 03:31:32.680]   and it's more transparent than the mechanism
[03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:33.800]   that governments operate on.
[03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:34.640]   - It isn't.
[03:31:34.640 --> 03:31:35.800]   - This is exactly what the Federal Reserve is.
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:37.680]   The Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system.
[03:31:37.680 --> 03:31:40.720]   The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks.
[03:31:40.720 --> 03:31:42.400]   And so the rules of the Federal Reserve
[03:31:42.400 --> 03:31:44.800]   and the regulations are determined by the ownership,
[03:31:44.800 --> 03:31:45.640]   which is the banks.
[03:31:45.640 --> 03:31:47.800]   So it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is,
[03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:49.560]   but it's too backdoor.
[03:31:49.560 --> 03:31:53.780]   The agreements between the banks and the Federal Reserve,
[03:31:53.780 --> 03:31:55.960]   it feels like a lot of those agreements are made
[03:31:55.960 --> 03:31:58.760]   between individuals that sort of behind the scenes.
[03:31:58.760 --> 03:32:01.160]   It's not hard to, it's opaque.
[03:32:01.160 --> 03:32:03.600]   - Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:05.560]   will take off is if you have a military
[03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:07.280]   to force people to use it.
[03:32:07.280 --> 03:32:08.120]   That's the thing.
[03:32:08.120 --> 03:32:10.360]   Ultimately, there's no way that it's going to take off
[03:32:10.360 --> 03:32:11.760]   on a free market.
[03:32:11.760 --> 03:32:14.080]   And that's why, for all of the bluster
[03:32:14.080 --> 03:32:16.280]   about wanting to move to a proof of stake system,
[03:32:16.280 --> 03:32:19.080]   Ethereum have been saying this since 2014.
[03:32:19.080 --> 03:32:21.040]   It's now been eight years,
[03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:22.880]   they've been talking about it.
[03:32:22.880 --> 03:32:25.420]   We still haven't seen the proof of stake system
[03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:26.460]   operational in the wild.
[03:32:26.460 --> 03:32:28.180]   It's vaporware for all practical--
[03:32:28.180 --> 03:32:30.020]   - Or Dano's proof of stake.
[03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:31.620]   - It's potential.
[03:32:31.620 --> 03:32:33.620]   I mean, you can do it in a centralized way,
[03:32:33.620 --> 03:32:36.760]   but like, can it survive?
[03:32:36.760 --> 03:32:38.820]   Can it last for a long time?
[03:32:38.820 --> 03:32:39.660]   I don't think so.
[03:32:39.660 --> 03:32:43.540]   And I think, you know, it can last perhaps initially
[03:32:43.540 --> 03:32:45.340]   with marketing, with centralized marketing,
[03:32:45.340 --> 03:32:48.420]   you can promote it, but ultimately,
[03:32:48.420 --> 03:32:51.860]   user demand, the people that are not interested
[03:32:51.860 --> 03:32:54.460]   in speculating because they want to get rich on this,
[03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:55.840]   the people that are going to use it,
[03:32:55.840 --> 03:32:58.300]   they're going to want to use it because they can trust
[03:32:58.300 --> 03:33:00.820]   that it is not going to be messed with.
[03:33:00.820 --> 03:33:01.660]   - Yes.
[03:33:01.660 --> 03:33:03.580]   But there's also applications on top,
[03:33:03.580 --> 03:33:06.120]   so Lightning Network, but there's applications on top.
[03:33:06.120 --> 03:33:08.640]   Like, well, the reason I'm interested in things
[03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:11.820]   like Ethereum is you might think it's ridiculous.
[03:33:11.820 --> 03:33:14.120]   I thought it was ridiculous, but NFTs.
[03:33:14.120 --> 03:33:18.180]   You can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin,
[03:33:18.180 --> 03:33:20.460]   but you don't because there's no marketing on Bitcoin
[03:33:20.460 --> 03:33:22.980]   because all of these ideas get promoted
[03:33:22.980 --> 03:33:25.440]   on proprietary shit coins because, yes.
[03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:28.780]   - But there's the network effects of ideas, of applications.
[03:33:28.780 --> 03:33:30.460]   So they just take off for some reason.
[03:33:30.460 --> 03:33:33.420]   And human civilization is such that you get excited
[03:33:33.420 --> 03:33:35.620]   about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing
[03:33:35.620 --> 03:33:38.180]   and they start to get excited and it actually has impact.
[03:33:38.180 --> 03:33:41.580]   Like the fact that NFTs can have an impact on the art world
[03:33:41.580 --> 03:33:46.580]   or the world in general is wild to me, but it worked.
[03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:47.820]   So the question is-
[03:33:47.820 --> 03:33:50.780]   - David Rothkaw has an impact on the art world.
[03:33:50.780 --> 03:33:51.980]   Doesn't say much.
[03:33:51.980 --> 03:33:54.060]   - Well, I'm saying these ideas have,
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:56.260]   we're collective intelligent beings
[03:33:56.260 --> 03:33:59.820]   and we can believe a thing and that has power.
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:02.820]   That has led to major wars and all those kinds of things.
[03:34:02.820 --> 03:34:07.300]   So it's interesting to me that NFTs took hold.
[03:34:07.300 --> 03:34:09.820]   And the question is, is there distributed dApps,
[03:34:09.820 --> 03:34:11.420]   is there distributed apps built on top
[03:34:11.420 --> 03:34:13.900]   of different blockchains that might somehow
[03:34:13.900 --> 03:34:14.940]   transform the world?
[03:34:14.940 --> 03:34:17.700]   You have to kind of keep an open mind to that
[03:34:17.700 --> 03:34:19.460]   because right now it's like,
[03:34:19.460 --> 03:34:21.300]   it's like I'm the same place with that
[03:34:21.300 --> 03:34:23.340]   as I am with like virtual reality.
[03:34:23.340 --> 03:34:26.580]   It's like, all right, this seems like a really
[03:34:26.580 --> 03:34:29.860]   intellectually promising set of ideas here,
[03:34:29.860 --> 03:34:31.580]   but there's something either technically
[03:34:31.580 --> 03:34:33.940]   or socially not quite taking hold.
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:35.500]   Why?
[03:34:35.500 --> 03:34:37.420]   And I don't know what the right answer is.
[03:34:37.420 --> 03:34:39.820]   So with virtual reality, what's the right answer?
[03:34:39.820 --> 03:34:43.940]   Is it just technically the latency is too high
[03:34:43.940 --> 03:34:46.580]   or the games are not good enough
[03:34:46.580 --> 03:34:48.540]   or is it a fundamentally flawed idea
[03:34:48.540 --> 03:34:51.240]   that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it?
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:54.340]   That the physical world is just orders of magnitude better
[03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:57.700]   or a two dimensional display is just as good
[03:34:57.700 --> 03:34:59.180]   as a three dimensional world?
[03:34:59.180 --> 03:35:00.000]   I don't know.
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:01.220]   Why is virtual reality not taking off?
[03:35:01.220 --> 03:35:03.260]   It's been since the 80s, right?
[03:35:03.260 --> 03:35:05.100]   - I don't have strong opinions on it,
[03:35:05.100 --> 03:35:07.700]   on the prospects of the technology.
[03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:10.580]   Personally, I don't wanna ever imagine myself
[03:35:10.580 --> 03:35:12.220]   having something on my eyes.
[03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:14.380]   I'd rather just go out into the real world.
[03:35:15.220 --> 03:35:17.760]   But I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality.
[03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:19.980]   I do have on DAPS and NFTs.
[03:35:19.980 --> 03:35:22.660]   - Yeah, what's your criticism of DAPS and NFTs?
[03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:23.700]   Is it a distraction?
[03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:27.740]   It's a way to sell a flawed technology?
[03:35:27.740 --> 03:35:30.100]   - The problem with DAPS is, I mean, it's just,
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:33.180]   the economics of it makes no sense in the sense that,
[03:35:33.180 --> 03:35:37.820]   you know, currently, if you wanted to run an application,
[03:35:37.820 --> 03:35:41.660]   whatever the application is, you wanna run it on AWS,
[03:35:41.660 --> 03:35:43.020]   you pay a specific amount of money.
[03:35:43.020 --> 03:35:44.820]   You wanna run it on your own laptop,
[03:35:44.820 --> 03:35:48.300]   you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data.
[03:35:48.300 --> 03:35:50.940]   If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger,
[03:35:50.940 --> 03:35:52.220]   where you're distributing the data
[03:35:52.220 --> 03:35:54.740]   over thousands of computers worldwide,
[03:35:54.740 --> 03:35:56.500]   it's infinitely more expensive.
[03:35:56.500 --> 03:36:00.540]   And that's why we haven't seen any of these DAPS take off.
[03:36:00.540 --> 03:36:03.260]   And that's why I've said this many years ago,
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:06.380]   the only working application of blockchain technology
[03:36:06.380 --> 03:36:08.620]   is Bitcoin, because with Bitcoin,
[03:36:08.620 --> 03:36:11.340]   you know, you're with a few hundred bytes of data,
[03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:12.380]   with a few bytes of data,
[03:36:12.380 --> 03:36:17.380]   you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value
[03:36:17.380 --> 03:36:21.300]   from here to China and move it safely and reliably.
[03:36:21.300 --> 03:36:26.300]   So that power, I can't see it being justified
[03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:29.340]   for anything that is not as mission critical
[03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:32.260]   as moving large amounts of value,
[03:36:32.260 --> 03:36:34.940]   which require very little amount of information.
[03:36:34.940 --> 03:36:36.460]   So when you look at all of the buzzwords
[03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:40.380]   that the Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people
[03:36:40.380 --> 03:36:43.140]   like to use, and you know,
[03:36:43.140 --> 03:36:45.140]   if you wanna wonder really why we come
[03:36:45.140 --> 03:36:46.820]   to this kind of aggression,
[03:36:46.820 --> 03:36:48.100]   it's because we've heard all of this.
[03:36:48.100 --> 03:36:50.100]   You know, I've had all of these hucksters come to me
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:51.900]   for years, you know, it's been,
[03:36:51.900 --> 03:36:55.140]   I've had, you know, people in 2016 talk to me
[03:36:55.140 --> 03:36:59.340]   about how Ethereum blockchain technology
[03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:02.860]   is gonna revolutionize real estate deeds in India.
[03:37:02.860 --> 03:37:07.700]   I remember this guy, I'm not gonna mention his name,
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:09.540]   but this guy was, you know, 2016,
[03:37:09.540 --> 03:37:11.260]   and he sold a lot of shit coins
[03:37:11.260 --> 03:37:13.380]   and he made a lot of money off of shit coins
[03:37:13.380 --> 03:37:15.780]   based on all these silly ideas.
[03:37:15.780 --> 03:37:18.980]   We're gonna have blackjack on a distributed ledger.
[03:37:18.980 --> 03:37:20.340]   We're gonna have Indian real estate
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:22.180]   on a distributed ledger.
[03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:25.020]   And it's just, it's concern trolling marketing.
[03:37:25.020 --> 03:37:28.060]   You know, oh, there's a problem with real estate in India,
[03:37:28.060 --> 03:37:32.100]   real estate deeds, blockchain fixes this, buy my shit coin.
[03:37:32.100 --> 03:37:33.900]   And then people buy the shit coin,
[03:37:33.900 --> 03:37:35.700]   Indian real estate isn't fixed,
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:38.500]   and the guy gets rich and they move on.
[03:37:38.500 --> 03:37:41.580]   But I mean, I'm still waiting for a dApp
[03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:42.460]   to actually emerge.
[03:37:42.460 --> 03:37:46.740]   Like, you know, it's, the promise that we keep hearing
[03:37:46.740 --> 03:37:50.980]   is something completely world-changing, world-transforming.
[03:37:50.980 --> 03:37:53.220]   And the reality is not one app.
[03:37:53.220 --> 03:37:56.100]   Like there's one of my good friends, Jimmy Song,
[03:37:56.100 --> 03:37:57.700]   eventually they refused to go ahead with it,
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:38:00.500]   but he wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people
[03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:02.780]   about these dApps.
[03:38:02.780 --> 03:38:04.300]   You know, the Ethereum people are constantly saying
[03:38:04.300 --> 03:38:05.340]   those dApps are gonna grow
[03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:07.460]   and they're gonna have so many applications
[03:38:07.460 --> 03:38:09.140]   and they're gonna have so many ideas.
[03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:11.700]   And the reality is all the apps that work
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:13.060]   are centralized apps, you know.
[03:38:13.060 --> 03:38:16.540]   So there is no Uber on the blockchain,
[03:38:16.540 --> 03:38:20.380]   there is no Twitter on the blockchain,
[03:38:20.380 --> 03:38:21.620]   there is no social media on the blockchain,
[03:38:21.620 --> 03:38:23.220]   because these are businesses
[03:38:23.220 --> 03:38:25.540]   and businesses require a centralized authority
[03:38:25.540 --> 03:38:26.780]   to make decisions.
[03:38:26.780 --> 03:38:28.780]   You can't have it be decentralized.
[03:38:28.780 --> 03:38:30.660]   - Yeah, listen, you're frustrated,
[03:38:30.660 --> 03:38:32.980]   and I could see it over a few years
[03:38:32.980 --> 03:38:37.940]   of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.
[03:38:37.940 --> 03:38:39.940]   - I wouldn't say frustrated, I'm amused.
[03:38:39.940 --> 03:38:43.460]   It's water off my back.
[03:38:43.460 --> 03:38:45.060]   - No, but a man that uses,
[03:38:45.060 --> 03:38:47.900]   and a community that uses the word shitcoin
[03:38:47.900 --> 03:38:50.780]   is a little bit, you call it amusement,
[03:38:50.780 --> 03:38:52.540]   and I think amusement is the way
[03:38:52.540 --> 03:38:55.860]   to deal with the frustration,
[03:38:55.860 --> 03:38:57.660]   it's a channeling of frustration.
[03:38:57.660 --> 03:39:01.660]   Like sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,
[03:39:01.660 --> 03:39:04.180]   the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all,
[03:39:04.180 --> 03:39:07.140]   and that's what you mean by amusement.
[03:39:07.140 --> 03:39:12.140]   But the fact is, there's things like artificial intelligence
[03:39:12.140 --> 03:39:17.580]   for, what is it, how many decades, six, seven decades,
[03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:23.380]   has been off and on promising to change everything.
[03:39:23.380 --> 03:39:28.060]   And it has failed time and time again
[03:39:28.060 --> 03:39:30.300]   to deliver to the promise,
[03:39:30.300 --> 03:39:32.540]   but that doesn't mean there's something fundamental
[03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:34.700]   and really powerful about both the small
[03:39:34.700 --> 03:39:36.500]   and the big things going on
[03:39:36.500 --> 03:39:39.300]   within the actual research and development
[03:39:39.300 --> 03:39:40.340]   within those communities.
[03:39:40.340 --> 03:39:41.940]   There's a lot of exciting developments,
[03:39:41.940 --> 03:39:44.300]   and the scale at which those developments
[03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:46.700]   might actually have a transformative impact,
[03:39:46.700 --> 03:39:48.940]   the timescale, is unclear.
[03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:51.740]   It seems like we're certainly overpromising.
[03:39:51.740 --> 03:39:54.380]   We dream too big and too aggressively
[03:39:54.380 --> 03:39:55.900]   in the AI community, but in a lot of communities.
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:39:57.420]   - Yeah, and I'm happy to give people
[03:39:57.420 --> 03:39:59.820]   the benefit of the doubt when they're overpromising,
[03:39:59.820 --> 03:40:01.700]   but not when they're making their own money.
[03:40:01.700 --> 03:40:03.660]   When you start making your own currency,
[03:40:03.660 --> 03:40:05.660]   then you don't get the benefit of the doubt.
[03:40:05.660 --> 03:40:08.420]   Because if your idea needs you to have a new currency
[03:40:08.420 --> 03:40:10.580]   that you print when Bitcoin is out there,
[03:40:10.580 --> 03:40:12.580]   then I'm gonna go ahead and assume
[03:40:12.580 --> 03:40:13.420]   that you're doing this for the money printing.
[03:40:13.420 --> 03:40:16.260]   - It's a good time to mention that I am actually launching
[03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:19.100]   my new coin called LexCoin.
[03:40:19.100 --> 03:40:19.980]   - You mean shit coin.
[03:40:19.980 --> 03:40:20.820]   - Yes.
[03:40:20.820 --> 03:40:21.660]   (laughing)
[03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:22.500]   - Oh, God.
[03:40:22.500 --> 03:40:24.020]   I'm gonna have to block you with love.
[03:40:24.020 --> 03:40:26.100]   (laughing)
[03:40:26.100 --> 03:40:28.180]   Okay, one thing I wanted to ask you about
[03:40:28.180 --> 03:40:33.180]   is the Fed's, this paper they released in January 20th
[03:40:33.180 --> 03:40:39.180]   on the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC.
[03:40:39.180 --> 03:40:40.340]   What are your thoughts about that?
[03:40:40.340 --> 03:40:43.580]   Is it just another, like, is there pros and cons to this?
[03:40:43.580 --> 03:40:45.180]   Is it at all interesting to you
[03:40:45.180 --> 03:40:47.180]   that they're even considering this kind of thing?
[03:40:47.180 --> 03:40:51.780]   - I used to think that it's just basically a waffle.
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:53.340]   It's meaningless.
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:55.580]   Because as it exists, the dollar
[03:40:55.580 --> 03:40:57.260]   is a central bank digital currency.
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:40:58.100]   - Right.
[03:40:58.100 --> 03:40:59.540]   - And the majority of dollars are digital.
[03:40:59.540 --> 03:41:03.300]   And, but I think the way that over the last couple of years
[03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:04.260]   I've changed my mind on this.
[03:41:04.260 --> 03:41:06.660]   I think this is, there's some serious substance
[03:41:06.660 --> 03:41:08.380]   behind these ideas.
[03:41:08.380 --> 03:41:12.620]   And what they mean effectively is the disintermediation
[03:41:12.620 --> 03:41:15.900]   of the banking system and giving everybody an account
[03:41:15.900 --> 03:41:17.060]   at the Federal Reserve.
[03:41:17.060 --> 03:41:21.340]   This is kind of the really dangerous idea.
[03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:22.940]   And I think this is enormously significant.
[03:41:22.940 --> 03:41:25.900]   Effectively, as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union,
[03:41:25.900 --> 03:41:27.980]   what this is is the return of the Gosbank
[03:41:27.980 --> 03:41:30.780]   on a global scale with modern technology.
[03:41:30.780 --> 03:41:31.860]   So under the Soviet Union,
[03:41:31.860 --> 03:41:34.860]   there was something called the Gosbank or People's Bank.
[03:41:34.860 --> 03:41:36.340]   And that was the only bank in the country.
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:39.500]   And you had an account with the National Bank.
[03:41:39.500 --> 03:41:42.860]   And, you know, if you said something wrong,
[03:41:42.860 --> 03:41:45.980]   your money got terminated from the Gosbank.
[03:41:45.980 --> 03:41:48.460]   Now imagine that combined with the power
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.580]   of digital technology.
[03:41:50.580 --> 03:41:52.420]   And you can see that this could be
[03:41:52.420 --> 03:41:56.140]   an enormously powerful technology really,
[03:41:56.140 --> 03:41:58.900]   because if banks are out of the picture,
[03:41:58.900 --> 03:42:03.220]   then we change the fundamental reality of fiat
[03:42:03.220 --> 03:42:05.900]   as being the creation of money through lending.
[03:42:05.900 --> 03:42:08.860]   And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat,
[03:42:08.860 --> 03:42:10.140]   by government fiat.
[03:42:10.140 --> 03:42:13.240]   So we move to a system in which money is just basically,
[03:42:13.240 --> 03:42:16.620]   it's like we have money that is pieces of paper.
[03:42:16.620 --> 03:42:18.100]   And every time we've had money,
[03:42:18.100 --> 03:42:20.500]   we've had fiat money that was just pieces of paper,
[03:42:20.500 --> 03:42:21.960]   it collapsed very quickly.
[03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:25.220]   With the current system, money is credit.
[03:42:25.220 --> 03:42:28.280]   And the creation of credit is restricted to some point.
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:30.200]   And the creation of credit is self-correcting.
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:32.080]   I discussed this in the fiat standard.
[03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:35.180]   If the central bank allows banks to create too much credit,
[03:42:35.180 --> 03:42:36.040]   that creates a bubble.
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:38.340]   And then there's a collapse in the money supply,
[03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:40.340]   which prevents hyperinflation from happening
[03:42:40.340 --> 03:42:44.220]   because the money creation is self-destructive,
[03:42:44.220 --> 03:42:45.860]   it's self-correcting.
[03:42:45.860 --> 03:42:49.940]   So you end up with an average of like 7% per year increase
[03:42:49.940 --> 03:42:52.900]   because you have 10% for five years
[03:42:52.900 --> 03:42:55.940]   and then you get negative 20% for one year
[03:42:55.940 --> 03:42:57.820]   and it's correcting.
[03:42:57.820 --> 03:43:00.060]   But now if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism
[03:43:00.060 --> 03:43:02.320]   and it's just assigning money directly,
[03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:04.900]   we're likely gonna get much faster inflation.
[03:43:04.900 --> 03:43:08.260]   And I think that's obviously a huge problem
[03:43:08.260 --> 03:43:10.260]   and perhaps the even bigger problem
[03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:12.460]   is the enormous amount of power
[03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:14.180]   that it gives to governments.
[03:43:14.180 --> 03:43:18.020]   It allows them to create an awful dystopia
[03:43:18.020 --> 03:43:22.540]   where you've got your money on your phone
[03:43:22.540 --> 03:43:27.180]   and anything you do is completely supervised
[03:43:27.180 --> 03:43:28.700]   and controlled through your spending.
[03:43:28.700 --> 03:43:31.900]   So they wanna introduce a new lockdown,
[03:43:31.900 --> 03:43:34.060]   then they'll just make your money not work.
[03:43:34.060 --> 03:43:36.980]   Your money's broken today, you can't spend money.
[03:43:36.980 --> 03:43:39.460]   Or you can only spend money in your local supermarket
[03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:40.380]   for the next three months
[03:43:40.380 --> 03:43:42.600]   because you can't leave your neighborhood,
[03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:45.220]   your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.
[03:43:45.220 --> 03:43:48.100]   The Chinese social credit score system
[03:43:48.100 --> 03:43:50.100]   is an example of this.
[03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:53.700]   And I think, I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball.
[03:43:53.700 --> 03:43:55.180]   So I don't know what the likelihood is
[03:43:55.180 --> 03:43:57.420]   of implementing something like this in the US.
[03:43:57.420 --> 03:43:59.980]   I've discussed it with Michael Saylor.
[03:43:59.980 --> 03:44:02.060]   He thinks it's highly unlikely.
[03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:05.340]   He thinks the people who've been pushing this
[03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:07.180]   are very far from the position of power
[03:44:07.180 --> 03:44:10.700]   and the traditional monetary and financial system
[03:44:10.700 --> 03:44:13.660]   is going to survive intact.
[03:44:13.660 --> 03:44:15.540]   I certainly hope so.
[03:44:15.540 --> 03:44:17.980]   I think this would be a terrible thing if it comes to pass.
[03:44:17.980 --> 03:44:19.140]   But I don't think, many people think
[03:44:19.140 --> 03:44:21.420]   that it is something that would undermine Bitcoin.
[03:44:21.420 --> 03:44:24.580]   Like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin is,
[03:44:24.580 --> 03:44:26.180]   well, governments are just gonna launch
[03:44:26.180 --> 03:44:27.620]   their own digital currencies
[03:44:27.620 --> 03:44:28.940]   and then Bitcoin is gonna die.
[03:44:28.940 --> 03:44:31.060]   And I think this is completely missing the point.
[03:44:31.060 --> 03:44:33.580]   People think Bitcoin is important because it's digital.
[03:44:33.580 --> 03:44:34.700]   It's not.
[03:44:34.700 --> 03:44:36.940]   National currencies can be digital.
[03:44:36.940 --> 03:44:39.580]   Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary
[03:44:39.580 --> 03:44:41.420]   and because nobody controls it.
[03:44:41.420 --> 03:44:42.760]   Central bank digital currencies
[03:44:42.760 --> 03:44:44.880]   are likely to be very inflationary
[03:44:44.880 --> 03:44:47.840]   and they're likely to have very strong control at the top.
[03:44:47.840 --> 03:44:50.540]   So if anything, they are an advertisement for Bitcoin
[03:44:50.540 --> 03:44:52.780]   rather than a replacement for it.
[03:44:52.780 --> 03:44:54.100]   - If it's Bitcoin, if it's gold,
[03:44:54.100 --> 03:44:56.980]   it's a way for multiple nations to partake.
[03:44:56.980 --> 03:44:59.620]   So if you were to imagine a future
[03:44:59.620 --> 03:45:03.760]   where we move from the fiat standard
[03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:06.800]   back to the gold standard and then to the Bitcoin standard
[03:45:06.800 --> 03:45:10.380]   or skipping that, going directly to the Bitcoin standard,
[03:45:10.380 --> 03:45:12.220]   what would it take?
[03:45:12.220 --> 03:45:13.980]   Is it gradual, is it immediate?
[03:45:13.980 --> 03:45:17.540]   What are possible trajectories that take us?
[03:45:17.540 --> 03:45:20.540]   Well, basically where the final sort of empirical observation
[03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:22.200]   is that you overtake,
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:26.660]   Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds
[03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:31.660]   in terms of its monetary power in the world.
[03:45:31.660 --> 03:45:34.820]   But like just specifically from a government perspective,
[03:45:34.820 --> 03:45:37.940]   how do we move the United States, China, Russia, India,
[03:45:39.020 --> 03:45:43.340]   European Union to a Bitcoin standard?
[03:45:43.340 --> 03:45:44.820]   - I'm not entirely concerned
[03:45:44.820 --> 03:45:46.220]   about whether governments move or not.
[03:45:46.220 --> 03:45:49.860]   In fact, I'd be very happy for them not to move
[03:45:49.860 --> 03:45:52.700]   as long as possible so that individuals
[03:45:52.700 --> 03:45:56.420]   can accumulate more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap.
[03:45:56.420 --> 03:45:58.560]   - So the people will move
[03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:01.340]   and the governments will catch up.
[03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:03.980]   - Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to.
[03:46:03.980 --> 03:46:05.700]   I mean, the point of the fiat standard,
[03:46:05.700 --> 03:46:07.900]   the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book
[03:46:07.900 --> 03:46:10.060]   and it talks about fiat most of the time,
[03:46:10.060 --> 03:46:13.180]   but it's does so to analyze Bitcoin
[03:46:13.180 --> 03:46:14.020]   and the rise of Bitcoin.
[03:46:14.020 --> 03:46:14.840]   In the final chapter,
[03:46:14.840 --> 03:46:18.040]   I discuss how I think this relationship plays out.
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:24.340]   The way that I tend to think of it is that most likely
[03:46:24.340 --> 03:46:26.580]   what's going to happen is we're gonna have
[03:46:26.580 --> 03:46:28.720]   the kind of financial apartheid
[03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:31.060]   where there's going to be two monetary systems.
[03:46:31.060 --> 03:46:33.620]   One is government controlled
[03:46:33.620 --> 03:46:35.500]   and it comes with increasing amounts
[03:46:35.500 --> 03:46:37.700]   of surveillance and inflation.
[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:39.140]   And then if you want,
[03:46:39.140 --> 03:46:42.820]   you can just opt out of that and get into Bitcoin.
[03:46:42.820 --> 03:46:45.660]   And it's likely going to be difficult for governments
[03:46:45.660 --> 03:46:48.340]   to stop people from getting into Bitcoin
[03:46:48.340 --> 03:46:49.820]   for all of the technical reasons
[03:46:49.820 --> 03:46:52.260]   that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin.
[03:46:52.260 --> 03:46:54.100]   So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,
[03:46:54.100 --> 03:46:56.020]   which is not inflationary
[03:46:56.020 --> 03:47:00.820]   and does not have a central authority that can censor it.
[03:47:00.820 --> 03:47:04.780]   I think gradually is my hope.
[03:47:04.780 --> 03:47:07.300]   And I also think my most likely scenario,
[03:47:07.300 --> 03:47:10.940]   but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks
[03:47:10.940 --> 03:47:12.980]   what they want is what's gonna happen.
[03:47:12.980 --> 03:47:16.260]   I think we're just gonna witness the same relationship
[03:47:16.260 --> 03:47:18.780]   because governments make their currency
[03:47:18.780 --> 03:47:20.700]   so that they can devalue them.
[03:47:20.700 --> 03:47:22.540]   And Bitcoin thrives on that.
[03:47:22.540 --> 03:47:24.100]   And more and more people are gonna learn,
[03:47:24.100 --> 03:47:26.100]   more and more people are gonna find out.
[03:47:26.100 --> 03:47:29.860]   And whether it's through curiosity or self-interest
[03:47:29.860 --> 03:47:32.380]   or through the destruction of the national currency,
[03:47:32.380 --> 03:47:34.820]   all roads lead to Bitcoin.
[03:47:34.820 --> 03:47:36.500]   So more and more people are gonna buy Bitcoin.
[03:47:36.500 --> 03:47:38.020]   The price of Bitcoin is going to go up.
[03:47:38.020 --> 03:47:39.060]   And as it goes up,
[03:47:39.060 --> 03:47:42.060]   Bitcoin becomes a more significant part of the world economy.
[03:47:42.060 --> 03:47:45.380]   And this is something that skeptics don't get.
[03:47:45.380 --> 03:47:48.820]   Like a lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin,
[03:47:48.820 --> 03:47:50.860]   they offer up all of these theories
[03:47:50.860 --> 03:47:53.540]   about why they think Bitcoin can't work.
[03:47:53.540 --> 03:47:56.140]   And then they present it and they think,
[03:47:56.140 --> 03:47:58.060]   they've delivered the knockout blow
[03:47:58.060 --> 03:47:59.660]   as if Bitcoin needs their permission
[03:47:59.660 --> 03:48:01.220]   or the world is going to need their permission.
[03:48:01.220 --> 03:48:02.900]   Well, the reality is people are gonna join Bitcoin
[03:48:02.900 --> 03:48:05.020]   out of greed, out of self-interest.
[03:48:05.020 --> 03:48:08.260]   Number go up technology is really what's going
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:10.020]   to get everybody in.
[03:48:10.020 --> 03:48:14.540]   And that's really the Trojan horse for fixing the world.
[03:48:14.540 --> 03:48:16.900]   Come for the greed and stay for the revolution.
[03:48:16.900 --> 03:48:18.660]   It's gonna keep going up
[03:48:18.660 --> 03:48:21.260]   because people don't like to be poor,
[03:48:21.260 --> 03:48:23.600]   except for most economists and academics.
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:25.780]   People don't like to be poor.
[03:48:25.780 --> 03:48:28.460]   People don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed.
[03:48:28.460 --> 03:48:30.460]   And they care more about their self-interest
[03:48:30.460 --> 03:48:32.580]   than they care about economic theories
[03:48:32.580 --> 03:48:34.620]   about whether this works as money or not.
[03:48:34.620 --> 03:48:37.300]   They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation
[03:48:37.300 --> 03:48:38.540]   and managed to get a bigger house
[03:48:38.540 --> 03:48:40.340]   because they bought Bitcoin five years ago.
[03:48:40.340 --> 03:48:43.740]   They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin
[03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:45.180]   and start buying more Bitcoin.
[03:48:45.180 --> 03:48:47.580]   And this is, I think, an indomitable force
[03:48:47.580 --> 03:48:49.260]   that's going to continue.
[03:48:49.260 --> 03:48:53.940]   And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean
[03:48:53.940 --> 03:48:57.220]   toward an apocalyptic transition.
[03:48:57.220 --> 03:48:59.060]   Fiat's gonna collapse, we're gonna get hyperinflation,
[03:48:59.060 --> 03:49:00.300]   everything's gonna be terrible,
[03:49:00.300 --> 03:49:02.660]   and then we're gonna move to Bitcoin.
[03:49:02.660 --> 03:49:05.420]   And I present the case for why I think
[03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:07.020]   maybe that might not be the case.
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:10.860]   Maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic scenario.
[03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:14.460]   And this was like the conclusion of the Fiat standard,
[03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:16.820]   which is once you realize that mining Fiat
[03:49:16.820 --> 03:49:20.940]   is creating debt, and Bitcoin is allowing,
[03:49:20.940 --> 03:49:22.380]   so in order to have Fiat money,
[03:49:22.380 --> 03:49:23.980]   we need to have people borrow.
[03:49:23.980 --> 03:49:26.100]   We need to have people make loans.
[03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:29.820]   And the problem that Fiat money runs into today
[03:49:29.820 --> 03:49:31.920]   is that if you wanna save money,
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:35.340]   if you wanna hold savings, you have a problem.
[03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:36.740]   Where do you put your savings?
[03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:38.820]   So you put your savings in debt,
[03:49:38.820 --> 03:49:41.020]   in the creation of more bonds.
[03:49:41.020 --> 03:49:42.580]   Wherever you take your savings,
[03:49:42.580 --> 03:49:44.220]   you create a bubble in those things.
[03:49:44.220 --> 03:49:46.020]   And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,
[03:49:46.020 --> 03:49:48.840]   a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing.
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:51.100]   It's because people are looking for savings,
[03:49:51.100 --> 03:49:52.380]   looking for a place where they can save.
[03:49:52.380 --> 03:49:54.780]   All of those things are crappy saving instruments
[03:49:54.780 --> 03:49:58.460]   because they're like copper,
[03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:00.720]   in that there's nothing to stop the people behind them
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:01.820]   to make more of them.
[03:50:01.820 --> 03:50:05.220]   House builders can build more houses.
[03:50:05.220 --> 03:50:06.860]   Governments can issue more bonds.
[03:50:06.860 --> 03:50:09.500]   The crappy fraudulent companies
[03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:12.320]   can list on the stock market and make more stocks.
[03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:14.500]   Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet.
[03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:16.780]   We don't need to keep creating more debt.
[03:50:16.780 --> 03:50:20.560]   We can invest in this asset that is hard,
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:23.020]   and that is internationally liquid,
[03:50:23.020 --> 03:50:25.140]   and that nobody can make more of.
[03:50:25.140 --> 03:50:26.820]   So there is no bubble in it.
[03:50:26.820 --> 03:50:30.140]   There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the supply
[03:50:30.140 --> 03:50:31.900]   and bring the price crashing down,
[03:50:31.900 --> 03:50:34.500]   like with copper and real estate and bonds.
[03:50:34.500 --> 03:50:36.420]   So Bitcoin is the way out.
[03:50:36.420 --> 03:50:38.840]   And this is why I think there's a good case to be made
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:42.540]   for why the fiat authorities might embrace Bitcoin,
[03:50:42.540 --> 03:50:44.420]   because they'll see it is their way out
[03:50:44.420 --> 03:50:49.040]   of this enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in.
[03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:51.060]   Particularly, the richest and most powerful people
[03:50:51.060 --> 03:50:53.220]   in the world, and the richest
[03:50:53.220 --> 03:50:54.540]   and most powerful governments in the world
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:56.300]   are the world's biggest borrowers.
[03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:57.820]   They're the ones in a lot of debt.
[03:50:57.820 --> 03:51:02.820]   So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that debt
[03:51:02.820 --> 03:51:05.420]   as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset
[03:51:05.420 --> 03:51:10.420]   that continues to appreciate is the peaceful way
[03:51:10.420 --> 03:51:12.960]   that we wind down the fiat Ponzi, I think.
[03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:15.300]   You could see it being like a political,
[03:51:15.300 --> 03:51:18.240]   part of a political platform for future people
[03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:21.880]   that run for president, those kinds of things to address.
[03:51:21.880 --> 03:51:26.100]   Obviously, it's not just for the powerful and the rich.
[03:51:26.100 --> 03:51:28.220]   The people are bothered by the debt.
[03:51:28.220 --> 03:51:30.220]   The people are bothered by everything
[03:51:30.220 --> 03:51:31.900]   that you described with fiat.
[03:51:31.900 --> 03:51:35.460]   And if you wanna sell yourself in a democracy
[03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:38.540]   as a good leader, you might want to make that part
[03:51:38.540 --> 03:51:39.660]   of the platform.
[03:51:39.660 --> 03:51:41.420]   You mentioned you know Michael Malice.
[03:51:41.420 --> 03:51:46.340]   He just texted me asking me to ask you,
[03:51:46.340 --> 03:51:49.020]   what do you like best about Michael Malice?
[03:51:49.020 --> 03:51:52.820]   If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour
[03:51:52.820 --> 03:51:54.980]   talking about the genius of Michael Malice.
[03:51:55.260 --> 03:51:58.420]   What do you like, where does one even start?
[03:51:58.420 --> 03:52:00.180]   Well, obviously the haircut first.
[03:52:00.180 --> 03:52:03.980]   - Yeah, he just gets sexier with age, that's for sure.
[03:52:03.980 --> 03:52:04.820]   That's good.
[03:52:04.820 --> 03:52:05.660]   - Yes.
[03:52:05.660 --> 03:52:10.660]   - Do you, you know, his ideas, his trolling and humor,
[03:52:10.660 --> 03:52:12.980]   have you gotten a chance to interact with him?
[03:52:12.980 --> 03:52:16.380]   - Yes, yes, I've met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago
[03:52:16.380 --> 03:52:17.380]   in New York.
[03:52:17.380 --> 03:52:19.940]   I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York.
[03:52:19.940 --> 03:52:21.140]   I met him a couple of times.
[03:52:21.140 --> 03:52:24.460]   There was a bunch of anarchists in New York
[03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:27.340]   used to throw a happy hour once a month.
[03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:30.820]   It was called the High Time Preference Hoppe Hour
[03:52:30.820 --> 03:52:34.020]   in honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe.
[03:52:34.020 --> 03:52:35.460]   So I met him there a couple of times
[03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:39.340]   and we followed each other on Twitter for a while.
[03:52:39.340 --> 03:52:41.260]   - Is there interesting that you're aware
[03:52:41.260 --> 03:52:43.960]   of philosophical differences in your world views?
[03:52:43.960 --> 03:52:47.380]   - No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.
[03:52:47.380 --> 03:52:52.460]   I think the difference is mainly that he spends a lot of time
[03:52:52.460 --> 03:52:55.380]   focusing on American politics and American pop culture,
[03:52:55.380 --> 03:52:57.860]   which I don't pay much attention to, I guess.
[03:52:57.860 --> 03:53:00.420]   - So you look more at the monetary system,
[03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:02.700]   the economics of it all, and just the history,
[03:53:02.700 --> 03:53:04.980]   and just looking at it, zooming out
[03:53:04.980 --> 03:53:07.340]   at the big picture of it all.
[03:53:07.340 --> 03:53:08.860]   Although recently he's working on a book
[03:53:08.860 --> 03:53:11.680]   called "The White Pill" and he's been,
[03:53:11.680 --> 03:53:14.380]   every time I see him, I mean,
[03:53:14.380 --> 03:53:18.780]   he's in some dark aspect of the 20th century.
[03:53:18.780 --> 03:53:22.140]   He's just like, "I just finished writing about Hollydom."
[03:53:22.140 --> 03:53:25.460]   As you might imagine, he's not taking much, I believe,
[03:53:25.460 --> 03:53:27.860]   of a monetary perspective on things.
[03:53:27.860 --> 03:53:30.580]   His book, his writing, at least for time,
[03:53:30.580 --> 03:53:34.220]   has a kind of philosophical ideology perspective
[03:53:34.220 --> 03:53:37.100]   that's outside of the monetary system.
[03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:41.580]   But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked.
[03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:43.740]   - Yeah, and I don't think he would disagree.
[03:53:43.740 --> 03:53:44.580]   - He would.
[03:53:44.580 --> 03:53:49.140]   But a book has to be, can only be so long, I suppose.
[03:53:49.140 --> 03:53:52.660]   It can only focus on so many things.
[03:53:52.660 --> 03:53:56.180]   - If you can put on your wise sage hat
[03:53:56.180 --> 03:53:58.540]   and give some advice to young people,
[03:53:58.540 --> 03:54:01.980]   I mean, the past four hours have been a kind of advice,
[03:54:01.980 --> 03:54:05.300]   but if you can focus, and if somebody in high school
[03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:09.380]   or college is thinking about what to do with their career,
[03:54:09.380 --> 03:54:11.660]   can have a successful career, or to have a life
[03:54:11.660 --> 03:54:13.620]   they can be proud of, what would you tell them?
[03:54:13.620 --> 03:54:15.580]   - I'd say probably the most important advice
[03:54:15.580 --> 03:54:19.060]   that I would give is to find a way to give value
[03:54:19.060 --> 03:54:20.100]   to other people.
[03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:21.620]   This is really the key thing.
[03:54:21.620 --> 03:54:23.620]   You need to wake up every morning
[03:54:23.620 --> 03:54:25.580]   and figure out how to serve others.
[03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:30.140]   This is the key to everything you want in life.
[03:54:30.140 --> 03:54:32.420]   Everything that you want is on the other side
[03:54:32.420 --> 03:54:34.380]   of you serving others.
[03:54:34.380 --> 03:54:37.460]   So figure out how you can serve others in a good way,
[03:54:37.460 --> 03:54:39.540]   how you can do it in a way that they value,
[03:54:39.540 --> 03:54:42.260]   and you've got an incredible mechanism
[03:54:42.260 --> 03:54:44.980]   for figuring that out, which is the market.
[03:54:44.980 --> 03:54:47.220]   Go out there and do things for other people.
[03:54:48.420 --> 03:54:49.740]   - The market will tell you.
[03:54:49.740 --> 03:54:51.580]   - The market will tell you, exactly.
[03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:53.500]   If you're young, you have the enormous advantage
[03:54:53.500 --> 03:54:56.820]   of being able to make mistakes, essentially,
[03:54:56.820 --> 03:54:58.140]   and learn from them.
[03:54:58.140 --> 03:55:02.140]   So go out there, do things of value for others,
[03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:05.580]   figuring out how you can do something that,
[03:55:05.580 --> 03:55:07.940]   what is it that you can do that contributes
[03:55:07.940 --> 03:55:10.140]   the most value to other people's lives?
[03:55:10.140 --> 03:55:13.220]   And increasingly, I think with the modern technology,
[03:55:13.220 --> 03:55:15.540]   this is increasingly becoming online,
[03:55:15.540 --> 03:55:18.820]   and it's, I think you should consider
[03:55:18.820 --> 03:55:21.380]   how you can create value online,
[03:55:21.380 --> 03:55:25.300]   because that scales beyond anything that you can do
[03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:27.900]   in the physical world, in a very, very,
[03:55:27.900 --> 03:55:29.300]   well, maybe not beyond, obviously,
[03:55:29.300 --> 03:55:33.180]   there are profitable businesses in the physical world,
[03:55:33.180 --> 03:55:36.620]   but I think online is enormous potential,
[03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:39.060]   and coding, I think, is enormously powerful.
[03:55:39.060 --> 03:55:41.060]   I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend
[03:55:41.060 --> 03:55:44.140]   people get into learning how to code,
[03:55:44.140 --> 03:55:46.380]   and I think it's probably the thing
[03:55:46.380 --> 03:55:48.700]   that carries the most power.
[03:55:48.700 --> 03:55:51.540]   So initially, we were working with our hands.
[03:55:51.540 --> 03:55:52.780]   We started working with machines.
[03:55:52.780 --> 03:55:54.500]   Machines are much more productive.
[03:55:54.500 --> 03:55:57.580]   Well, code is an even higher level of productivity,
[03:55:57.580 --> 03:56:00.900]   where you basically program the machines to produce things.
[03:56:00.900 --> 03:56:05.220]   So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard,
[03:56:05.220 --> 03:56:07.420]   and you can move millions of machines
[03:56:07.420 --> 03:56:09.220]   around the world in certain ways.
[03:56:09.220 --> 03:56:11.300]   So it carries an enormous amount of value.
[03:56:11.300 --> 03:56:15.220]   I think I always tell all young people to learn to code.
[03:56:15.220 --> 03:56:16.380]   It's the best thing.
[03:56:16.380 --> 03:56:19.140]   I used to tell it to my students when I was at university.
[03:56:19.140 --> 03:56:21.620]   Tell them to drop out and go learn to code.
[03:56:21.620 --> 03:56:23.660]   It's probably a better use of their time and money.
[03:56:23.660 --> 03:56:25.420]   - Well, you could probably do both.
[03:56:25.420 --> 03:56:26.260]   - Yeah.
[03:56:26.260 --> 03:56:28.060]   - University has an interesting function.
[03:56:28.060 --> 03:56:30.420]   I mean, probably you and I have different perspective
[03:56:30.420 --> 03:56:32.220]   on this, probably has to do with a little bit
[03:56:32.220 --> 03:56:35.740]   of a different journey in terms of fields,
[03:56:35.740 --> 03:56:38.380]   'cause I'm so, I've stayed engineering-focused
[03:56:38.380 --> 03:56:40.380]   for a long time, and there's less,
[03:56:40.380 --> 03:56:41.780]   some of the troubles you might highlight
[03:56:41.780 --> 03:56:44.220]   in the education system, there's less troubles
[03:56:44.220 --> 03:56:48.580]   of that kind in engineering, 'cause math hasn't changed
[03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:50.540]   for a long time, so.
[03:56:50.540 --> 03:56:51.380]   - Yeah.
[03:56:51.380 --> 03:56:53.340]   - A lot of it is just doing hard things,
[03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:55.380]   being forced to do hard things,
[03:56:55.380 --> 03:56:57.700]   and becoming a bit of a generalist,
[03:56:57.700 --> 03:57:00.580]   while on the side, you're also becoming a specialist
[03:57:00.580 --> 03:57:04.340]   based on your own passion, driven by your own passion.
[03:57:04.340 --> 03:57:06.700]   So school, at least high school,
[03:57:06.700 --> 03:57:07.620]   I don't know about the university,
[03:57:07.660 --> 03:57:11.420]   but high school, that's a really nice,
[03:57:11.420 --> 03:57:13.580]   one of the only times in your life,
[03:57:13.580 --> 03:57:17.260]   at least in my life, I was forced,
[03:57:17.260 --> 03:57:20.820]   but now I see, given the opportunity
[03:57:20.820 --> 03:57:24.460]   to spend my entire day learning broadly.
[03:57:24.460 --> 03:57:25.980]   And that's something, I don't know,
[03:57:25.980 --> 03:57:28.020]   the way time works, it just runs away from you,
[03:57:28.020 --> 03:57:29.220]   and you never really get a chance
[03:57:29.220 --> 03:57:33.740]   to learn quite that broadly again.
[03:57:33.740 --> 03:57:35.340]   That's the curse of specialization,
[03:57:35.340 --> 03:57:39.220]   is you never get a chance to study biology, chemistry,
[03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:42.740]   if you're a physicist, time runs away from you.
[03:57:42.740 --> 03:57:46.980]   So enjoy the broad education,
[03:57:46.980 --> 03:57:48.780]   but yeah, like you said,
[03:57:48.780 --> 03:57:52.240]   find the things that valued by the market.
[03:57:52.240 --> 03:57:56.220]   And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff,
[03:57:56.220 --> 03:57:58.540]   so that's also a way to get happiness.
[03:57:58.540 --> 03:58:00.580]   - Yeah, and I'll also add that the horse
[03:58:00.580 --> 03:58:01.820]   that I like to whip all the time
[03:58:01.820 --> 03:58:04.260]   is the low time preference aspect of things,
[03:58:04.260 --> 03:58:06.100]   saving with Bitcoin.
[03:58:06.100 --> 03:58:08.660]   So I think my advice to young people is,
[03:58:08.660 --> 03:58:11.140]   when you're young, you think of the world
[03:58:11.140 --> 03:58:13.760]   in the very short term generally.
[03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:15.860]   You're focused on the present,
[03:58:15.860 --> 03:58:17.420]   and you think that everything that's happening
[03:58:17.420 --> 03:58:18.980]   in the present is the most important thing
[03:58:18.980 --> 03:58:21.700]   that's ever gonna happen in the history of humanity.
[03:58:21.700 --> 03:58:23.660]   Lower your time preference, think about the future,
[03:58:23.660 --> 03:58:25.660]   think further down the line,
[03:58:25.660 --> 03:58:28.380]   think about the consequences of the things you do,
[03:58:28.380 --> 03:58:29.220]   and then what?
[03:58:29.220 --> 03:58:31.160]   And so you do this now, it feels good today,
[03:58:31.160 --> 03:58:33.540]   but then what happens tomorrow?
[03:58:33.540 --> 03:58:35.300]   You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself,
[03:58:35.300 --> 03:58:37.380]   well, think about the hangover.
[03:58:37.380 --> 03:58:40.300]   But more in long term, think about the implication
[03:58:40.300 --> 03:58:42.340]   of living this kind of life.
[03:58:42.340 --> 03:58:44.300]   Think about every decision that you make,
[03:58:44.300 --> 03:58:46.100]   the long term implication of it.
[03:58:46.100 --> 03:58:49.580]   And part of that is Bitcoin, part of that is save in Bitcoin.
[03:58:49.580 --> 03:58:54.520]   I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the long term.
[03:58:54.520 --> 03:58:56.380]   Don't buy Bitcoin for the short term,
[03:58:56.380 --> 03:58:59.100]   don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it.
[03:58:59.100 --> 03:59:00.780]   You don't put your savings in Bitcoin today
[03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:04.220]   so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.
[03:59:04.220 --> 03:59:07.580]   Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin
[03:59:07.580 --> 03:59:12.580]   for another five, 10 years or so, at least four years
[03:59:12.580 --> 03:59:13.980]   is what I recommend for people.
[03:59:13.980 --> 03:59:15.980]   So keep a low time preference,
[03:59:15.980 --> 03:59:18.340]   focus on the future and save in Bitcoin.
[03:59:18.340 --> 03:59:21.300]   - And learn about how to buy Bitcoin,
[03:59:21.300 --> 03:59:23.420]   how to learn about all this technology.
[03:59:23.420 --> 03:59:24.780]   Part of this is this conversation,
[03:59:24.780 --> 03:59:26.620]   but there's so much awesome material out there.
[03:59:26.620 --> 03:59:28.240]   And thank you, by the way,
[03:59:28.240 --> 03:59:30.520]   for this gift of a hardware wallet.
[03:59:30.520 --> 03:59:31.360]   - Nice.
[03:59:31.360 --> 03:59:33.860]   - So you should definitely invest in it yourself.
[03:59:33.860 --> 03:59:36.740]   And what would you call this?
[03:59:36.740 --> 03:59:37.580]   These are--
[03:59:37.580 --> 03:59:38.420]   - Open dimes.
[03:59:38.420 --> 03:59:39.380]   - Open dimes, yeah.
[03:59:39.380 --> 03:59:41.780]   So this is like USB that you can,
[03:59:41.780 --> 03:59:44.100]   like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.
[03:59:44.100 --> 03:59:46.780]   - Yeah, so you don't have to worry about
[03:59:46.780 --> 03:59:47.740]   knowing the password.
[03:59:47.740 --> 03:59:50.420]   It contains the password within it and it's tamper-proof.
[03:59:50.420 --> 03:59:52.260]   So you can save the Bitcoin on it and--
[03:59:52.260 --> 03:59:54.380]   - So when the apocalypse comes,
[03:59:54.380 --> 03:59:57.860]   you need the value to be stored on an actual thing
[03:59:57.860 --> 03:59:59.860]   that you can have in your physical possession.
[03:59:59.860 --> 04:00:02.220]   - Yeah, that's exactly what this is.
[04:00:02.220 --> 04:00:04.660]   You've had a heck of a life.
[04:00:04.660 --> 04:00:07.900]   You've been in a bunch of places in this world.
[04:00:07.900 --> 04:00:08.940]   - A lot of places.
[04:00:08.940 --> 04:00:12.820]   - Life is not easy in some of those places.
[04:00:12.820 --> 04:00:17.260]   What has been, if we can take a step to maybe
[04:00:17.260 --> 04:00:19.300]   a bit of a dark step for a short time,
[04:00:19.300 --> 04:00:23.720]   what has been maybe darkest time, period,
[04:00:23.720 --> 04:00:26.020]   place you've ever gone in your mind,
[04:00:26.020 --> 04:00:29.500]   a dark period of your life, a struggle
[04:00:29.500 --> 04:00:32.180]   you had to overcome, you had to survive?
[04:00:32.180 --> 04:00:36.580]   - Well, I'm Palestinian, so that is the tragedy of my life.
[04:00:36.580 --> 04:00:37.960]   I'm Palestinian-Jordanian.
[04:00:37.960 --> 04:00:43.900]   My family's suffered a lot because of this historically.
[04:00:43.900 --> 04:00:47.020]   I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank.
[04:00:47.020 --> 04:00:50.480]   It wasn't ideal to see that.
[04:00:50.480 --> 04:00:54.220]   People like to think of it as this intractable conflict
[04:00:54.220 --> 04:00:55.800]   between two bitter enemies,
[04:00:55.840 --> 04:00:59.800]   but the reality of the matter is that it's not.
[04:00:59.800 --> 04:01:02.020]   A foreign ideology came in with the idea
[04:01:02.020 --> 04:01:04.480]   that this country needs to be occupied
[04:01:04.480 --> 04:01:06.840]   by people from only one religion,
[04:01:06.840 --> 04:01:09.720]   and the existing population, which,
[04:01:09.720 --> 04:01:12.600]   I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine historically,
[04:01:12.600 --> 04:01:15.040]   and at the turn of the 20th century,
[04:01:15.040 --> 04:01:16.920]   they were only 10% of the population,
[04:01:16.920 --> 04:01:19.600]   but then with the birth of fiat money,
[04:01:19.600 --> 04:01:21.880]   incidentally, the link with all of this
[04:01:21.880 --> 04:01:25.680]   is that when the Bank of England went off gold,
[04:01:25.680 --> 04:01:28.200]   a big reason why they were able to pull that off
[04:01:28.200 --> 04:01:31.040]   was that the Rothschild banking family supported them,
[04:01:31.040 --> 04:01:33.480]   and in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine.
[04:01:33.480 --> 04:01:37.640]   The Balfour Declaration was written
[04:01:37.640 --> 04:01:42.640]   by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,
[04:01:42.640 --> 04:01:47.600]   telling them that they'd like to make Palestine
[04:01:47.600 --> 04:01:49.480]   a homeland for Jews.
[04:01:49.480 --> 04:01:51.880]   So obviously, that's not very convenient
[04:01:51.880 --> 04:01:53.320]   for people who are not Jewish,
[04:01:53.320 --> 04:01:54.680]   for whom that is a homeland,
[04:01:54.680 --> 04:01:59.680]   and the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle
[04:01:59.680 --> 04:02:01.360]   if you happen to not be Jewish,
[04:02:01.360 --> 04:02:03.680]   and obviously, you know,
[04:02:03.680 --> 04:02:05.700]   obviously, Palestinians have done all kinds of things,
[04:02:05.700 --> 04:02:06.680]   trying to fight back,
[04:02:06.680 --> 04:02:09.080]   and they've done all kinds of wrong things,
[04:02:09.080 --> 04:02:10.620]   but I don't think you can escape
[04:02:10.620 --> 04:02:12.860]   the fundamental reality underlying this,
[04:02:12.860 --> 04:02:15.040]   which is that if you're not Jewish,
[04:02:15.040 --> 04:02:18.120]   you are being moved out of the land,
[04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:21.120]   and so it's happened in 1947, '48,
[04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:24.640]   it happened in 1976, '67,
[04:02:24.640 --> 04:02:26.520]   more land was taken over by Israel,
[04:02:26.520 --> 04:02:29.000]   now you see it with the settlements.
[04:02:29.000 --> 04:02:31.080]   You know, if you ignore the day-to-day headlines,
[04:02:31.080 --> 04:02:33.120]   and you ignore the media propaganda,
[04:02:33.120 --> 04:02:34.760]   and you ignore all of this,
[04:02:34.760 --> 04:02:36.600]   there's a very clear thing that is happening,
[04:02:36.600 --> 04:02:41.600]   which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology
[04:02:41.600 --> 04:02:43.920]   that believes this land needs to be owned
[04:02:43.920 --> 04:02:45.480]   by people from one religion,
[04:02:45.480 --> 04:02:47.840]   and everybody else is being kicked out,
[04:02:47.840 --> 04:02:52.600]   and so that is the tragedy of my life,
[04:02:52.600 --> 04:02:55.920]   and my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon,
[04:02:55.920 --> 04:02:59.520]   and her family was evicted from Jaffa,
[04:02:59.520 --> 04:03:02.880]   which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.
[04:03:02.880 --> 04:03:05.480]   They still have their homes in Jaffa,
[04:03:05.480 --> 04:03:06.480]   their homes are being,
[04:03:06.480 --> 04:03:08.120]   you know, they got kicked out of their homes,
[04:03:08.120 --> 04:03:09.720]   and their lands, and their property,
[04:03:09.720 --> 04:03:11.600]   they became refugees in Lebanon.
[04:03:11.600 --> 04:03:13.120]   So my children, you know,
[04:03:13.120 --> 04:03:14.920]   and it's an ongoing tragedy,
[04:03:14.920 --> 04:03:16.400]   it's not something that is,
[04:03:17.400 --> 04:03:20.920]   a lot of the people that think of it as,
[04:03:20.920 --> 04:03:22.760]   you know, they think Palestinians are just out there
[04:03:22.760 --> 04:03:25.120]   to get Israelis because they hate them,
[04:03:25.120 --> 04:03:27.760]   but it's an inescapable tragedy.
[04:03:27.760 --> 04:03:29.200]   I don't have a home anywhere.
[04:03:29.200 --> 04:03:31.600]   Is there an escape from this tragedy
[04:03:31.600 --> 04:03:33.520]   in the future that you see?
[04:03:33.520 --> 04:03:36.640]   If you zoom out across the scale of decades,
[04:03:36.640 --> 04:03:39.960]   will we see,
[04:03:39.960 --> 04:03:44.360]   I hesitate to say peace,
[04:03:44.360 --> 04:03:49.360]   but a significant decrease in human suffering
[04:03:49.360 --> 04:03:52.160]   in this part of the region?
[04:03:52.160 --> 04:03:53.360]   - I certainly hope so.
[04:03:53.360 --> 04:03:58.120]   And I think, you know, my interest in Bitcoin comes from,
[04:03:58.120 --> 04:04:02.000]   came from a place of desperation with the situation there.
[04:04:02.000 --> 04:04:04.920]   Traditional politics is a dead end.
[04:04:04.920 --> 04:04:08.080]   I don't see what I can be doing
[04:04:08.080 --> 04:04:11.880]   to make things better there using traditional politics.
[04:04:11.880 --> 04:04:14.600]   And I think a good friend of mine, Pierre Rochard,
[04:04:14.600 --> 04:04:16.120]   you may know him on Twitter,
[04:04:16.120 --> 04:04:18.800]   one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin, in my opinion,
[04:04:18.800 --> 04:04:21.000]   he told me his theory is that Bitcoin
[04:04:21.000 --> 04:04:22.560]   is gonna bring peace to the Middle East
[04:04:22.560 --> 04:04:24.080]   because land is a shit coin.
[04:04:24.080 --> 04:04:25.960]   (laughing)
[04:04:25.960 --> 04:04:28.160]   - And land is a shit coin, I love it.
[04:04:28.160 --> 04:04:30.040]   - And I think he's got a very good point there,
[04:04:30.040 --> 04:04:33.440]   that this fixation with land and the bitterness
[04:04:33.440 --> 04:04:38.440]   with which people have to live land is likely to decline
[04:04:38.440 --> 04:04:40.800]   when people are gonna have a form of property
[04:04:40.800 --> 04:04:42.240]   that they can keep.
[04:04:42.240 --> 04:04:45.000]   And so hopefully that will help in one way.
[04:04:45.000 --> 04:04:47.680]   And of course, the more obvious way is that
[04:04:47.680 --> 04:04:50.080]   this is a conflict of governments
[04:04:50.080 --> 04:04:52.960]   and it's a conflict that is financed by fiat.
[04:04:52.960 --> 04:04:56.560]   From day one, you know, the entirely insane notion
[04:04:56.560 --> 04:05:01.560]   that you could build a national, an ethnic homeland.
[04:05:01.560 --> 04:05:03.880]   And of course, you know, this is the early 20th century.
[04:05:03.880 --> 04:05:08.880]   So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place
[04:05:09.000 --> 04:05:11.720]   where all these other ethnic nationalisms of Europe
[04:05:11.720 --> 04:05:14.640]   were emerging and we saw how well,
[04:05:14.640 --> 04:05:16.520]   how horribly these worked out.
[04:05:16.520 --> 04:05:19.280]   But the idea that you could, you know,
[04:05:19.280 --> 04:05:21.240]   it's one thing to say we wanna build a homeland
[04:05:21.240 --> 04:05:23.600]   for Germans in Germany.
[04:05:23.600 --> 04:05:25.240]   It's one thing to say we wanna build a homelands
[04:05:25.240 --> 04:05:28.040]   for Germans somewhere else.
[04:05:28.040 --> 04:05:32.400]   And that was Palestine, that was Zionism.
[04:05:32.400 --> 04:05:34.640]   And that was only possible thanks to fiat,
[04:05:34.640 --> 04:05:36.600]   thanks to the ability of the British government
[04:05:36.600 --> 04:05:38.480]   and all these other governments
[04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:42.120]   to continue to finance this colonialist effort over time.
[04:05:42.120 --> 04:05:45.880]   And, you know, it continues to finance war
[04:05:45.880 --> 04:05:48.680]   and it continues, you know, we see war all over the world
[04:05:48.680 --> 04:05:52.600]   continue to escalate because the people
[04:05:52.600 --> 04:05:54.360]   who'd make the decision to escalate the war
[04:05:54.360 --> 04:05:55.760]   are not the ones who are paying for it
[04:05:55.760 --> 04:05:57.160]   and they're not the ones who are fighting.
[04:05:57.160 --> 04:05:58.960]   They're the ones who sit in offices.
[04:05:58.960 --> 04:06:00.320]   And in the case of, you know,
[04:06:00.320 --> 04:06:02.000]   most of Middle Eastern conflict,
[04:06:02.000 --> 04:06:04.960]   it's people who live abroad, you know,
[04:06:04.960 --> 04:06:07.040]   it's people who are abroad or not part of it
[04:06:07.040 --> 04:06:09.200]   who just are emotionally charged to it
[04:06:09.200 --> 04:06:11.200]   because they watch it on TV.
[04:06:11.200 --> 04:06:14.320]   So, you know, you have billions of Muslims around the world
[04:06:14.320 --> 04:06:16.560]   and Jews around the world
[04:06:16.560 --> 04:06:19.400]   who feel extremely emotionally attached to it.
[04:06:19.400 --> 04:06:20.360]   They're not the ones fighting,
[04:06:20.360 --> 04:06:22.520]   they're not the ones paying their own money.
[04:06:22.520 --> 04:06:24.880]   They're just getting governments to send money
[04:06:24.880 --> 04:06:27.520]   and to send weapons and to take part.
[04:06:27.520 --> 04:06:32.520]   And it's fun as a spectator sport
[04:06:32.520 --> 04:06:33.960]   for most of these people
[04:06:33.960 --> 04:06:35.440]   because they don't get to live in it.
[04:06:35.440 --> 04:06:37.040]   But I got to live in it, I saw it.
[04:06:37.040 --> 04:06:37.880]   I grew up there.
[04:06:37.880 --> 04:06:40.760]   I saw the settlement expansion.
[04:06:40.760 --> 04:06:42.320]   And, you know, recently, a few weeks ago,
[04:06:42.320 --> 04:06:45.240]   I went back to Ramallah and it's just,
[04:06:45.240 --> 04:06:47.320]   it's amazing every time you go,
[04:06:47.320 --> 04:06:50.840]   the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way.
[04:06:50.840 --> 04:06:55.160]   Like it's not just housing units that are going up,
[04:06:55.160 --> 04:06:57.480]   it's an entire attempt to build,
[04:06:57.480 --> 04:07:01.520]   to basically suffocate Palestinian areas
[04:07:01.520 --> 04:07:02.960]   and force Palestinians to leave
[04:07:02.960 --> 04:07:06.240]   or keep them living in horrific conditions.
[04:07:06.240 --> 04:07:11.720]   - And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,
[04:07:11.720 --> 04:07:13.840]   I have family in Russia,
[04:07:13.840 --> 04:07:17.720]   since this war, echoes of similar things are happening
[04:07:17.720 --> 04:07:19.560]   in that part of the world too.
[04:07:19.560 --> 04:07:23.560]   And I shudder to think about the decades to come
[04:07:23.560 --> 04:07:25.360]   of the hate that is brewing,
[04:07:25.360 --> 04:07:27.160]   the suffering that is brewing
[04:07:27.160 --> 04:07:29.880]   based on decisions and pressures
[04:07:30.080 --> 04:07:35.080]   and from not always people directly impacted by this.
[04:07:35.080 --> 04:07:40.920]   So again, it feels like that military conflict
[04:07:40.920 --> 04:07:45.360]   is not just a creation of like people on the ground.
[04:07:45.360 --> 04:07:48.160]   It's a creation of leaders, power centers.
[04:07:48.160 --> 04:07:52.440]   And perhaps, again, I'm not smart enough,
[04:07:52.440 --> 04:07:55.600]   but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.
[04:07:55.600 --> 04:07:56.880]   - I absolutely think it does.
[04:07:56.880 --> 04:07:58.920]   Monetary system is what allows,
[04:07:59.840 --> 04:08:01.560]   is what allows people to just continue
[04:08:01.560 --> 04:08:04.200]   to treat war as a spectator sport.
[04:08:04.200 --> 04:08:06.000]   That's really what it comes down to.
[04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:09.120]   And it starts with World War I and it's continued.
[04:08:09.120 --> 04:08:13.320]   And this is why I really, I think I've said this before,
[04:08:13.320 --> 04:08:15.720]   I've tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet,
[04:08:15.720 --> 04:08:20.160]   but it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea
[04:08:20.160 --> 04:08:22.080]   with mockery, of course.
[04:08:22.080 --> 04:08:24.320]   But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology
[04:08:24.320 --> 04:08:26.400]   that's going to end World War I.
[04:08:26.400 --> 04:08:28.440]   Once World War I started,
[04:08:28.440 --> 04:08:30.120]   we got into this endless conflict
[04:08:30.120 --> 04:08:32.240]   that's been ongoing since then.
[04:08:32.240 --> 04:08:33.800]   If you look at all the world's conflicts today,
[04:08:33.800 --> 04:08:36.400]   pretty much they all trace back to World War I.
[04:08:36.400 --> 04:08:39.760]   And it's because when that Pandora's box
[04:08:39.760 --> 04:08:42.560]   of government control of money was opened,
[04:08:42.560 --> 04:08:44.920]   there was no longer a real restraint on war,
[04:08:44.920 --> 04:08:47.640]   except complete defeat and complete destruction
[04:08:47.640 --> 04:08:48.480]   and complete death.
[04:08:48.480 --> 04:08:50.200]   The war had to be total.
[04:08:50.200 --> 04:08:53.220]   Before that, under the gold standard,
[04:08:53.220 --> 04:08:57.020]   kings would send professional armies
[04:08:57.020 --> 04:08:59.720]   to fight each other in battlefields.
[04:08:59.720 --> 04:09:02.040]   And as soon as it became clear
[04:09:02.040 --> 04:09:04.640]   that one side was establishing an advantage,
[04:09:04.640 --> 04:09:09.640]   the fighting would stop and the kings would settle,
[04:09:09.640 --> 04:09:12.240]   would agree to new terms,
[04:09:12.240 --> 04:09:13.400]   because it was extremely expensive
[04:09:13.400 --> 04:09:16.440]   to build a professional army and you ran out of money.
[04:09:16.440 --> 04:09:18.240]   So it was always the smartest thing to do
[04:09:18.240 --> 04:09:20.920]   is to just stop fighting whenever you could.
[04:09:20.920 --> 04:09:23.000]   And wars would take place,
[04:09:23.000 --> 04:09:25.340]   countries would fight each other in the battlefield.
[04:09:25.340 --> 04:09:28.160]   But in the cities, life went on as normal.
[04:09:28.160 --> 04:09:30.020]   And people within the same cities,
[04:09:30.020 --> 04:09:31.640]   within the cities of the two countries
[04:09:31.640 --> 04:09:33.720]   would be trading with one another.
[04:09:33.720 --> 04:09:35.460]   Life would go on, but the war would be there.
[04:09:35.460 --> 04:09:40.460]   And it was just an independent part of politics
[04:09:40.460 --> 04:09:43.880]   that, all right, we have a problem over this piece of land.
[04:09:43.880 --> 04:09:46.160]   Let's take it outside.
[04:09:46.160 --> 04:09:48.660]   We don't fight in the civilian areas.
[04:09:48.660 --> 04:09:51.480]   We go to the battlefield, we fight with professional armies.
[04:09:51.480 --> 04:09:53.920]   And in fact, sometimes the conflicts would be,
[04:09:53.920 --> 04:09:55.760]   the armies would line up
[04:09:55.760 --> 04:09:59.060]   and they would just have a small contingent
[04:09:59.060 --> 04:10:00.720]   of the two armies fight with one another.
[04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:03.140]   And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage,
[04:10:03.140 --> 04:10:07.100]   then all right, well, you won, let's move on with it.
[04:10:07.100 --> 04:10:10.320]   Governments were far, far, far more careful
[04:10:10.320 --> 04:10:14.800]   about their monetary policy and their,
[04:10:14.800 --> 04:10:15.960]   sorry, their war policy
[04:10:15.960 --> 04:10:17.600]   when they couldn't print their money.
[04:10:17.600 --> 04:10:19.640]   And that has changed with fiat.
[04:10:19.640 --> 04:10:22.880]   And that has allowed this new emergence of this class
[04:10:22.880 --> 04:10:24.960]   of what I like to call chicken hawks,
[04:10:24.960 --> 04:10:26.720]   of people who sit in offices,
[04:10:26.720 --> 04:10:29.440]   like the entire foreign policy establishment
[04:10:29.440 --> 04:10:31.280]   in Washington, DC,
[04:10:31.280 --> 04:10:33.080]   people who have never fought a war,
[04:10:33.080 --> 04:10:35.120]   whose children will never fight a war,
[04:10:35.120 --> 04:10:37.120]   who will never pay to fight a war,
[04:10:37.120 --> 04:10:40.380]   who will never suffer a broken window in their house
[04:10:40.380 --> 04:10:41.760]   because of war,
[04:10:41.760 --> 04:10:45.600]   sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage
[04:10:45.600 --> 04:10:48.560]   that they teach at moronic fiat universities
[04:10:48.560 --> 04:10:50.560]   about politics and geopolitics,
[04:10:50.560 --> 04:10:51.840]   making decisions about,
[04:10:51.840 --> 04:10:53.400]   we need to invade that country
[04:10:53.400 --> 04:10:54.520]   and we need to send war there.
[04:10:54.520 --> 04:10:55.920]   And they can do that
[04:10:55.920 --> 04:10:58.320]   because they have this endless money printer.
[04:10:58.320 --> 04:11:01.520]   And that's why, back under gold,
[04:11:01.520 --> 04:11:03.200]   if you were a warrior,
[04:11:03.200 --> 04:11:05.480]   you went and actually joined the war.
[04:11:05.480 --> 04:11:09.360]   And the people who pontificated about war
[04:11:09.360 --> 04:11:10.920]   were the people who had experience with war,
[04:11:10.920 --> 04:11:13.600]   the people who were sending their own children to war,
[04:11:13.600 --> 04:11:15.840]   the people who were fighting with their own money.
[04:11:15.840 --> 04:11:18.720]   Now you have all these fat parasitics come,
[04:11:18.720 --> 04:11:20.080]   sitting in Washington, DC,
[04:11:20.080 --> 04:11:22.320]   deciding, and Washington's just an example,
[04:11:22.320 --> 04:11:24.160]   but all over the world, this exists.
[04:11:24.160 --> 04:11:25.120]   People who have never fought,
[04:11:25.120 --> 04:11:26.800]   who will never carry the consequences,
[04:11:26.800 --> 04:11:30.000]   who are going to devalue the world's money
[04:11:30.000 --> 04:11:33.200]   in order to go and have other people's children
[04:11:33.200 --> 04:11:36.080]   fight each other because of stupid garbage
[04:11:36.080 --> 04:11:39.240]   they learned about politics in university.
[04:11:39.240 --> 04:11:44.360]   - You said you value low time preference,
[04:11:44.360 --> 04:11:45.760]   but I have news for you
[04:11:45.760 --> 04:11:48.160]   that one day you will die,
[04:11:48.160 --> 04:11:50.260]   as far as we know, you're a mortal being.
[04:11:50.260 --> 04:11:52.560]   Do you think about your death?
[04:11:52.560 --> 04:11:54.320]   Do you think about your mortality?
[04:11:54.320 --> 04:11:56.400]   Are you afraid of it?
[04:11:56.400 --> 04:12:02.560]   - I've spent a lot of time introspecting
[04:12:02.560 --> 04:12:03.680]   and thinking about these things,
[04:12:03.680 --> 04:12:06.080]   and I value life a lot.
[04:12:06.080 --> 04:12:08.320]   I value my time on Earth a lot.
[04:12:08.320 --> 04:12:11.240]   And you'll see this in my dealings with people.
[04:12:11.240 --> 04:12:13.120]   Go back to Twitter,
[04:12:13.120 --> 04:12:15.360]   why am I so brash and straightforward?
[04:12:15.360 --> 04:12:17.440]   It really is because life is short,
[04:12:17.440 --> 04:12:19.120]   because I don't wanna waste,
[04:12:19.120 --> 04:12:20.720]   I think on my,
[04:12:20.720 --> 04:12:25.080]   I've said this before,
[04:12:25.080 --> 04:12:27.600]   on my tombstone, let it be written,
[04:12:27.600 --> 04:12:30.720]   he never let anyone waste his time twice in his life.
[04:12:30.720 --> 04:12:33.360]   - His life is short.
[04:12:33.360 --> 04:12:35.000]   - Yeah, you can waste my time once,
[04:12:35.000 --> 04:12:36.280]   you can get me to do something,
[04:12:36.280 --> 04:12:37.680]   and then I realize that was a waste of time,
[04:12:37.680 --> 04:12:39.760]   you will never get me to waste my time twice.
[04:12:39.760 --> 04:12:42.880]   And so you show up in my Twitter with something stupid,
[04:12:42.880 --> 04:12:43.720]   you're never showing up in my Twitter ever again.
[04:12:43.720 --> 04:12:45.440]   - So you're a fast learner.
[04:12:45.440 --> 04:12:47.640]   You give people a chance, but you're a fast learner.
[04:12:47.640 --> 04:12:50.760]   - Yeah, so I try and use my time very wisely,
[04:12:50.760 --> 04:12:52.840]   and I'm unapologetic about it.
[04:12:52.840 --> 04:12:54.320]   My time is the most precious thing,
[04:12:54.320 --> 04:12:58.360]   and the way to get on my shit list forever
[04:12:58.360 --> 04:13:01.080]   is to try and take away my time,
[04:13:01.080 --> 04:13:02.240]   and to abuse my time.
[04:13:02.240 --> 04:13:03.160]   If you do that,
[04:13:03.160 --> 04:13:08.680]   it's the one unforgivable sin for me.
[04:13:08.680 --> 04:13:09.880]   And I think that's really,
[04:13:09.880 --> 04:13:13.000]   I think that's my way of coming to terms with mortality.
[04:13:13.000 --> 04:13:14.280]   We're all gonna die,
[04:13:14.280 --> 04:13:15.640]   and so let's make the most out of it
[04:13:15.640 --> 04:13:16.600]   while we're still here.
[04:13:16.600 --> 04:13:18.000]   And of course, the other way you come to terms
[04:13:18.000 --> 04:13:19.800]   with mortality is you have children.
[04:13:19.800 --> 04:13:23.160]   - Given what you just said,
[04:13:23.160 --> 04:13:26.920]   doubly so, it's a huge honor
[04:13:26.920 --> 04:13:29.460]   that you would spend your valuable time with me.
[04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:30.920]   This is the first time you did it,
[04:13:30.920 --> 04:13:32.840]   so you probably regret all of it,
[04:13:32.840 --> 04:13:35.200]   so we'll probably never see each other again.
[04:13:35.200 --> 04:13:38.280]   But I'm glad you at least took the chance to do it.
[04:13:38.280 --> 04:13:40.880]   It's a huge honor, and I've been a huge fan of yours.
[04:13:40.880 --> 04:13:42.800]   - Thank you, sir. - I think you have
[04:13:42.800 --> 04:13:45.080]   impact on the world that you probably
[04:13:45.080 --> 04:13:46.040]   are not even aware of.
[04:13:46.040 --> 04:13:47.640]   It's tremendous.
[04:13:47.640 --> 04:13:49.200]   And a lot of people love you,
[04:13:49.200 --> 04:13:50.280]   and your work is important.
[04:13:50.280 --> 04:13:53.600]   Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say,
[04:13:53.600 --> 04:13:55.120]   and there's people that disagree with you,
[04:13:55.120 --> 04:13:57.000]   but everybody respects you.
[04:13:57.000 --> 04:13:58.240]   And thank you so much for spending
[04:13:58.240 --> 04:14:00.160]   your really valuable time with me today, brother.
[04:14:00.160 --> 04:14:01.000]   - Thank you, sir.
[04:14:01.000 --> 04:14:01.820]   I really appreciate it.
[04:14:01.820 --> 04:14:02.760]   This was not a waste of time,
[04:14:02.760 --> 04:14:04.840]   and I'd be happy to do it again.
[04:14:04.840 --> 04:14:06.400]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:14:06.400 --> 04:14:07.800]   with "Save Deena Moose."
[04:14:07.800 --> 04:14:09.040]   To support this podcast,
[04:14:09.040 --> 04:14:11.560]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[04:14:11.560 --> 04:14:13.720]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[04:14:13.720 --> 04:14:16.560]   from the Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek.
[04:14:16.560 --> 04:14:19.960]   Economic control is not merely control
[04:14:19.960 --> 04:14:21.500]   of a sector of human life,
[04:14:21.500 --> 04:14:23.520]   which can be separated from the rest.
[04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:27.660]   It is the control of the means for all our ends.
[04:14:27.660 --> 04:14:31.680]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[04:14:31.680 --> 04:14:34.260]   (upbeat music)
[04:14:34.260 --> 04:14:36.840]   (upbeat music)
