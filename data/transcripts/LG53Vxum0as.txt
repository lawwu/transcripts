[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.740]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.860]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.140]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.460]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.840]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.660]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.780]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.420]   I want to thank the first sponsor of today's podcast.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.920]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.840]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.780]   that analyzes blood factors and DNA-related factors
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.200]   that helps you develop a personalized health plan.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300]   Many important factors related to our health and wellbeing
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.740]   can only be measured by a blood sample and by a DNA sample.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.580]   I've been getting my blood work done for many years now,
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.060]   and I use Inside Tracker
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.760]   because Inside Tracker makes it very easy
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.860]   to not only get the blood work done,
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.140]   someone can come to your house,
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.420]   or you can go to a clinic, for instance,
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.100]   but also to interpret the data that you get.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.260]   Oftentimes, when we get blood work done,
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.980]   there are all these numbers and all these levels
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.520]   of different hormones and metabolic factors and so forth,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420]   but one doesn't know what to do with that information.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.260]   Inside Tracker has a terrific dashboard platform
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.740]   where you go online and it makes analyzing all that easy,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.860]   and it also provides some very simple
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.420]   and straightforward directives in terms of exercise,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.640]   nutrition, and other lifestyle factors
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.660]   that can help guide your health and improve your health.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.480]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.740]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.820]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.700]   to get 25% off your order.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.660]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.180]   Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditating easy.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.480]   I've been meditating on and off for about three decades now,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.100]   and typically, it's been more off than on.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.220]   I think like a lot of people,
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.260]   I find it hard to stick with a meditation practice.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.020]   A few years ago, I started using the Headspace app,
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.000]   and when I did that,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   I found that I was meditating really consistently.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.640]   First of all, the meditations in Headspace
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.840]   are backed by quality scientific peer-reviewed studies.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.100]   Second of all, the meditations allow the meditation
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.080]   to be kind of easy and fun to access.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.340]   I started first using them when I would travel
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.520]   because on JetBlue flights, which was the airline I was using
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.640]   the meditations are offered as an alternative
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.680]   to watching a TV or a movie.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.880]   And I found that I would arrive feeling much more refreshed
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.380]   than had I just sort of zoned out on the TV the whole time,
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380]   or even if I had slept.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.920]   I now continue to use Headspace regularly
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.240]   pretty much every day for a short meditation,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.300]   and I personally derive tremendous benefits from it.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.120]   If you'd like to try Headspace,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.440]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.520]   and they'll give you one month of all the meditations
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.380]   that they have available completely free.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.120]   That's the best offer available right now from Headspace.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000]   So you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.100]   and you'll get one month completely free
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.240]   all the meditations they have.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.020]   The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.260]   Made For is a behavioral science company
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.060]   that is a subscription model
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.200]   in which you engage in specific activities
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.780]   each month for 10 months
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.220]   in order to bring about positive behavioral change
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.840]   and growth mindset.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.040]   The company was founded by former Navy Seal Patrick Dossett,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.600]   as well as Tom's founder, Blake Mycoskie.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.560]   I'm the lead advisor
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.660]   of the Scientific Advisory Board at Made For,
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.440]   and some of the other members of the advisory board
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   include the head of the Chronobiology Unit
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220]   at the National Institutes of Health,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.720]   as well as psychiatrists from Harvard, UC Irvine,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.660]   and many other individuals who are serious about science
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.360]   and helped develop the Made For program.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.160]   If you want to try Made For, you can go to getmadefor.com,
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.240]   and if you enter Huberman at checkout,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.360]   you'll get 15% off the program.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.800]   Today, we're talking about neuroplasticity,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.180]   which is this incredible feature of our nervous systems
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.880]   that allows it to change in response to experience.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.800]   Neuroplasticity is arguably
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.120]   one of the most important aspects of our biology.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.680]   It holds the promise for each and all of us
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   to think differently, to learn new things,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.800]   to forget painful experiences,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.480]   and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.700]   by becoming better.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.560]   Neuroplasticity has a long and important history,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.100]   and we're not going to review all of it in detail,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.040]   but today, what we are going to do
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   is discuss what is neuroplasticity,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.480]   as well as the different forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.080]   We're going to talk about how to access neuroplasticity
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.580]   depending on how old you are
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.500]   and depending on the specific types of changes
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.560]   that you're trying to create.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.860]   This is a topic for which there are lots of tools,
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.280]   as well as lots of biological principles
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.800]   that we can discuss.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.640]   So let's get started.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.840]   Most people are familiar with the word neuroplasticity.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.980]   It's sometimes also called neuroplasticity.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.560]   Those are the same thing.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   So if I say neuroplasticity or neuroplasticity,
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.400]   I'm referring to the same process,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.920]   which is the brain and nervous system's ability
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   to change itself.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.080]   There are a lot of reasons why the nervous system
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   would do this.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.860]   It could do it in response to some traumatic event.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.680]   It could, for instance, create a sense of fear
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.040]   around a particular place
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.600]   or a fear of automobiles or planes.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.640]   It could also occur when something positive happens,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.800]   like the birth of our first child,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.640]   or when our puppy does something amusing,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.540]   or we see an incredible feat of performance in athleticism.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.480]   The word neuroplasticity means so many things
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.720]   to so many different people
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   that I thought it would be important
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.840]   to just first put a little bit of organizational logic
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.300]   around what it is and how it happens.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.420]   Because nowadays, if you were to go online
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.800]   and Google the word neuroplasticity,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.400]   you would find hundreds of thousands of references,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.240]   scientific references, as well as a lot of falsehoods
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.440]   about what neuroplasticity is and how to access it.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.280]   As I mentioned before,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.840]   we're going to talk about the science of it,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.040]   and we're going to talk about the tools
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.680]   that allow you to engage this incredible feature
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.920]   of your nervous system.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.040]   And that's the first point,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.220]   which is that all of us were born with a nervous system
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.440]   that isn't just capable of change,
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   but was designed to change.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.980]   When we enter the world,
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.600]   our nervous system is primed for learning.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.720]   The brain and nervous system of a baby
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.120]   is wired very crudely.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.400]   The connections are not precise,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.800]   and we can see evidence of that in the fact that babies
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.980]   are kind of flopping there
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.180]   like a kind of a little potato bug with limbs.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.180]   They can't really do much in terms of coordinated movement.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.240]   They certainly can't speak,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.480]   and they can't really do anything with precision.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.960]   And that's because we come into this world over-connected.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.400]   We have essentially wires.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.720]   Those wires have names like axons and dendrites.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.320]   Those are the different parts of the neurons
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   discussed in episode one.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.520]   But those little parts and those wires and connections
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   are everywhere.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   Imagine a bunch of roads
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.120]   that are all connected to one another in kind of a mess,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.880]   but there are no highways.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   They're all just small roads.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.760]   That's essentially what the young nervous system is like.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.660]   And then as we mature,
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   as we go from day one of life to 10 years old,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.880]   20 years old, 30 years old,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.300]   what happens is particular connections get reinforced
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.480]   and stronger and other connections are lost.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.000]   So that's the first important principle that I want everyone
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.960]   to understand, which is that developmental plasticity,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   the neuroplasticity that occurs from the time we're born
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.000]   until about age 25 is mainly a process
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.320]   of removing connections that don't serve our goals well.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.140]   Now, of course, certain events happen
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.360]   during that birth to 25 period
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.400]   in which positive events and negative events
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.820]   are really stamped down into our nervous system
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.480]   in a very dramatic fashion
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.400]   by what we call one trial learning.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.840]   We experienced something once
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.240]   and then our nervous system is forever changed
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.460]   by that experience.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.520]   Unless of course we go through some work
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.280]   to undo that experience.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.500]   So I want you to imagine in your mind
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.520]   that when you were brought into this world,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.500]   you were essentially a widely connected web of connections
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.460]   that was really poor at doing any one thing.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.020]   And that through your experience,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.220]   what you were exposed to by your parents or other caretakers
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.200]   through your social interactions, through your thoughts,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.940]   through the languages that you learn,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.160]   through the places you traveled or didn't travel,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.460]   your nervous system became customized
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.900]   to your unique experience.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.500]   Now, that's true for certain parts of your brain
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.880]   that are involved in what we call representations
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   of the outside world.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.560]   or represent the auditory world
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.280]   or represent the gallery of smells
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.000]   that are possible in the world.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.440]   However, there are aspects of your nervous system
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.560]   that were designed not to be plastic.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.520]   They were wired so that plasticity
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   or changes in those circuits is very unlikely.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.200]   Those circuits include things like
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.140]   the ones that control your heartbeat,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.000]   the ones that control your breathing,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.760]   the ones that control your digestion.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.640]   And thank goodness that those circuits were set up that way
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.460]   because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.940]   You never want to have to think about
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.300]   whether or not your heart will beat
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.920]   or whether or not you will continue breathing
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.680]   or whether or not you'll be able to digest your food.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.760]   So many nervous system features like digestion
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.620]   and breathing and heart rate are hard to change.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.040]   Other aspects of our nervous system
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.720]   are actually quite easy to change.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.700]   And one of the great gifts of childhood,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.560]   adolescence and young adulthood,
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.980]   is that we can learn through almost passive experience.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.720]   We don't have to focus that hard
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.360]   in order to learn new things.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.840]   In fact, children go from being able
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.240]   to speak no language whatsoever,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.380]   to being able to speak many, many words
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.640]   and comprise sentences,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.720]   including words they've never heard before,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   which is remarkable.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.580]   It means that the portions of the brain
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.180]   involved in speech and language
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.580]   are actually primed to learn and create new combinations.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.840]   What this tells us is that the young brain
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.160]   is a plasticity machine.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.080]   But then right about age 25,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   plus or minus a year or two, everything changes.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.320]   After age 25 or so,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.780]   in order to get changes in our nervous system,
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.520]   we have to engage in a completely different set of processes
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.400]   in order to get those changes to occur
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.680]   and for them, more importantly, to stick around.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.120]   And this is something that I think is vastly overlooked
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.560]   in the popular culture discussion about neuroplasticity.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.680]   People always talk about fire together, wire together.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.320]   Fire together, wire together is true.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.280]   It is the statement of my colleague at Stanford,
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.780]   Carla Schatz, and it's an absolute truth
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.200]   about the way that the nervous system
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   wires up early in development.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.320]   But fire together, wire together
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.360]   doesn't apply in the same way after age 25.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.040]   And so we have these little memes and these little quotes
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.140]   that circulate on the internet,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.780]   like fire together, wire together,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.440]   or there's a famous quote from the greatest neurobiologist
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.020]   of all time, Ramon y Cajal.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.380]   I think it goes something like,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.680]   should somebody wish to change their nervous system,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.100]   they could be the sculptor of their nervous system
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.280]   in any way they want, something like that.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.260]   And that sounds great.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.220]   I mean, who wouldn't want to change their nervous system
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.320]   any way they want?
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.780]   But what's lost in those statements
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.920]   is how to actually accomplish that.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.660]   And we're going to cover that today.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.280]   But please understand that early in development,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.340]   your nervous system is connected very broadly
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.080]   in ways that make it very hard to do anything well.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   From birth until about age 25,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.880]   those connections get refined,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.940]   mainly through the removal of connections
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.240]   that don't serve us.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.020]   And the incredible strengthening of connections
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.020]   that relate to either powerful experiences
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.200]   or that allow us to do things like walk and talk
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.480]   and do math, et cetera.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   And then after age 25,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.480]   if we want to change those connections,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.600]   those super highways of connectivity,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.680]   we have to engage in some very specific processes.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.160]   And those processes as we'll soon learn are gated,
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.280]   meaning you can't just decide to change your brain.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.300]   You actually have to go through a series of steps
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.400]   to change your internal state
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.280]   in ways that will allow you to change your brain.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.040]   I just want to acknowledge that Costello is snoring
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.480]   particularly loud today.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.720]   Some of you seem very keen at picking up on his snoring.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.960]   Others of you can't hear his snoring.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.980]   It's very low rumbling sound.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.640]   And whether or not you can or you can't
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.740]   probably relates to the sensitivity of your hearing.
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.960]   We're actually going to talk about perfect pitch today
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.240]   and range of auditory detection.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.740]   And so if you can hear Costello's snoring,
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.180]   enjoy, if you can't, enjoy.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.840]   I want to talk about how the nervous system changes.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.120]   What are these changes?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.920]   Many of us have been captivated
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.840]   by the stories in the popular press
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.620]   about the addition of new neurons.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.000]   This idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.420]   your brain actually makes new neurons.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.280]   Well, I'm going to give you the bad news first,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.440]   which is that after puberty,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.040]   so after about age 14 or 15,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.960]   the human brain and nervous system
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.000]   adds very few, if any, new neurons.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.220]   The idea that new neurons could be added to the brain
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.480]   is one that has a rich history in experimental science.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.360]   It's clear that in rodents and in some non-human primates,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.800]   new neurons, a process called neurogenesis,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.080]   can occur in areas of the brain,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.960]   such as the olfactory bulb,
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   which is of course involved in smell,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.840]   as well as a region of our hippocampus,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.200]   the center of the brain involved in memory,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.040]   called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.620]   And there is strong evidence that new neurons
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.960]   can be added to those structures throughout the lifespan.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.380]   In humans, the evidence is a little bit more controversial.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.440]   It's clear that we can add new neurons
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.320]   to our olfactory bulb.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   In fact, if any of you have ever had
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.420]   the unfortunate experience of being hit on the head too hard,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.120]   the wires called axons from those olfactory neurons
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.540]   that live in your nose can get sheared off
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.180]   because they have to pass through a bony plate
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.200]   called the cribriform plate.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.580]   And the cribriform plate can shear those axons
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.080]   and people can become what's called anosmic.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.920]   They won't be able to smell.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.460]   But over time, those neurons,
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.980]   unlike most all central nervous system neurons,
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.400]   can grow those connections back
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.820]   and even reestablish new neurons
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.280]   added to the olfactory bulb.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.960]   They come from elsewhere deep in the brain
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.280]   and they migrate through a pathway
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.880]   called the rostral migratory stream.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.040]   You can Google these words
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   and look up some of the descriptions of this
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.480]   if you'd like to learn more.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.640]   So indeed, there's some evidence
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.760]   that the neurons responsible for smell
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.660]   can be replaced throughout the lifespan,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.840]   certainly in very young individuals
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.220]   from birth till about age 15 or so.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.920]   Whether or not there are new neurons
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.140]   added to the hippocampus,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.700]   the memory center of the human brain, isn't clear.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.960]   Many years ago, Rusty Gage's lab at the Salk Institute
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.500]   did a really important study
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.360]   looking at terminally ill cancer patients
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.900]   and injecting them with a label, a dye,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.980]   that is incorporated only into new neurons.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.920]   And after these patients died,
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.600]   their brains were harvested, the brains were looked at,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.220]   and there were new neurons there.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.480]   There was evidence for new neurons.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.520]   Those results, I think, stand over time.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.480]   But what was not really discussed
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.220]   in the popular press discussion around those papers
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.720]   was that it was very few cells that were being added.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.760]   And a number of papers have come along over the years,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   mainly from labs at UCSF,
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.440]   although from others as well,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.540]   showing that if there are new neurons
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.380]   added to the adult brain,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.720]   it's an infinitesimally small number of new neurons.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   So that's the depressing part.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.840]   We don't get new neurons.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.120]   After we're born, we pretty much have the neurons
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.400]   that we're going to use our entire life.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.860]   And yes, as we get older
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.440]   and we start to lose certain functions in our brain,
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.980]   we lose neurons.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.360]   But all is not lost, so to speak,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.860]   because there are other ways in which neural circuits
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.880]   can create new connections and add new functions,
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.180]   including new memory, new abilities,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.320]   and new cognitive functions.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.600]   And those are mainly through the process
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.720]   of making certain connections,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.500]   which of course are those things we call synapses,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.280]   between neurons, making those connections stronger
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.600]   so they're more reliable, they're more likely to engage,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.880]   as well as removing connections.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.000]   And the removal of connections is vital
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.600]   to say moving through a grieving process
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.180]   or removing the emotional load of a traumatic experience.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.340]   So even though we can't add new neurons
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.040]   throughout our lifespan,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.160]   at least not in very great numbers,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.580]   it's clear that we can change our nervous system,
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.560]   that the nervous system is available for change,
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.280]   that if we create the right set of circumstances
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.800]   in our brain, chemical circumstances,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.860]   and if we create the right environmental circumstances
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.960]   around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.080]   in which change isn't just possible, but it's probable.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.720]   As I mentioned before,
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.080]   the hallmark of the child nervous system is change.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.880]   It wants to change.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.160]   The whole thing, everything from the chemicals
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.620]   that are sloshing around in there,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.480]   to the fact that there's a lot of space between the neurons,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   a lot of people don't know this,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.160]   but early in development,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.480]   there's a lot of space between the neurons,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.240]   and so the neurons can literally move around
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.300]   and sample different connections very easily,
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.160]   removing some and keeping others.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.520]   As we get older, the so-called extracellular space
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.680]   is actually filled up by things called extracellular matrix
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.740]   and glial cells, glia means glue,
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.000]   those cells are involved in a bunch of different processes,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.160]   but they start to fill in all the space,
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   kind of like pouring concrete between rocks,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.540]   and when that happens, it becomes much harder
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.080]   to change the connections that are there.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.560]   One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.840]   at any stage throughout the lifespan
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.780]   is through deficits and impairments
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.960]   in what we call our sensory apparatus,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.520]   our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.120]   and there are some very dramatic
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.300]   and somewhat tragic examples of people, for instance,
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.380]   who have genetic mutations where they are born
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.760]   without a nose and without any olfactory structures
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.300]   in the brain, so they cannot smell.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.900]   In that case, areas of the brain
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.960]   that normally would represent smell
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.260]   become overtaken by areas of the brain
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.200]   involved in other things like touch and hearing and sight.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.600]   In individuals that are blind from birth,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.360]   the so-called occipital cortex,
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.140]   the visual cortex in the back,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.960]   becomes overtaken by hearing.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.640]   The neurons there will start to respond to sounds
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.000]   as well as braille touch,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.880]   and actually there's one particularly tragic incident
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.120]   where a woman who was blind since birth
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.660]   and because of neuroimaging studies,
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.480]   we knew her visual cortex was no longer visual,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.840]   it was responsible for braille reading and for hearing,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   she had a stroke that actually took out
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.160]   most of the function of her visual cortex,
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.180]   so then she was blind, she couldn't braille read or hear,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.620]   she did recover some aspect of function.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.860]   Now, most people, they don't end up
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.960]   in that highly unfortunate situation,
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.240]   and what we know is that, for instance,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.760]   blind people who use their visual cortex
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.840]   for braille reading and for hearing
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.320]   have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.360]   meaning they can sense things with their fingers
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.140]   and they can sense things with their hearing
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.400]   that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able to.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.180]   In fact, you will find a much greater incidence
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.300]   of perfect pitch in people that are blind,
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.400]   and that tells us that the brain,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.560]   and in particular this area we call the neocortex,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.920]   which is the outer part, is really designed
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.020]   to be a map of our own individual experience.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.080]   So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.920]   where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   or maybe has a limb development impairment
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.480]   where they have a stump instead of an entire limb
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.360]   with a functioning hand,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.060]   their brain will represent the body plan that they have,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.060]   not some other body plan.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.020]   But the beauty of the situation is that the real estate
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.000]   up in the skull, that neocortex,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.280]   the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.340]   Now, it is true, however,
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.200]   that if, let's say I were to be blind when I'm 50,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.400]   I'm 45 right now, I've always been sighted.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   If I was blind at 50, I'll probably have less opportunity
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.580]   to use my formerly visual cortex
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.700]   for things like braille reading and hearing,
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.120]   because my brain has changed,
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.800]   it's just not the same brain I had when I was a baby.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.020]   So there's actually a principle of biology,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.140]   not many people know this,
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.140]   it's actually a principle of neurology,
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.140]   which is called the Kennard principle,
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.960]   which says, if you're going to have a brain injury,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.000]   you wanna have it early in life.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.240]   And of course, better to not have a brain injury at all,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.320]   but if you're going to have it,
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.880]   you wanna have it early in life.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.600]   And this is based on a tremendous number of experiments
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.520]   examining the amount of recovery and the rate of recovery
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.500]   in humans that had lesions to their brain,
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.320]   either early in life or later in life.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.520]   So the Kennard principle says,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.800]   better to have injuries early in life.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.080]   Now, that's reassuring for the young folks,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.400]   it's not so reassuring for the older folks.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.080]   But there are aspects of neuroplasticity
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.860]   that have nothing to do with impairments.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.240]   I mean, earlier I said,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.600]   we're all walking around with this map,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.760]   this representation of the world around us,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.600]   so we can see edges, we can see colors,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.680]   except for folks that are colorblind, of course.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.600]   And we also have a map of emotional experience,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.880]   we have a map of whether or not
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.560]   certain people are trustworthy,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.620]   certain people aren't trustworthy.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.840]   A few years ago, I was at a course,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.320]   and a woman came up to me and she said,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.120]   "You know, I wasn't teaching the course, I was in the course."
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.440]   And she said, "I just have to tell you
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.760]   that every time you speak, it really stresses me out."
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.000]   And I said, "Well, I've heard that before,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.120]   but do you want to be more specific?"
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.320]   And she said, "Yeah, your tone of voice reminds me
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.760]   of somebody that I had a really terrible experience with."
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.460]   I said, "Well, okay, well, I can't change my voice,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.800]   but I really appreciate that you acknowledge that
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.300]   and it also will help explain why you seem to cringe
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.600]   every time I speak," which I hadn't noticed until then,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.520]   but after that, I did notice she had a very immediate
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.200]   and kind of visceral response to my speech,
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.360]   perhaps some of you are having that right now.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.480]   But in any event, over the period of this two-week course,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.480]   she would come back every once in a while and say,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.660]   "You know what, I think just by telling you
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.720]   that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.640]   it's actually becoming more tolerable to me."
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.560]   And by the end, we actually became pretty good friends
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.720]   and we're still in touch.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.120]   And so what this says is that the recognition of something,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.720]   whether or not that's an emotional thing
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   or a desire to learn something else
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.600]   is actually the first step in neuroplasticity.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.680]   And that's because our nervous system
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.000]   has two broad sets of functions.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.400]   Some of those functions are reflexive,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.840]   things like our breathing, our heart rate are obvious ones,
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.400]   but other aspects are reflexive like our ability to walk.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.560]   If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the door,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.360]   I don't think about each step that I'm taking
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.960]   and that's because I learned how to walk during development.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.120]   But when we decide that we're going to shift
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.220]   some sort of behavior or some reaction
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.620]   or some new piece of information that we want to learn
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.140]   is something that we want to bring into our consciousness,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.120]   that awareness is a remarkable thing
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.480]   because it cues the brain and the rest of the nervous system
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.080]   that when we engage in those reflexive actions going forward
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.600]   that those reflexive actions
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.000]   are no longer fated to be reflexive.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.340]   Now, if this sounds a little bit abstract,
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.600]   we're going to talk about protocols for how to do this.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.000]   But the first step in neuroplasticity
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.560]   is recognizing that you want to change something.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.040]   And you should immediately say,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.160]   well, kids don't go into school and say,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.620]   oh, I want to learn language
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.320]   or I want to learn social interactions.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.840]   And that's the beauty of childhood.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.280]   The whole brain has this switch flipped
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.040]   that is making change possible.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.620]   But after that, we have to be deliberate.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.720]   We have to know what it is exactly that we want to change.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.260]   Or if we don't know exactly what it is
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.440]   that we want to change,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.760]   we at least have to know that we want to change something
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.520]   about some specific experience.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.080]   In this case, I believe that she came and told me
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.640]   that my voice was really awful for her to listen to,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.720]   not to make me feel bad or for any other reason,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.040]   except that she wanted it to not be the case.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.960]   And she knew I wasn't going to stop talking.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.720]   So she decided to call it
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.940]   to her consciousness and mine as well.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.400]   So that's important.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.640]   If you want to learn something
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.360]   or you want to change your nervous system in any way,
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.460]   whether or not it's because of some impairment
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.480]   or because of something that you want to acquire,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   a cognitive skill, a motor skill, an emotional skill,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   the first thing is recognizing what that thing is.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.460]   And that often can be the hardest thing to identify.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.420]   But the brain has these self-recognition mechanisms.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.640]   And those self-recognition mechanisms
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.320]   are not vague, spiritual, or mystical,
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.540]   or even psychological concepts.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.800]   They are neurochemicals.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.320]   We're going to talk next about the neurochemicals
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.380]   that stamp down particular behaviors
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.400]   and thoughts and emotional patterns
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.500]   and tell the rest of the nervous system,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.740]   this is something to pay attention to
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.740]   because this is in the direction of the change
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.860]   that I want to make.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.700]   So I'll repeat that.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.580]   There are specific chemicals
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.500]   that when we are consciously aware
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.980]   of a change we want to make,
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.900]   or even just that we want to make some change,
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.080]   chemicals are released in the brain
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.500]   that allow us the opportunity to make those changes.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.740]   Now there are specific protocols that science tells us
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.800]   we have to follow if we want those changes to occur.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   But that self-recognition is not a kind of murky concept.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.420]   What it is is it's our forebrain,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.320]   in particular our prefrontal cortex,
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.500]   signaling the rest of our nervous system
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.780]   that something that we're about to do here,
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.340]   feel or experience is worth paying attention to.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.540]   So we'll pause there and then I'm going to move forward.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.060]   One of the biggest lies in the universe
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.240]   that seems quite prominent right now
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.140]   is that every experience you have changes your brain.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.300]   People love to say this.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.500]   They love to say your brain is going to be different
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.220]   after this lecture or that your brain is going to be
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.860]   different after today's class than it was two days ago.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.220]   And that's absolutely not true.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.440]   The nervous system doesn't just change
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.620]   because you experienced something
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.140]   unless you're a very young child.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.860]   The nervous system changes
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   when certain neurochemicals are released
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.620]   and allow whatever neurons are active
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.020]   in the period in which those chemicals are swimming around
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.180]   to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.940]   Now, this is best illustrated
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.720]   through a little bit of scientific history.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.240]   The whole basis of neuroplasticity
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.720]   is essentially ascribed to two individuals,
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.920]   although there were a lot more people
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.000]   that were involved in this work.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.880]   Those two individuals go by the name
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.940]   David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.800]   David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel started off at Johns Hopkins,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.820]   moved to Harvard Medical School.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.160]   And in the '70s and '80s, they did a series of experiments
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.800]   recording electrical activity in the brain.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.860]   They were in the visual cortex,
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.900]   meaning they put the electrodes in the visual cortex,
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.900]   and they were exploring how vision works
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.540]   and how the visual brain organizes all the features
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.700]   of the visual world to give us these incredible things
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.500]   we call visual perceptions.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.580]   But Hubel was a physician,
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.020]   and he was very interested in what happens
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.100]   when, for instance, a child comes into the world
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.660]   and they have a cataract.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.980]   The lens of their eye isn't clear, but it's opaque.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.420]   Or when a kid has a lazy eye
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.260]   or the eyes have what's called strabismus,
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.240]   which is when the eyes either deviate outward or inward.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.220]   These are very common things of childhood,
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.460]   especially in particular areas of the world.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.740]   And what David and Torsten did
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.040]   is they figured out that there was a critical period
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.080]   in which if clear vision did not occur,
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.520]   the visual brain would completely rewire itself
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.660]   basically to represent whatever bit of visual information
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.840]   was coming in.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.580]   So they did these experiments
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.380]   to kind of simulate a droopy eye or a deviating eye
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.700]   where they would close one eyelid.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.700]   And then what they found is that the visual brain
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.740]   would respond entirely to the open eye.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.100]   There was sort of a takeover of the visual brain
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.180]   representing the open eye.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.260]   Many experiments in many different sensory systems
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.560]   followed up on this.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.600]   There are beautiful experiments, for instance,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.540]   from Greg Reckenzone's lab up at UC Davis
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.020]   and Mike Merzenich's labs at UCSF
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.420]   showing that, for instance,
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.860]   if two fingers were taped together early in development,
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.560]   so they weren't moving independently,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.180]   the representation of those two fingers
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.700]   would become fused in the brain
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.660]   so that the person couldn't actually distinguish
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.020]   the movements and the sensations
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.300]   of the two fingers separately.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.200]   Pretty remarkable.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.540]   All of this is to say that David and Torsten's work,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.440]   for which they won a Nobel Prize,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.100]   they shared it with Roger Sperry,
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.540]   their work showed that the brain is in fact
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.440]   a customized map of the outside world.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.780]   We said that already.
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.220]   But that what it's doing is it's measuring
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.800]   the amount of activity for a given part of our body,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.060]   one eye or the other, or our fingers,
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.220]   this finger or that finger,
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.780]   and all of those inputs are competing
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.860]   for space in the brain.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.780]   Now, this is fundamentally important
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.660]   because what it means is that
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.040]   if we are to change our nervous system in adulthood,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.780]   we need to think about not just what we're trying to get,
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.060]   but what we're trying to give up.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.280]   We can't actually add new connections
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.580]   without removing something else.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.100]   And that might seem like kind of a stinger,
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.540]   but it actually turns out to be a great advantage.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.980]   One of the key experiments that David and Torsten did
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.720]   was an experiment where they closed both eyes,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.820]   where they essentially removed all visual input
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.060]   early in development.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.640]   Now, this is slightly different than blindness
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.780]   because it was transient,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.580]   it was only for a short period of time.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.480]   But what they found is when they did that,
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.740]   there was no change.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.220]   However, if they closed just one eye,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.020]   there was a huge change.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.340]   So when people tell you,
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.260]   "Oh, at the end of today's lecture,
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.580]   at the end of something,
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.700]   your brain is going to be completely different,"
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.780]   that's simply not true.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.100]   If you're older than 25,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.980]   your brain will not change
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.580]   unless there's a selective shift in your attention
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.340]   or a selective shift in your experience
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.100]   that tells the brain it's time to change.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.820]   And those changes occur
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.140]   through the ways I talked about before,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.420]   strengthening and weakening of particular connections.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.180]   They have names like long-term potentiation,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.040]   long-term depression,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.740]   which has nothing to do with emotional depression,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.940]   by the way, spike timing dependent plasticity.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.380]   I threw out those names not to confuse you,
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.040]   but for those of you that would like
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.320]   more in-depth exploration of those,
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.660]   please, you can go Google those and look them up.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.160]   There are great Wikipedia pages for them,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.520]   and you can go down the paper trail.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.200]   I might even touch on them in some subsequent episodes.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.280]   But the important thing to understand
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.580]   is that if we want something to change,
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.900]   we really need to bring an immense amount of attention
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.100]   to whatever it is that we want to change.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.560]   This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.580]   about it all starts with an awareness.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.120]   Now, why is that attention important?
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.340]   Well, David and Torrenston won their Nobel Prize,
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.180]   and they certainly deserved it.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.080]   They probably deserved two
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.700]   because they also figured out how vision works.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.860]   And I might be biased
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.380]   'cause they're my scientific great-grandparents,
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.380]   but I think everybody in the field of neuroscience agrees
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.260]   that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called,
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.640]   H and W for those in the game,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.140]   absolutely deserved a Nobel Prize for their work
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.680]   because they really unveiled the mechanisms
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.060]   of brain change, of plasticity.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.460]   David passed away a few years ago.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.380]   Torrenston's still alive.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.580]   He's in his late 90s.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.160]   He's still at the Rockefeller University.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.320]   He's sharp as a tack.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.440]   He still jogs several miles a day.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.840]   He's really into art and a number of other things.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.060]   He's also a super nice guy.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.520]   Hubel was a really nice guy as well.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.740]   It's also, he was a great Frisbee player, I discovered,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.100]   'cause he beat me in a game of "Ultimate"
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.740]   when he was like 80,
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.080]   which still has me a little bit irked.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.160]   But anyway, Hubel and Wiesel did an amazing thing
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.620]   for science that will forever change the way
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.300]   that we think about the brain.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.680]   However, they were quite wrong
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.720]   about this critical period thing.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.960]   The critical period was this idea
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.400]   that if you were to deprive the nervous system of an input,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.320]   say closing one eye early in development
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.720]   and the rest of the visual cortex is taken over
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.760]   by the representation of the open eye,
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.920]   that you could never change that
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.960]   unless you intervened early.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.280]   And this actually formed the basis
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.160]   for why a kid that has a lazy eye or a cataract,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.860]   why even though there's some issues
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.080]   with anesthesia in young children,
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.000]   why now we know that you want to get in there early
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.400]   and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.640]   That's what ophthalmologists do.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.980]   However, their idea that you had to do it early
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.720]   or else there was no opportunity
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.600]   to rescue the nervous system deficit later on,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.120]   turned out wasn't entirely true.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.700]   In the early '90s, a graduate student
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.080]   by the name of Greg Reckenzone was in the laboratory
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.920]   of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.560]   And they set out to test this idea
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.140]   that if one wants to change their brain,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.680]   they need to do it early in life
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.100]   because the adult brain simply isn't plastic.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.720]   It's not available for these changes.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.280]   And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.780]   By now, I think we can say proving
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.280]   that the adult brain can change
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.840]   provided certain conditions are met.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   Now, the experiments they did are tough.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.480]   They were tough on the experimenter
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.920]   and they were tough on the subject.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.200]   I'll just describe one.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.940]   Let's say you were a subject in one of their experiments.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.060]   You would come into the lab and you'd sit down at a table
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.440]   and they would record from or image your brain
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.600]   and look at the representation of your fingers,
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.720]   the digits as we call them.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.400]   And there would be a spinning drum,
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   literally like a stone drum in front of you
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.480]   or a metal drum that had little bumps.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   Some of the bumps were spaced close together.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.440]   Some of them were spaced far apart.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.100]   And they would do these experiments
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.280]   where they would expect their subjects
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.560]   to press a lever whenever, for instance,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.080]   the bumps got closer together or further apart.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.880]   And these were very subtle differences.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.720]   So in order to do this,
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.740]   you really have to pay attention
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.680]   to the distance between the bumps.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.700]   And these were not braille readers or anyone skilled
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.160]   in doing these kinds of experiments.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.880]   What they found was that as people
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   paid more and more attention
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.840]   to the distance between these bumps
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   and they would signal when there was a change
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.240]   by pressing a lever.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.920]   As they did that, there was very rapid changes,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.200]   plasticity in the representation of the fingers.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.780]   And it could go in either direction.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.360]   You could get people very good
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.840]   at detecting the distance between bumps
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.340]   that the distance was getting smaller
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.720]   or the distance was getting greater.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.560]   So people could get very good at these tasks
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.120]   that they're kind of hard to imagine
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.600]   how they would translate to the real world
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.840]   for a non braille reader.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.220]   But what it told us is that these maps of touch
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.660]   were very much available for plasticity.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.100]   And these were fully adult subjects.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.120]   They're not taking any specific drugs.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.680]   They don't have any impairments that we're aware of.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.720]   And what it showed, what it proved
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.840]   is that the adult brain is very plastic.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.980]   And they did some beautiful control experiments
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.040]   that are important for everyone to understand,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.680]   which is that sometimes they would bring people in
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.480]   and they would have them touch these bumps
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.120]   on this spinning drum.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.760]   But they would have the person pay attention
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.000]   to an auditory cue.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.440]   Every time a tone would go off
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.960]   or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.240]   they would have to signal that.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.620]   So the subject thought they were doing something
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.800]   related to touch and hearing.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.680]   And all that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.400]   of touching these bumps.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.680]   They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.820]   If they were placing their attention
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.880]   on the auditory cue, on the tone,
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.420]   well then there was plasticity
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.320]   in the auditory portion of the brain,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.200]   but not on the touch portion of the brain.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.860]   And this really spits in the face of this thing
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.640]   that you hear so often, which is every experience
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.940]   that you have is going to change the way your brain works.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.220]   Absolutely not.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.660]   The experiences that you pay super careful attention to
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.700]   are what open up plasticity.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.060]   And it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.640]   So the question then is why?
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.200]   And Merzenich and his graduate students and postdocs
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.560]   went on to address this question of why.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.440]   And it turns out the answer
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.520]   is a very straightforward neurochemical answer.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.120]   And inside of that answer is the opportunity
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.980]   for any of us to change our brain at any point
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.180]   throughout our lifespan,
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.520]   essentially for anything that we want to learn.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.380]   That could be subtracting an emotion
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.080]   from an experience we've had.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.120]   It could be building a greater range of emotion.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.400]   It could be learning new information
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.980]   like learning a new language.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.980]   It could be learning new motor skill like dance or sport,
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.780]   or it could be some combination of cognitive motor.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.900]   So for instance, an air traffic controller
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.120]   has to do a lot with their mind
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.820]   in addition to a lot with their hands.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.380]   So it's not just cognitive,
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.380]   it's not just motor, but combined.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.700]   So we're going to talk about what that chemical is,
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.960]   but to just give you an important hint,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.700]   that chemical is the same chemical of stress.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.940]   This is not a discussion about stress per se.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.420]   In a future podcast episode,
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.940]   we'll talk all about stress and tools to deal with stress.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.740]   It's something my lab works on quite extensively.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.300]   And it's a topic that I enjoy discussing.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.740]   But this is a topic about brain change.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.060]   And what I just told you is that
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.260]   in order to change the brain,
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.140]   you have to pay careful attention.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.080]   And the immediate question should be, well, why?
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.640]   Well, the answer is that when we pay careful attention,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.380]   there are two neurochemicals,
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.700]   neuromodulators as they're called,
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.000]   that are released from multiple sites in our brain
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.260]   that highlight the neural circuits
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.420]   that stand a chance of changing.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.680]   Now, it's not necessarily the case
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.740]   that they're going to change,
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.820]   but it's the first gate that has to open
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.300]   in order for change to occur.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.720]   And the first neurochemical is epinephrine, also adrenaline.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.240]   We call it adrenaline when it's released
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.700]   from the adrenal glands above our kidneys,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.540]   that's in the body.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.980]   We call epinephrine in the brain,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.760]   but they are chemically identical substances.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.060]   Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.960]   called locus coeruleus.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.820]   Fancy name, you don't need to know it unless you want to.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:51.460]   Locus coeruleus sends out these little wires we call axons,
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.980]   such that it hoses the entire brain, essentially,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.340]   in this neurochemical epinephrine.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.700]   Now, it's not always hosing the brain with epinephrine.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.460]   It's only when we are in high states of alertness
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.420]   that this epinephrine is released.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.980]   But the way this circuit is designed,
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.220]   it's very nonspecific.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.300]   It's essentially waking up the entire brain.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.400]   And that's because the way that epinephrine works
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.980]   by binding particular receptors
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.220]   is to increase the likelihood that neurons will be active.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.180]   So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.580]   However, alertness alone is not sufficient,
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.020]   as we would say it's necessary,
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.480]   but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.180]   We know this is true also from the work of Hubel and Wiesel,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.880]   where they looked at brain plasticity
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.100]   in response to certain experiences
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.880]   in subjects that were either awake or asleep.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.620]   And I hate to break it to you,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.900]   but you cannot just simply listen to things in your sleep
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.220]   and learn those materials.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.040]   Later, I'll talk about how you can do certain things
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.260]   in your sleep that you're unaware of
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.980]   that can enhance learning of things
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.780]   that you were aware of while you were awake,
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.460]   but that is not the same as just listening to some music
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.980]   or listening to a tape while you sleep
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.560]   and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.140]   Epinephrine is released when we pay attention
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.060]   and when we are alert.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.540]   But the most important thing for getting plasticity
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.900]   is that there be epinephrine, which equates to alertness,
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.740]   plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.840]   Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.320]   One is also in the brainstem,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.260]   and it's named different things in different animals,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.480]   but in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.260]   or neurons that make acetylcholine
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.260]   is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.340]   There are a number of different names
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.700]   of these aggregates of neurons.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.900]   You don't need to know the names.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.140]   All you need to know is that you have an area
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.080]   in your brainstem, and that area sends wires,
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.860]   these axons, up into the area of the brain
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.180]   that filters sensory input.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.240]   So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.660]   and it is getting bombarded
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.060]   with all sorts of sensory input all the time.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.340]   Costello's snoring off to my right,
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.460]   the lights that are in the room,
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.780]   the presence of my computer to my left.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.340]   All of that is coming in,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.240]   but when I pay attention to something,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.120]   like if I really hone in on Costello's snoring,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.720]   I create a cone of attention,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.640]   and what that cone of attention reflects
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.980]   is that acetylcholine is now amplifying the signal
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.600]   of sounds that Costello is making with his snoring
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.120]   and essentially making that signal greater
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.600]   than all the signal around it.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.800]   What we call signal to noise goes up.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.440]   So those of you with an engineering background
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.060]   will be familiar with signal to noise.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.800]   Those of you who do not have an engineering background,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.620]   don't worry about it.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.000]   All it means is that one particular shout in the crowd
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.100]   comes through, Costello's snoring becomes more salient,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.340]   more apparent relative to everything else going on.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.720]   Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.940]   but epinephrine for alertness,
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.420]   acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs,
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.640]   those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   There needs to be this third component,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.700]   and the third component is acetylcholine released
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.180]   from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.320]   If you really want to get technical,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.240]   it's called nucleus basalis of minort.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.740]   For any of you that are budding physicians
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.040]   or going to medical school, you should know that.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.000]   If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.300]   acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis and epinephrine,
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.540]   you can change your brain.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   And I can say that with confidence
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.740]   because Mersennek and Recanzone,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.420]   as well as other members of the Mersennek lab,
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.240]   Michael Kilgard and others, did these incredible experiments
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.860]   where they stimulated the release of acetylcholine
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.620]   from nucleus basalis, either with an electrode
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.020]   or with some other methods that we'll talk about.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.120]   And what they found was when you stimulate
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.200]   these three brain regions, locus coeruleus,
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.660]   the brainstem source of acetylcholine,
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.360]   and then the basal forebrain source of acetylcholine,
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.260]   when you have those three things,
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.960]   whatever you happen to be listening to,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.960]   doing or paying attention to, immediately in one trial
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.200]   takes over the representation
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.060]   of a particular area of the brain,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.160]   you essentially get rapid, massive learning in one shot.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.520]   And this has been shown again and again and again
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.780]   in a variety of papers,
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.600]   also by a guy named Norm Weinberger from UC Irvine.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.520]   And it is now considered a fundamental principle
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.740]   of how the nervous system works.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.020]   So while Hubel and Wiesel talked about critical periods
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.940]   in developmental plasticity,
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.300]   it's very clear from the work of Merzenich and Weinberg
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.260]   and others that if you get these three things,
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.160]   if you can access these three things
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.040]   of epinephrine, acetylcholine from these two sources,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.700]   not only will the nervous system change, it has to change.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.140]   It absolutely will change.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.860]   And that is the most important thing
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.740]   for people to understand if they want to change their brain.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.540]   You cannot just passively experience things.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.420]   And repetition can be important,
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.920]   but the way to use repetition to change your brain
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.540]   is fundamentally different.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.940]   So now let's talk about how we would translate
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.460]   all the scientific information and history
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.860]   into some protocols that you can actually apply,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.700]   because I think that's what many of you are interested in.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.360]   And I'm willing to bet that most of you are not interested
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.740]   in lowering electrodes into your nucleus basalis.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.300]   And frankly, neither am I.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.020]   In episode one of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.500]   I described the various ways that people can monitor
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.260]   and change their nervous system.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.580]   Those ways include brain machine interface,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.460]   pharmacology, behavioral practices.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.440]   And those behavioral practices, of course,
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.960]   can include some dos, do this, and some don'ts,
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.440]   don't do that, et cetera.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.660]   In thinking about neuroplasticity,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.240]   I want to have a very frank conversation
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   about what one can do,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.880]   but also acknowledge this untapped capacity
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   that I'm just not hearing about out there,
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.340]   which is one can also combine behavioral practices
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.560]   with pharmacology.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.460]   One can combine behavioral practices
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.160]   with brain machine interface.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.140]   And you don't have to do that.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.800]   In fact, I'm not recommending you do anything in particular.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.060]   As always, I'll say it again.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.280]   I'm not a physician, so I don't prescribe anything.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.240]   I'm a professor, so I profess a lot of things.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.960]   What you do with your health and your medical care
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.800]   is up to you.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.660]   You're responsible for your health and wellbeing.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.480]   So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to take.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.320]   I'm going to describe what the literature tells us
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.020]   and suggests about ways to access plasticity.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.360]   We know we need epinephrine.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.640]   That means alertness.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.000]   Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.140]   and a good night's sleep.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.860]   So I will say you should master your sleep schedule
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.220]   and you should figure out how much sleep you need
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.100]   in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.160]   All the tools and more science
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.540]   than probably you ever wanted to hear about sleep
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.760]   and how to get better at sleeping
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.880]   and timing your sleep, et cetera, and naps,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.800]   and all of that is in episodes two, three, four, and five
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.000]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.720]   So I encourage you to refer to those
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.280]   if your sleep is not where you would like it to be.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.460]   Your ability to engage in deliberate focused alertness
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.260]   is in direct proportion to how well you are sleeping
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.360]   on a regular basis.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.240]   I think that's kind of an obvious one.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.160]   So get your sleep handled.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.560]   But once that's in place,
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.960]   the question then is how do I access this alertness?
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.400]   Well, there are a number of ways.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.920]   Some people use some pretty elaborate
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.440]   psychological gymnastics.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   They will tell people that they're going to do something
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.120]   and create some accountability.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.320]   That could be really good.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.460]   Or they'll post a picture of themselves online
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.500]   and they'll commit to learning a certain amount,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.100]   losing, excuse me, a certain amount of weight
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.260]   or something like this.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.720]   So they can use either shame-based practices
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.280]   to potentially embarrass themselves
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.300]   if they don't follow through.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.400]   They'll write checks to organizations that they hate
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.760]   and insist that they'll cash them
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.480]   if they don't actually follow through.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.280]   Or they'll do it out of love.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.920]   They'll decide that they're going to run a marathon
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.080]   or learn a language or something
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.360]   because of somebody they love
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.520]   or they want to devote it to somebody.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.040]   The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.860]   and getting alert and activated, it doesn't really matter.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.560]   Epinephrine is a chemical and your brain does not distinguish
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.680]   between doing things out of love or hate, anger or fear.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.500]   It really doesn't.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.480]   All of those promote autonomic arousal
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.720]   and the release of epinephrine.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.320]   So I think for most people,
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.720]   if you're feeling not motivated to make these changes,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.080]   the key thing is to identify not just one,
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.200]   but probably a kit of reasons.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.120]   Several reasons as to why you would want
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.800]   to make this particular change.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.640]   And being drawn toward a particular goal
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.200]   that you're excited about can be one.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.640]   Also being motivated to not be completely afraid,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.840]   ashamed or humiliated for not following through on a goal
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.800]   is another.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.920]   Just want to briefly mention one little aside there
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.800]   because I've got a friend who's a physician.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.400]   He's a cardiologist who has a really interesting theory.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.220]   This is just theory,
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.280]   but I think it will resonate with a lot of people,
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.120]   which is that you've all heard of this molecule dopamine
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.720]   that gives us this sense of reward
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.100]   when we accomplish something.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.800]   Well, we also want to be able to access dopamine
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.000]   while we're working towards things.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.720]   Enjoy the process, as they say,
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.760]   'cause it has all sorts of positive effects.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   It gives us energy, et cetera.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.420]   With my friend, what he says is,
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.720]   there's many, many instances where someone will come to him
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.560]   and say, "You know what?
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.800]   I'm going to write a book."
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.320]   And he says, "Oh, that's great.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.600]   I'm sure the book's going to be terrific
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.880]   and you really should write a book."
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.900]   And then they never go do it.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.200]   And his theory is if you get so much dopamine
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.880]   from the reward of people saying,
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.880]   "Oh yeah, you're absolutely going to be able to do that,"
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.260]   you might not actually go after
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.000]   the reward of the accomplishment itself.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.440]   So beware these positive reinforcements also.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.200]   Not saying people should flagellate themselves
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.840]   to the point of victory in whatever they're pursuing,
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.340]   but motivation is a tricky one.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.360]   So I suggest that everyone ask themselves,
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.480]   what is it that I want to accomplish?
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.620]   And what is it that's driving me to accomplish this?
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.240]   And come up with two or three things, fear-based perhaps,
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.200]   love-based perhaps, or perhaps several of those
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   in order to ensure alertness, energy,
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.840]   and attention for the task.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.040]   And that brings us to the attention part.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.400]   Now it's one thing to have an electrode
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.340]   embedded into your brain
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.760]   and increase the amount of acetylcholine.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.580]   It's another to exist in the real world
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.780]   outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing,
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.960]   having trouble bringing your attention
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.560]   to a particular location in space for a particular event.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.600]   And there's a lot of discussion nowadays
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.160]   about smartphones and devices
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.120]   creating a sort of attention deficit
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.160]   almost at a clinical level for many people,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.740]   including adults.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.520]   I think that's largely true.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.240]   And what it means, however,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.000]   is that we all are responsible for learning
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.860]   how to create depth of focus.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.840]   There are some important neuroscience principles
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.760]   to get depth of focus.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.000]   I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.360]   because I always get asked about this.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.720]   People say, what can I take
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.760]   to increase my levels of acetylcholine?
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.520]   Well, there are things you can take.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.160]   Nicotine is called nicotine
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.660]   because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.400]   There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.480]   muscarinic and nicotinic,
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.920]   but the nicotinic ones are involved
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.660]   in attention and alertness.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.080]   I have colleagues.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.640]   These are not my kind of like bro science buddies.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.160]   I have those friends too.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.020]   This is a Nobel prize winning colleague
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.360]   who choose Nicorette while he works.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   He used to be a smoker.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.760]   He quit smoking because of fear of lung cancer.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.220]   It's like a smart choice.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.880]   But he missed the level of focus
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.100]   that he could bring to his work.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.060]   This is somebody who's had a very long career.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.880]   And if you ever meet with him,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.040]   unfortunately I can't name him.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.880]   If you ever meet with him,
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.720]   what you realize is he choose
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.500]   about five pieces of Nicorette an hour,
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.800]   which I am not suggesting people do.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.100]   But when I asked him, why are you doing this?
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.220]   He said, well, increases my alertness and focus.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.080]   And also his theory, and I want to really underscore
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.580]   that it's theory not scientifically supported yet
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.880]   is that it offsets Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.660]   It is true that nucleus basalis is the primary site
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.880]   of degeneration in the brain
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.320]   in people that have dementia and Parkinson's.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.700]   And it's what leads to a lot of their inability
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.600]   to focus their attention, not just deficits in plasticity.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.400]   So he might be onto something.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.600]   Now I've tried chewing Nicorette.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.240]   It makes me super jittery.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.580]   I don't like it because I can't focus very well.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.940]   It kind of takes me too far up
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.740]   the level of autonomic arousal.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.020]   I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day,
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.300]   some of whom are scientists.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.220]   Writers and artists and musicians
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.320]   are familiar with the effects of nicotine
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.120]   from the era where a lot of people smoked
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.640]   and fortunately fewer people smoke now.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   So if you're interested in the pharmacology,
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.960]   there are supplements and things
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.720]   that can increase cholinergic transmission in the brain.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.920]   I'm not suggesting you do this,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.500]   but if you're going to go down that route,
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.940]   you want to be very careful
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.460]   how much you rely on those all the time.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.040]   Because the essence of plasticity
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.360]   is to create a window of attention and focus
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.520]   that's distinct from the rest of your day.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.680]   That's what's going to create a mark in your brain
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.960]   and the potential for plasticity.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.860]   Things that increase acetylcholine besides nicotine
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.880]   or Nicorette, the nicotine could come
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   from a variety of sources,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.400]   or things like alpha-GPC or choline.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.420]   There are a number of these things.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.700]   I would encourage you to go to examine.com, the website,
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.040]   and just put in acetylcholine
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.000]   and it will give you a list of supplements
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.060]   as well as some of the dangers of these supplements
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.260]   that are associated with cholinergic transmission.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.000]   But I would be remiss and I would be lying
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.560]   if I didn't say that there are a lot of people out there
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.160]   who are using cholinergic drugs
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   in order to increase their level of focus.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.180]   And since we're coming up on the Olympics,
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.280]   I don't want to get anyone in trouble,
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   but I'm well aware that the fact that the sprinters
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.940]   are really into cholinergic drugs
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.280]   because not only is acetylcholine important
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.200]   for the focus that allows them to hear the gun
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.360]   and be first out the blocks on the sprints,
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.040]   that's a lot of where the race is won.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.680]   Hearing that gun and being quickest on reaction time,
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.800]   so they take cholinergic agents for that,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.980]   as well as acetylcholine is the molecule
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.480]   that controls nerve to muscle contraction.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.760]   So your speed of reflexes is actually controlled
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.240]   by this nicotinic transmission as well.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.760]   So lots to think about in terms of acetylcholine
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.980]   in sport and mental acuity, not just plasticity.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.460]   Now, for most of you,
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.200]   you probably don't want to chew Nicorette,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.440]   definitely don't want to smoke cigarettes
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.360]   or take supplements for increasing acetylcholine.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.900]   So what are some ways that you can increase acetylcholine?
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.440]   And there, it's going to sound
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.640]   like a bit of a circular argument,
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.840]   but you want to increase focus.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.880]   How do you increase focus?
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.780]   People are so familiar with sitting down,
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.100]   reading a couple of pages of a book
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.880]   and realizing that none of it sunk in
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.580]   or talking to someone and seeing their mouth move,
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.560]   maybe even nodding your head subconsciously
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.340]   and coming, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and none of it sinks in.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.020]   This can be very damaging for school, work performance
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.240]   and relationships, as many of you know.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.940]   Costello, incidentally, never seems to pay attention
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.420]   to anything I say while looking directly at me,
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.100]   which contradicts what I'm about to say,
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:59.960]   which is that the best way to get better at focusing
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.420]   is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:08.340]   And the key principle here is that mental focus
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.280]   follows visual focus.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.720]   We are all familiar with the fact that our visual system
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.420]   can be unfocused, blurry, or jumping around,
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.400]   or we can be very laser focused on one location in space.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.620]   What's interesting and vitally important to understanding
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.580]   how to access neuroplasticity
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.400]   is that you can use your visual focus
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.820]   and you can increase your visual focus
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.540]   as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.000]   more broadly.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.760]   So I'm gonna explain how to do that.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.780]   Plasticity starts with alertness.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.140]   And as I mentioned before, that alertness can come from
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.480]   a sense of love, a sense of joy, a sense of fear,
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.380]   doesn't matter.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.680]   There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness too.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.500]   The most common one is of course caffeine,
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.340]   which if you watch the sleep episodes,
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.880]   you know reduces this molecule that makes us sleepy
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.720]   called adenosine.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.160]   I drink plenty of caffeine, I'm a heavy user of caffeine.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.020]   I don't think abuser of caffeine.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.100]   I think in reasonable amounts
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.140]   provided we can still fall asleep at night.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.220]   Caffeine can be a relatively safe way
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.640]   to increase epinephrine.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.960]   Now, many people are now also using Adderall.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.420]   Adderall chemically looks a lot like amphetamine.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.900]   And basically it is amphetamine.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.300]   It will increase epinephrine release from locus coeruleus,
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.820]   it will wake up the brain.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.620]   And that's why a lot of people rely on it.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:38.420]   It does have a heavy basis for use
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.760]   in certain clinical syndromes prescribed
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.060]   such as attention deficit.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.500]   However, it also has a high probability of abuse,
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.020]   especially in those who are not prescribed it.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.620]   Adderall will not increase focus, it increases alertness.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.460]   It does not touch the acetylcholine system.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.840]   And if those of you that are taking Adderall say,
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.500]   well, it really increases my focus overall,
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.900]   that's probably because your autonomic nervous system
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.800]   is just veering towards what we call parasympathetic.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.340]   You're really just very sleepy
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.100]   and so it's bringing your levels of alertness up.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.580]   As I mentioned, Adderall is very problematic
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:14.920]   for a number of people.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.660]   It can be habit forming.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.900]   Learning on Adderall does not always
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.400]   translate to high performance,
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.520]   off or on Adderall at later times.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.160]   And the Adderall discussion is a broader one
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.500]   that perhaps we should have
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.340]   with a psychiatrist in the room at some point
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.220]   because it is a very widely abused drug
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.460]   at this point in time.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:38.160]   The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.380]   is available, as I mentioned, through pharmacology,
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.660]   but also through these behavioral practices.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.700]   And the behavioral practices
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.660]   that are anchored in visual focus
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.740]   are going to be the ones that are going to allow you
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.780]   to develop great depth and duration of focus.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.540]   So let's think about visual focus for a second.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:01.200]   When we focus on something visually, we have two options.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.780]   We can either look at a very small region of space
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.620]   with a lot of detail and a lot of precision,
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.100]   or we can dilate our gaze
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.140]   and we can see big pieces of visual space
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.260]   with very little detail.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.100]   It's a trade-off.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.220]   We can't look at everything at high resolution.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.460]   This is why we have these,
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.900]   the pupil more or less relates to the fovea of the eye,
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.060]   which is the area in which we have the most receptors,
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.060]   the highest density of receptors that perceive light.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.680]   And so our acuity is much better
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.820]   in the center of our visual field than in our periphery.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.300]   It's a simple experiment you can do right now.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.000]   If you're listening to this, you can still do it.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.860]   You can hold your hands out in front of you,
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   provided that you're sighted.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.180]   You should be able to see how many fingers
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.580]   you have in front of you.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.100]   For me, it's five, still got all five fingers.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.260]   Amazingly enough, if I move my hand off to the side,
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.660]   and I can't see them with precision,
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.020]   but as I move them back into the center of my visual field,
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.460]   I can see them with precision.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.100]   And that's because the density,
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.040]   the number of pixels in the center of my visual field
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.340]   is much higher than it is in the periphery.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.260]   When we focus our eyes, we do a couple things.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.260]   First of all, we tend to do that
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.500]   in the center of our visual field,
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.960]   and our two eyes tend to align
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.360]   in what's called a vergence eye movement
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.480]   towards a common point.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.800]   The other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.460]   so that our brain now no longer sees
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.620]   the entire visual world,
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:18.380]   but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery.
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.580]   If it, that was the dog bumping into the wall, forgive me.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.940]   That small cone of visual imagery or soda straw view
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.120]   of the world has much higher acuity, higher resolution
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.760]   than if I were to look at everything.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.860]   Now you say, of course, this makes perfect sense,
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:37.360]   but that's about visual attention, not mental attention.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.340]   Well, it turns out that focus in the brain
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.860]   is anchored to our visual system.
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.380]   I'll talk about blind people in a moment,
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.040]   but assuming that somebody is sighted,
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.300]   the key is to learn how to focus better visually
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.140]   if you want to bring about higher levels
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.940]   of cognitive or mental focus,
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.500]   even if you're engaged in a physical task.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.460]   Now there's a remarkable phenomenon in animals
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.120]   where animals that have their eyes
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.740]   on the side of their head
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.200]   are scanning the entire visual environment all the time.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.300]   They're not focused on anything.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.620]   Think you're grazing animals, your cows, your sheep,
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.080]   your birds, et cetera.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.380]   But think about a bird picking up seeds on the beach
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.100]   or on concrete.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.380]   That bird's head is up here.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.960]   It's up about a foot off the ground,
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.660]   or if it's a small bird, about six inches off the ground,
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.380]   and its eyes are on the side of its head,
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.840]   and yet it has this tiny beak
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.220]   that can quickly pick up these little seeds off the ground
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.420]   with immense precision.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.120]   Now, if you try to do that
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.280]   by staring off to the sides of the room
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.260]   and picking up items in front of you with high precision
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.220]   at that tiny scale, little tiny objects,
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.260]   you will miss almost every time.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.300]   They do it perfectly,
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.020]   and they don't smash their beak into the ground
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:46.860]   and damage it.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.460]   With beautiful movement acuity also.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.880]   So how do they do it?
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.340]   How do they create this focus
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.140]   or this awareness of what's in front of them?
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.760]   It turns out as they lower their head,
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.180]   their eyes very briefly move inward
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.260]   in what's called a virgin's eye movement.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.900]   Now, their eyes can't actually translocate in their head.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.500]   They're fixed in the skull, just like yours and mine are.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.940]   But when we move our eyes slightly inward,
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.140]   maybe you can tell they're doing it like so,
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.120]   basically shortening or making the interpupillary distance,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.020]   as it's called, smaller, two things happen.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.260]   Not only do we develop a smaller visual window
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.100]   into the world, but we activate a set of neurons
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.980]   in our brainstem that trigger the release
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.100]   of both norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.260]   Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrine.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.560]   So in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head,
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.400]   when we're just kind of looking
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.560]   at our entire visual environment, moving our head around,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.580]   moving through space, we're in optic flow,
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.200]   things moving past us, or we're sitting still,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.780]   we're looking broadly at our space, we're relaxed.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.200]   When our eyes move slightly inward
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.940]   toward a particular visual target, our visual world shrinks,
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.100]   our level of visual focus goes up,
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.080]   and we know that this relates
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.760]   to the release of acetylcholine and epinephrine
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.860]   at the relevant sites in the brain for plasticity.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.660]   Now, what this means is that if you have a hard time
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.220]   focusing your mind for sake of reading or for listening,
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.740]   you need to practice, and you can practice,
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.820]   focusing your visual system.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.800]   Now, this works best if you practice focusing
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.480]   your visual system at the precise distance
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.660]   from the work that you intend to do for sake of plasticity.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.860]   So how would this look in the real world?
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.180]   Let's say I am trying to concentrate
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.200]   on something related to, I don't know, science.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.000]   I'm reading a science paper and I'm having a hard time,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.840]   it's not absorbing.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.140]   I might think that I'm only looking at the paper
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.980]   that I'm reading, I'm only looking at my screen,
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.420]   but actually my eyes are probably darting around a bit.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.020]   Experiments have been done on this.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.460]   Or I'm gathering information from too many sources
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.860]   in the visual environment.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.900]   Now, presumably, 'cause it's me, I've already had my coffee,
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.940]   I'm hydrated, I'm well-rested, I slept well,
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.120]   and I still experience these challenges in focusing.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.920]   on a small window of my screen,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.720]   meaning just on my screen with nothing on it,
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.080]   but bringing my eyes to that particular location
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.320]   increases not just my visual acuity for that location,
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.500]   but it brings about an increase in activity
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.840]   in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.340]   with gathering information from this location.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:38.060]   So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus,
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.080]   practice visual focus.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.400]   Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.480]   that's fine, you of course would wanna use those.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.020]   You don't wanna take those off and use a blurry image.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.940]   The finer the visual image,
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.720]   and the more that you can hold your gaze
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.040]   to that visual image,
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.320]   the higher your levels of attention will be.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.660]   Many times on Instagram, and here I've been teased
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.080]   for not blinking very often,
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.980]   that's actually a practiced thing.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.220]   We blink more as we get tired,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.600]   which as you hear it, you'll probably just say duh.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.180]   As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.760]   that are responsible for alertness
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.520]   and that hold the eyelids open start to falter
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.820]   and our eyelids start to close.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.500]   This is why it's hard, the words,
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.280]   I could barely keep my eyes open,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.000]   which may be how you feel right now.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   But assuming that you're paying attention and you're alert,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.980]   when you're very alert, your eyes are wide,
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.480]   your eyes are open.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.200]   And as you get tired, your eyelids start to close.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.520]   Blinks actually reset our perception of time and space.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.680]   This was shown in a beautiful paper in Current Biology.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.600]   I'll be sure to post the reference in the notes.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.200]   And blinking, of course, is necessary to lubricate the eyes.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.440]   People blink because their eyes might get dry.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.240]   But if you can keep focus by blinking less
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.420]   and by focusing your eyes to a particular location
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.260]   that's probably pretty creepy for you to experience
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.400]   as I'm doing this.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.920]   But the more that you can do this,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.720]   the more that you can maintain a kind of a cone
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.920]   or a tunnel of mental focus.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.880]   And so I'm sort of revealing my practice,
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.280]   which is that I've worked very hard through blinking contests
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.960]   with my 14 year old niece who still beats me every time
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.920]   and it really bothers me,
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.740]   but also just through my own self-practice
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.560]   of learning to blink less and focus my visual attention
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.040]   on a smaller region of space.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.760]   Now, for me, that's important
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.100]   because I'm mainly learning things on a computer screen.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:28.560]   If you're going to be doing sport,
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.480]   it's quite a bit different
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.620]   and we can discuss how you might translate that to sport.
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.300]   In fact, in the next episode,
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.960]   I'm going to talk all about how plasticity
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.560]   and the focus mechanisms relate
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.880]   to learning of movement practices and coordinated movements.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.880]   It's an entire discussion unto itself,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.020]   but the same principle holds.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.940]   So we need alertness.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:50.240]   You can get that through mental tricks of motivation,
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.540]   fear or love, whatever it is.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.680]   Pharmacology, please do it healthfully.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.720]   Caffeine, if that's in your practice.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.380]   Certainly want to be well hydrated.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.300]   That increases, it actually will increase alertness.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.140]   Having a very full bladder will increase alertness,
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.000]   although you don't want your alertness to be so high,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.280]   do that, all you can think about it
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.160]   is the fact that you have to go urinate
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.560]   'cause that's very distracting.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.020]   You don't want your alertness to go through the roof.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.140]   You need focus and visual focus is the primary way
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.280]   in which we start to deploy these neurochemicals.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.840]   Now, you may ask, well, what about the experiment
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.140]   where people were feeling this rotating drum
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.440]   or listening to the auditory cue?
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.800]   That doesn't involve vision at all.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.760]   Ah, if you look at people who are learning things
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.240]   with their auditory system,
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.840]   they will often close their eyes
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.360]   and that's not a coincidence.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.100]   If somebody is listening very hard,
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.000]   please don't ask them to look you directly in the eye
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   while also asking that they listen to you.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.400]   That's actually one of the worst ways
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.320]   to get somebody to listen to you.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.560]   If you say, now listen to me and look me in the eye,
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.760]   the visual system will take over
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.920]   and they'll see your mouth move,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.060]   but they're going to hear their thoughts
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.700]   more than they're going to hear what you're saying.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.000]   Closing the eyes is one of the best ways
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.620]   to create a cone of auditory attention.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.200]   And this is what low vision or no vision folks do.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.080]   They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.120]   in particular locations.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.340]   Incidentally, does anyone know the two animals
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.060]   that have the best hearing in the world?
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.560]   The absolute best hearing,
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.120]   many orders of magnitude better than humans.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.320]   Turns out it's the elephant that might not surprise you.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.000]   They have huge ears and the moth,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   which probably will surprise you.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.260]   I didn't even know that moths could hear,
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.760]   but now it explains why they're so hard to catch.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.560]   If you are not sighted,
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.940]   you learn how to do this with your hearing.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.200]   If you're somebody who braille reads,
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.840]   you learn how to do this with your fingers.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.840]   If you look at great piano players like Glenn Gould,
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.700]   they oftentimes will turn their head to the side.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.600]   You think about some of the great musicians
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.520]   that like Stevie Wonder, that were blind, right?
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.360]   He would look away
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.480]   because he had no reason to look at the keys,
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.760]   but oftentimes they'll orient an ear
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.240]   or one side of their head to the keys on the piano.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.160]   As I mentioned before,
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.640]   people who are non-sighted have better pitch.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.680]   So we have these cones of attention that we can devote.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.320]   And for most people, vision is the primary way
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.000]   to train up this focus ability and these cones of attention.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.600]   So you absolutely have to focus
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.200]   on the thing that you're trying to learn.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.480]   And you will feel some agitation
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.120]   because of the epinephrine in your system.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.200]   If you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.720]   and you're feeling like you're not doing it right,
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.840]   chances are you're doing it right.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.700]   And you can practice this ability to stare
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.840]   for long periods of time without blinking.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.040]   I know it's a little eerie for people to watch,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.080]   but if your goal is to learn how to control
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.120]   that visual window for sake of controlling your focus,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.360]   it can be an immensely powerful portal
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.440]   into these mechanisms of plasticity
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.800]   because we know it engages things like nucleus basalis
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.080]   and these other brainstem mechanisms.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.480]   I get a lot of questions about
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.720]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.040]   and attention deficit disorder.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.540]   Some people actually have clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.900]   And if you do, you should certainly work
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.120]   with a good psychiatrist to try and figure out
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.160]   the right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices for you.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.260]   Many people, however, have given themselves
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.800]   a low-grade ADHD or ADD
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.840]   because of the way that they move through their world.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.400]   They are looking at their phone a lot of the time.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.220]   It's actually very easy to anchor your attention
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.780]   to your phone for the following reason.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.520]   First of all, it's very restricted in size.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.000]   So it's very easy to limit your visual attention
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.280]   to something about this big.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.840]   It's one of the design features of the phone.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.800]   The other is that just as you've probably heard,
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.000]   a picture is worth a thousand words.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.760]   Well, a movie is worth 10,000 pictures.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.400]   Anytime we're looking at things
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.780]   that have motion, visual motion,
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:49.220]   our attentional system will naturally gravitate
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.960]   towards those movies.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.080]   It's actually much harder to read words on a page
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.400]   than it used to be for many people
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.480]   because we're used to seeing things spelled out for us
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.200]   in YouTube videos or videos where things move
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.920]   and are very dramatic.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.640]   It is true that the more that we look
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.980]   at those motion stimuli,
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.500]   the more that we're seeing movies of things
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.680]   and things that are very dramatic and very intense,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.080]   the worse we're getting at attending to things
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.220]   like text on a page
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.120]   or to listening to something like a podcast
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.620]   and extracting the information.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.160]   So much so that I think many people have asked me,
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.120]   why aren't you providing intense visuals for us to look at?
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.540]   Well, frankly, it's because a lot of people
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.160]   are consuming this content through pure auditory,
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.500]   through just by listening,
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.400]   and I want them to be able to digest all the material.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.920]   But in addition to that,
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.580]   if you think about the areas of life
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.980]   that dictate whether or not we become successful,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.400]   independent, healthy individuals,
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.700]   most of those involve the kind of boring practices
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.300]   of digesting information on a page.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.480]   Boring because it's not as exciting in the moment perhaps
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.680]   as watching a movie or something being spoonfed to us.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.760]   But the more attention that we can put to something,
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.820]   even if it's fleeting
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.320]   and we feel like we're only getting little bits and pieces,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.640]   shards of the information as opposed to the entire thing,
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.360]   that has a much more powerful effect
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.420]   in engaging this cholinergic system for plasticity
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.300]   than does, for instance, watching a movie.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.460]   And that's because when we watch a movie,
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.520]   the entire thing can be great, it can be awesome,
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.240]   it can be this overriding experience.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.180]   But I think for all those experiences,
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.700]   if you're somebody who's interested in building your brain
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.580]   and expanding your brain
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.640]   and getting better at various things,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.320]   feeling better, doing better, et cetera,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.860]   one has to ask how much of my neurochemical resources
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.120]   am I devoting to the passive experience
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.660]   of letting something just kind of overwhelm me and excite me
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.000]   versus something that I'm really trying
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.520]   to learn and take away.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.360]   And now there's another,
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.480]   I enjoy movie content and TV content all the time.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.720]   I scroll Instagram often.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   But we are limited in the extent
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.360]   to which we can grab ahold
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.760]   of these acetylcholine release mechanisms or epinephrine.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.300]   And I think that we need to be careful
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.400]   that we don't devote all our acetylcholine and epinephrine,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.200]   all our dopamine for that matter,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.220]   to these passive experiences of things
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.080]   that are not going to enrich us and better us.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   So that's a little bit of an editorial on my part,
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.800]   but the phone is rich with movies,
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.120]   it's rich with information.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   The real question is, is the information rich for us
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.640]   in ways that grow us and cultivate smarter,
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.640]   more emotionally evolved people,
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.440]   or is it creating,
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.440]   what's it doing for our physical wellbeing for that matter?
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.920]   So I don't want to tell people what to do or not to do,
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.960]   but think carefully about how often you're focusing
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.680]   on something and how good you are or poor you are
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.760]   at focusing on something that's challenging.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.800]   So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness,
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.880]   you get the acetylcholine released
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.040]   and you can focus your attention,
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.640]   then the question is for how long?
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.120]   And in an earlier podcast,
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.880]   I talked about these ultradian cycles
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.640]   that last about 90 minutes.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.680]   The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.540]   I think that learning bout will no doubt include
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.560]   five to 10 minutes of warmup period.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.820]   I think everyone should give themselves permission
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.360]   to not be fully focused in the early part of that bout,
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.240]   but that in the middle of that bout,
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.220]   for the middle hour or so,
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.840]   you should be able to maintain focus
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.240]   for about an hour or so.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.880]   So that for me means eliminating distractions.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.720]   That means turning off the wifi.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.340]   I put my phone in the other room.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.540]   If I find myself reflexively getting up to get the phone,
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.680]   I will take the phone and lock it in the car outside.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.860]   If I find myself going to get it anyway,
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.520]   I am guilty of giving away the phone for a period of time
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.840]   or even things more dramatic.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.700]   I've thrown it up on my roof before,
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.720]   so I can't get to it till the end of the day.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.220]   That thing is pretty compelling.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.600]   And we come up with all sorts of reasons
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.520]   why we need it to be in contact with it.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.240]   But I encourage you to try experiencing what it is
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.400]   to be completely immersed in an activity
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.920]   where you feel the agitation that your attention is drifting
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.500]   but you continually bring it back.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.680]   And that's an important point,
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.520]   which is that attention drifts,
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.800]   but we have to re-anchor it.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.280]   We have to keep grabbing it back.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.160]   And the way to do that if you're sighted is with your eyes.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.960]   That as your attention drifts and you look away,
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.220]   you want to try and literally maintain visual focus
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.600]   on the thing that you're trying to learn.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.180]   Feel free to blink, of course,
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.720]   but you can greatly increase your powers of focus
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.640]   and the rates of learning,
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.320]   which is anchored in all the work of Merseneck,
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.540]   Hubel and Wiesel and others.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.080]   Now that's the trigger for plasticity,
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.720]   but the real secret is that neural plasticity
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:46.520]   doesn't occur during wakefulness, it occurs during sleep.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   We now know that if you focus very hard on something
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.020]   for about 90 minutes or so,
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:56.120]   maybe you even do several bouts of that per day,
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.600]   if you can do that, some people can,
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.920]   some people can only do one focus bout of learning.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.760]   That night and the following nights while you sleep,
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.720]   the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will,
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.600]   with acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.720]   and other ones will be lost,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.760]   which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.520]   And what it means is that when you eventually wake up
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.680]   a couple of days or a week later,
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.520]   you will have acquired the knowledge forever,
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.120]   unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.720]   And we will talk about unlearning in a later episode.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.840]   So mastering sleep is key
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.880]   in order to reinforce the learning that occurs.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.200]   But let's say you get a really poor night of sleep
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.960]   after a bout of learning.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.400]   Chances are if you sleep the next night
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.480]   or the following night, that learning will occur.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.960]   There's a stamp in the brain
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.560]   where this acetylcholine was released.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.540]   It actually marks those synapses neurochemically
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.240]   and metabolically so that those synapses
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.880]   are more biased to change.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.120]   Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep,
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.420]   then you probably won't get those changes.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.580]   There's also a way in which you can bypass the need
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.360]   for deep sleep, at least partially,
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.600]   by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest,
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.420]   these NSDR protocols.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.880]   But I just want to discuss the science of this.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.920]   There was a paper that was published
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.120]   in Cell Reports last year that shows that if people did,
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.440]   it was a spatial memory task,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.280]   actually a quite difficult one where they had to remember
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.380]   the sequence of lights lighting up.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.920]   And if there are just two or three lights
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.140]   in a particular sequence, it's easy.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.920]   But as you get up to 15 or 16 lights
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.080]   and numbers in the sequence,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.880]   it actually gets quite challenging.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.320]   If immediately after, and it was immediately after
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.040]   the learning, the actual performance of this task,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.040]   people took a 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.020]   or took a shallow nap,
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.600]   so lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.360]   just closing their eyes, no sensory input,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.840]   the rates of learning were significantly higher
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.180]   for that information than to just had a good night's sleep
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.220]   the following night.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.840]   So you can actually accelerate learning
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.440]   with these NSDR protocols or with brief naps,
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.200]   90 minutes or less.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:09.000]   So the key to plasticity in childhood is to be a child.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.280]   The key to plasticity in adulthood is to engage alertness,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.160]   engage focus, and then to engage non-sleep deep rest
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.760]   and deep sleep while you're in your typical bout of sleep.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.960]   I always get asked,
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.360]   how many bouts of learning can I perform?
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.160]   Well, I know people that train up these visual focus
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.480]   mechanisms to the point where they can do
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.140]   several 90-minute bouts throughout the day,
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.760]   as many as three or four.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.080]   And some of them are also inserting
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.160]   non-sleep deep rest as well.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.520]   Now that can get pretty tricky.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.040]   A lot of people find that they can recover best
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.840]   from these intense bouts of focused learning
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.540]   by doing some motor activity,
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.920]   where you get into self-generated optic flow.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.120]   And that should make sense if you've ever heard me lecture
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.600]   about stress, which I've done a little bit
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.060]   in various podcasts.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.360]   When we are in a mode of self-generated optic flow,
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.900]   like walking or running or cycling,
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.680]   and things are just floating past us on our retina,
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.260]   we're not really looking anywhere in particular.
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.000]   So this is the opposite of a tight window of focus.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.680]   When we do that, there are areas of the brain
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.640]   like the amygdala, which are involved
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:18.800]   in releasing epinephrine and create alertness.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.600]   At the extremes, it creates fear, but certainly alertness.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.840]   Those all shut down.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.920]   So it's its own form of non-sleep deep rest.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.600]   So some people find it much more pleasurable and practical
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.320]   to engage in a focused bout of learning
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.880]   and then go do some activity that involves
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.480]   what we would essentially call wordlessness,
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.180]   where you're not really thinking about much of anything.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.920]   And so for those of you that listen to audio books
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.300]   or podcasts while you run, you may want to consider
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.200]   whether or not that's how you want to spend your time.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.240]   Now, I'd love it if you were listening to this podcast
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.340]   while you run or cycle, but I'm much more interested
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:55.280]   in you actually getting the benefits of neuroplasticity
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.120]   than just listening to me for sake of listening to me.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.540]   So for many people, letting the mind drift
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.720]   where it's not organized in thought
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.360]   after a period of very deliberate focused effort
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.200]   is the best way to accelerate learning
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.080]   and depth of learning.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.280]   And there are good scientific data
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.500]   to support these sorts of things,
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.160]   including the cell reports paper
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.320]   that I mentioned a few moments ago.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.200]   I want to synthesize some of the information
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.460]   that we've covered up until now.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.200]   This entire month is about neuroplasticity.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.560]   Today's episode has covered a lot,
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.240]   but by no means has it covered all of the potential
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.460]   for neuroplasticity and protocols for plasticity.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.240]   We will get into all of it.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.520]   But today I want to make sure that these key elements
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.020]   that form the backbone of neuroplasticity
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.540]   are really embedded in people's minds.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.480]   First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.600]   Early from birth until 25,
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.300]   mere exposure to a sensory event can create plasticity.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.560]   That could be a good thing or a bad thing.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.680]   We're going to talk about unlearning the bad stuff,
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.320]   traumas, et cetera, in a subsequent episode this month.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.880]   If you want to learn as an adult, you have to be alert.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.120]   It might seem so obvious,
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.640]   but I think a lot of people don't think about
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.860]   when in their 24 hour cycle they're most alert.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   There are four episodes devoted to that 24 hour cycle
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.960]   and the cycles of alertness and sleep.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.100]   I encourage you to listen to those
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:27.040]   if you haven't had the opportunity to yet,
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.080]   or just ask yourself when during the day
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.180]   do you typically tend to be most alert?
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.920]   That will afford you an advantage
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.920]   in learning specific things during that period of time.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.680]   So don't give up that period of time
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.240]   for things that are meaningless, useless,
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.000]   or not aligned with your goals.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.200]   That'd be a terrible time to get into passive observance
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.220]   or just letting your time get soaked away by something.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.120]   That is a valuable asset.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.100]   That epinephrine released from your brainstem
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.840]   is going to occur more readily at particular phases
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.560]   of your 24 hour cycle than others,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.360]   during the waking phase, of course.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.600]   You should know when those are.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.200]   And then you could start to think about
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.160]   the behavioral practices, maybe the pharmacologic practices
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.000]   like caffeine, hydration, et cetera,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.140]   that will support heightened levels of alertness.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.880]   Attention is something that can be learned.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.260]   And attention is critical for creating that condition
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.220]   where whatever it is that you are engaging in
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.400]   will modify your brain in a way
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.300]   that you won't have to spend so much attention on it
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.140]   going forward.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.240]   That's the essence of plasticity,
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.060]   that things will eventually become reflexive.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.600]   The language that you're learning,
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.440]   the motor movement, the cognitive skill,
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.480]   the ability to suppress an emotional response
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.180]   or to engage in emotional response,
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.620]   depending on what your goals are
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.160]   and what's appropriate for you.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.660]   Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.720]   pharmacologically through nicotine.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.000]   However, there are certain dangers
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.920]   for many people to do that,
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.860]   as well as a cost, a financial cost.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:05.580]   Learning how to engage the cholinergic system
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.040]   through the use of the visual system.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.000]   Practicing how long can you maintain focus
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.080]   with blanks as you need them.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.940]   But how long can you maintain visual focus on a target,
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.240]   just on a piece of paper set a few feet away in the room
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.980]   or at the level of your computer screen.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.440]   These are actually things that people do in communities
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.560]   where high levels of visual focus are necessary.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.480]   Now, the other way to get high levels of visual focus
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.240]   and alertness is to have a panic
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.900]   or to have a situation that's very, very bad.
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.200]   You will be immediately focused
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.620]   on everything related to that situation.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.620]   But that's unfortunate.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.840]   What we're really talking about here
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.500]   is trying to harness the mechanisms of attention
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.560]   and get better at paying attention.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.220]   You may want to do that with your auditory system,
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.900]   not with your visual system,
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.280]   either because you're low vision or no vision,
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.640]   or because you're trying to learn something
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.600]   that relates more to sounds than to what you see.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.920]   But for most people,
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.160]   they're trying to learn information, cognitive information,
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.760]   or they're trying to learn how to hear the nuance
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.940]   in their partner's explanations
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.820]   of their emotionally challenging events, et cetera.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.040]   And just remember, by the way, what I said earlier,
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.180]   which is that if you really want somebody to listen to you
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.480]   and really hear what you're saying and what's underlying it,
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.720]   you should not and cannot expect them
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.320]   to look directly at you while you do that.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.600]   That's actually going to limit their ability to focus.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.160]   I'm trying to rescue a few folks out there
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.320]   who might be in this struggle.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.520]   I, of course, have never been in this struggle.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.420]   I think that was supposed to be a joke.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.940]   I'm very familiar with that struggle.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.440]   But I know that one can get better at listening,
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.180]   one can get better at learning,
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.700]   one can get better at all sorts of things
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.080]   by anchoring in these mechanisms.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.600]   Now, of course, you can also combine protocols.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.400]   You can decide to combine pharmacology
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.680]   with these learning practices.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.320]   Many people in communities do that.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.040]   Many people are doing that naturally
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.240]   by drinking their coffee right before they do their learning.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.620]   But I would also encourage you to think about
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.160]   how long those learning bouts are.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.780]   If you think you have ADD or ADHD,
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:09.240]   see a clinician, but you should also ask yourself,
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.200]   are you giving up the best period of focus
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.060]   that you have each day naturally
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.400]   to some other thing like social media
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.080]   or some other activity that doesn't serve you well?
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.880]   Or are you devoting that period to the opportunity to learn?
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.200]   You should also ask yourself
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.640]   whether or not you're trying to focus too much
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.360]   for too long during the day.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.320]   I know some very high-performing individuals,
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.040]   very high-performing in a variety of contexts,
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.940]   and none of them are focused all day long.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.140]   Many of them take walks down the hallway,
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.420]   sometimes mumbling to themselves
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.920]   or not paying attention to anything else.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.080]   They go for bike rides, they take walks.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.380]   They are not trying to engage their mind
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.840]   at maximum focus all the time.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.960]   Very few people do that
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.580]   because we learn best in these 90-minute bouts
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.640]   inside of one of these ultradian cycles.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.760]   And I should repeat again that within that 90-minute cycle,
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.320]   you should not expect yourself to focus
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.360]   for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.840]   The beginning and end are going to be
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.820]   a little bit flickering in and out of focus.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.020]   How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.480]   is starting?
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.500]   Well, typically when you wake up
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.080]   is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle,
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.800]   but it's not down to the minute.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.100]   You'll be able to tap into your sense
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.360]   of these 90-minute cycles as you start to engage
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.400]   in these learning practices, should you choose.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.820]   And then of course, getting some non-sleep deep rest
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.040]   or just deliberate disengagement,
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   such as walking or running
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.320]   or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open,
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.520]   kind of mindlessly, it might seem in a chair,
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.880]   just letting your thoughts move around
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.540]   after a learning bout will accelerate
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.440]   the rate of plasticity that's been shown
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.460]   in quality peer-reviewed studies.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.840]   And then of course, deep sleep.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.880]   And so what we can start to see is that
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   plasticity is your natural right early in life,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.840]   but after about age 25,
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.440]   you have to do some work in order to access it.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.260]   But fortunately, these beautiful experiments
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.340]   of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich and Weinberger and others
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.980]   point in the direction of what allows us
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.400]   to achieve plasticity.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.600]   It points to the neurochemicals and the circuits.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.800]   And we now have behavioral protocols
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.040]   that allow us to do that.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.700]   I also really want to emphasize
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.740]   that there's an entire other aspect of behavioral practices
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.220]   that will allow us to engage in plasticity,
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.880]   that don't involve intense focus and emotionality,
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.600]   but involve a lot of repetition.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.900]   So there's another entire category of plasticity
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.120]   that involves doing what seemed like almost mundane things,
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   but doing them over and over again, repeatedly,
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.160]   and incorporating the reward system that involves dopamine.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.120]   So today I talked about the kind of plasticity
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.740]   that comes from extreme focus.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.480]   You would get that extreme focus and alertness naturally
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.280]   through a hard or difficult event that you didn't want.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.480]   That's the kind of stinger,
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.100]   but your brain is designed to keep you safe.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.180]   So it wants to get one trial learning
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.000]   from things like touching a hot stove
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.360]   or engaging with a really horrible person.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:12.400]   You can get incredible plasticity of positive experiences
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:15.980]   of things that you want by engaging this high focus regime
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.420]   and then rest, non-sleep deep rest and sleep.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.540]   And there's another aspect of plasticity
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.380]   which we will explore next episode,
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.980]   as well as when we explore movement-based practices
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.520]   for enhancing plasticity and plasticity of movement itself.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.860]   And those are not of the high attention,
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:40.160]   kind of high emotionality or in the intensity
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.360]   of the experiences that I described today.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.940]   Those are more about repetition and reward and repeat.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.760]   Repetition, reward, repeat.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.380]   And they are used for a distinctly different category
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.640]   of behavioral change, more of which relate to habits
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.720]   as opposed to learning of particular types of information
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.720]   that allow us to perform physically, cognitively
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.560]   or adjust our emotional system.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.400]   So I'm going to stop there.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.680]   I'm sure there are a lot of questions.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.920]   Please put your questions in the comment section below
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   and please remember that this entire month
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.080]   we're going to be exploring neuroplasticity.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.440]   So this discussion/lecture,
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.920]   I wish it was more of a back and forth,
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.820]   but this is what the format offers us.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.340]   So please do put your questions in the comment section
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.460]   and I will address them in the other episodes coming soon
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.440]   on neuroplasticity.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.620]   As I say that, I'm reminded that many of you
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.660]   are listening to this on Apple or Spotify
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.020]   and therefore there isn't an opportunity to leave comments
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.780]   aside from the rating section on Apple.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:48.320]   So if you have specific topics related to neuroplasticity
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.660]   that you would like me to cover
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.800]   in the subsequent episodes this month,
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.660]   please go to the YouTube, subscribe,
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:57.080]   but as well, please put your question
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.840]   in the comment section for this episode
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.680]   and I'll be sure to read them and respond.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.540]   Many of you have very graciously asked
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:06.720]   how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.320]   Best way to do that is to subscribe on YouTube.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.400]   You might want to also hit the notification button
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.440]   so that you don't miss any upcoming episodes.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.640]   Leave a comment.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.200]   As well, if you go to Apple,
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.140]   you can give us a five-star rating
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.440]   and there's a place there
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.180]   where also you can leave a comment.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.920]   And if you prefer to listen on Spotify,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.400]   subscribe and download on Spotify.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.500]   In addition, it's always helpful if you recommend the podcast
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.280]   to your friends and family and others
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.960]   who you think might benefit from the information.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.000]   And as well, please check out our sponsors.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.040]   That's a great way to help us.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.120]   Today and in previous episodes,
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.680]   I've talked a number of times about supplements.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.200]   I'm very pleased that we're partnering with Thorne,
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.840]   T-H-O-R-N-E supplements
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.120]   because Thorne has the very high levels of stringency
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.160]   in terms of product quality and precision
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.880]   about how much of given supplements are in the bottle,
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.800]   which is vital.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.640]   And not all supplement companies
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.320]   have stood up to the test on that one.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.560]   If you want to check out Thorne and go to Thorne,
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.560]   that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.960]   And if you do that,
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.440]   you'll get 20% off any supplements that you purchase.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.640]   I've also listed there a gallery of supplements that I take,
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.320]   including magnesium glycinate.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.840]   I know in previous episodes,
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.000]   I talked about magnesium threonate
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.800]   as a sleep aid that I take.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.560]   Magnesium glycinate and magnesium threonate
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.840]   are essentially interchangeable.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.280]   Thanks so much for your time and attention.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.120]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.700]   [upbeat music]
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.280]   (upbeat music)
