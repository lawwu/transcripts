[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.540]   A woman from the United Arab Emirates who wishes to remain anonymous writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.220]   John, what does it mean in Exodus 20 verse 5 that God visits the iniquity of the fathers on the children?
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.100]   Does this refer to generational sins or generational curses?
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.820]   How does this principle relate to us and to our children under the new covenant?
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.600]   Will my children somehow be punished for my own sins?"
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.060]   I suppose we should get the texts, the relevant texts, in front of us,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.340]   including the one that she mentioned.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.000]   Exodus 25 goes like this, "I the Lord your God am a jealous God,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.480]   visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.660]   but showing steadfast love to
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.720]   thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments." And Exodus 34 6,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.260]   "The Lord visits the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation."
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.120]   Leviticus 26 39,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.260]   "Because of their iniquity and also because of the iniquities of their fathers,
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.700]   they shall rot away like them."
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.880]   However, there are other texts which are absolutely crucial for sorting out what the Bible means in those first texts.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.180]   Deuteronomy 24 16, "Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children,
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.220]   nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers." Or
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.800]   2 Kings 14 6, "Amaziah did not put to death the children of the murderers,
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.620]   according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord commanded, 'Fathers shall not be put to death
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.940]   because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.780]   sin.'" Or Ezekiel 18 20, "The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father,
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.640]   nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son." So there you have the two
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.120]   clusters of texts that are both true, both inspired by God, and both
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.040]   infallible. How do they fit together? And what can we learn about
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   so-called generational sins? So here are my observations. Number one, the sins of the fathers are
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.360]   punished in the children
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920]   through becoming the children's own sin.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.080]   That's really crucial. So here's the key text. I'll just read Exodus 20 verse 5 again.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.680]   "I, the Lord, visit the iniquity of the fathers on
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.720]   the children to the third and fourth generation of
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.680]   those who
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   hate me."
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.520]   In other words, the hatred of God is the embodiment of
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   what the father's problem was.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.880]   Those who experience the penalty of
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.360]   the father's sins are those who hate God in that verse.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.400]   We are not told how
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.160]   the father's sins become the children's sins.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.880]   That's a mysterious thing left in God's
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   mind, but they do. What we're told is that when father's sins are
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.520]   visited on the children, it is because the children have become
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.720]   sinners like the fathers. The father's sins are the children's sins, and so
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.680]   no
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   innocent child has ever been punished for a father's sins. Only
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.960]   guilty children are punished, and they are guilty with the very sins that their fathers
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.560]   sinned. That's the first observation.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   The second is because of God's grace,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   which is, of course, finally secured for us by
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.400]   Jesus on the cross, the children
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.720]   can confess their own sins and the sins of their fathers and be forgiven and
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.240]   accepted by God.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   Nobody is trapped. Nobody is trapped in his father's sins or his own sins.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.640]   So here's—we already see it in the Old Testament, Leviticus 2640.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.440]   If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.320]   if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.240]   then I will remember my
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.680]   covenant with Jacob. So nobody in the Old Testament or the New, under the New Covenant, is
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.280]   trapped or enslaved or in bondage or under an unbreakable curse
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.560]   because of something the fathers did or something they did.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.680]   The precious words of Exodus 34 6 are not nullified by generational
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   migration of sin. It says, "The Lord, the Lord, a God
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.600]   merciful and gracious,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.760]   slow to anger,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.760]   abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands." And then, as if to get the point across,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.000]   he gives three words—forgiving iniquity and forgiving transgression and forgiving sin.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.440]   I mean, you can't get clearer at the center of the Mosaic Law that from generation to generation,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.000]   God forgives the sins of those who repent.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.760]   Third observation,
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.440]   none of this should make anyone feel trapped and without hope because of his parents' sins. Ezekiel
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.320]   33 14, "When I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.560]   he shall surely live. He shall not die." And the blood of Jesus
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.280]   conquers all
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:36.040]   sin and judgment for those who believe. And you get a beautiful sweeping statement in Acts 10
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.880]   43,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.480]   "To him,"
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.240]   Jesus, "all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.160]   receives
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.760]   forgiveness of sins through his name." So, nobody is trapped in
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.640]   anybody's sin—their own or someone else's—because of the cross. The fourth thing I would say is
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.120]   no one who has a child
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.360]   who goes bad and
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.520]   forsakes the way of righteousness
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.440]   should feel that it's all his fault.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.520]   Ezekiel 18 20, in other words, "Well, I guess my sins were just visited on that child."
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.920]   Ezekiel 18 20 says, "The father will not bear the punishment for the son's
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   iniquity." In other words, there are real responsibilities in our children's hearts, and
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.480]   we will not be found
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.200]   guilty because of our children's guilt, if we deal, of course, with our own sins.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.440]   Which means that you can't be paralyzed
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:54.200]   by the guilt of thinking, "I guess my children's problems are all owing to me."
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.400]   And the last thing I would say is,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.120]   finally,
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   when it comes to generational curses,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.080]   Christians should lay hold on
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.560]   Galatians 3 13,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.320]   "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   by becoming a curse for us.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.000]   For it is written,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.600]   'Curse it is everyone who's hanged on a tree.'" Christ has paid
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.040]   every debt and broken every curse.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.200]   And the key is to believe that and act on it. The blood of
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.520]   Christ covers all curses. I remember going to the hospital one
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.320]   New Year's Eve night
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.240]   when the third heartache and tragedy had come into one of the young families of our lives, and
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:51.000]   they wondered, "How worse can it get?" And the father took me out in the hall from the place where his child was dying and
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.480]   said, "Pastor John,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.080]   can a Christian be under a curse?"
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:03.120]   He just felt, "I don't know any explanation for why so many bad things are happening to me." And I said,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.360]   "You
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.720]   may tonight be free from any kind of curse, from God's law, or any
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:20.520]   voodoo, or any hex, because Christ bore every curse for you." Brought him great comfort,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.320]   and they worked their way through that in a wonderful way.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.200]   Wow, what a story to bring this home, and
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.520]   what a Savior we have in Christ. Thank you for explaining this, Pastor John.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   And tomorrow we're gonna return to talk about what our hope in eternal purity in the presence of Jesus Christ
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.880]   does to our present purity right now.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and I will see you tomorrow. And as always, find more about the Ask Pastor John podcast online at
