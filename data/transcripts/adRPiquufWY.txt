[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   I was so internalizing the message to just get on with things and get out of the way
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.380]   that I forgot to introduce myself.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.920]   I'm Christine Benz, and I am Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning at Morningstar.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.320]   I'm also the President of the Board of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.520]   I'm thrilled to introduce Rick Ferry, who has been my partner in planning this conference
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.600]   for the past couple of years.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360]   Rick is a prolific author.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   He has how many books, Rick?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Six?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.200]   Six books, with a focus on asset allocation and low-cost investing.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   He hosts the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, and he has an investment advisory practice
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.160]   that is hourly, which is a little bit different and difficult to find.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.360]   He was my predecessor as President of the Board on the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.520]   Literacy and has donated a ton of his time to Bogleheads over the years.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:25.560]   Rick is going to talk to us about investment selection.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.800]   Thank you again for coming to the conference, and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.040]   I know you're going to get an awful lot of information over the next three days.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.700]   This conference used to only be two days; now it's three days.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.000]   My talk today is on investment selection, which is how do you actually go about investing
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.680]   in the things that Alan talked about?
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.960]   I'm going to give you just a quick review of investments that are out there.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.440]   I call these things the income-producing investments, which is trying to loan Alan $1,000 and hope
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.080]   you get it back.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   Income-producing investments, that's all they do is produce income, would be treasury bonds,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.820]   corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, municipal bonds, and so forth.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.800]   These are loaning people money, and they pay you back with interest and eventually get
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.000]   your money back.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's the idea.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.360]   Those are the income-producing investments.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.400]   First I'm going to go over, again, the list of different investments that are out there
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.880]   in the public markets, meaning you can go buy this stuff in the public markets.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.640]   Not loaning it to Alan, that would be a private investment, but in the public markets, these
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.720]   are the things that you can buy.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.960]   The next type of investment pays both dividends and it has growth.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.760]   It could go up in value, and that is U.S. stocks, international stocks.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.160]   You own part of these companies.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.360]   Extra limited partnerships are like stock, a little bit complicated on the tax side,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.080]   but the idea is you are a partner in a company, and it's a publicly traded company, so the
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.580]   stock is, if you will, publicly traded on the exchange.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.160]   Then there's real estate that you can buy on public exchanges, and they're called REITs,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.040]   Real Estate Investment Trusts, where you can get paid rents, and those rents flow through
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.160]   to you, treated a little bit differently for taxes, but again, all of this stuff you can
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.440]   buy in the public markets, on the stock market, or the over-the-counter type markets.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280]   And then there's these things that just change price, the more speculative things.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.200]   They don't pay any dividends, they don't pay any interest.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.520]   You are buying something with the hope that it goes up in value, and then you turn around
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.700]   and sell it at a higher price.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.280]   So anything you buy, somebody else is selling, and anything you are selling, somebody else
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   is buying, and as Alan said, it's a zero-sum game.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.360]   There's no real growth in that, and that would be commodities, precious metals, collectibles,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.760]   maybe a little bit different with collectibles.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.920]   That, by the way, you can't get on the public market, there are very few available out there.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.600]   And currencies, including the cyber currencies, like the Bitcoins and things like that.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   The idea is you buy them at one price, they go up in value, you sell them at another price,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:27.540]   you make money, and you're buying and selling based on price only, no cash flow is coming
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.080]   off of those things.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.880]   So publicly available investments.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.840]   Now, my talk today is about how you buy.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.560]   Those are the what's, that's what you can buy, and now this is how you can buy them.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.720]   So this is a pretty structured market out there, pretty structured.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.000]   The first way you can buy them is direct.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.540]   So you go to the stock exchange, and you buy individual securities, you buy physical metals.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.120]   So you're buying Apple stock on the stock exchange, you're buying Google stock on the
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   stock exchange.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.300]   You open up a brokerage account, and you buy stock.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.200]   You could open up a brokerage account and buy treasury bonds, you can buy individual
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.860]   corporate bonds, you can buy mortgages.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.720]   All of these individual securities trade, and if you have a brokerage account someplace,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.240]   you can buy them in your brokerage account.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.960]   You can buy Bitcoin, you can buy gold through an exchange-traded fund.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.080]   You can buy real estate through real estate investment trusts.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.160]   So they're mostly exchange-traded, they're fully liquid.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.960]   If you bought them now, you could sell them 10 minutes from now, if you wish.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.800]   You would pay a small commission or so, or a spread between the bid and the ask price
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.600]   when you sold them, because there's a market maker in the middle, so that's the cost of
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   trading.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   So you could buy individual direct, or you could buy them in a partnership.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.360]   Okay, now what is a partnership?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.760]   This is where you get together with 500 or less individuals, other investors, and you
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.640]   buy a piece of a partnership.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.760]   Usually what trades inside of a partnership are things like real estate, private real
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.480]   estate, not real estate that's traded on the market, venture capital, hedge funds, and
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   so forth.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   It's generally, these partnerships are securities that you can purchase, but they're not very
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   liquid.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.920]   There's usually a general partner who gets paid a fairly high fee.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.280]   You'll get your money back eventually, hopefully, and there is a market for these things, but
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.860]   it's not liquid like the stock market or the bond market.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.820]   So partnerships are another way you can pool your money, or really the first way, you pool
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.800]   your money with 500 or so other people, and you go out and you buy these different things
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.640]   in the partnership, and now you own a piece of it.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.960]   You don't have any say in how the partnership actually works, but you get the cash flow
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.640]   from it, if there is cash flow.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.120]   You get the appreciation if there's appreciation because there's somebody that's managing that
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.040]   partnership for you.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.240]   That's called a limited partnership.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   Okay, one more.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   Let's go.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   Okay, now the next thing is a little bit simpler, and that's called a traditional mutual fund.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.040]   These were first created back in 1924, so they've been around now for 100 years, and
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   here's where a company said, "You know, we can go out and we can buy stocks, and we can
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.200]   pool them together in one account, and we can invite people to buy into that account,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.120]   to buy shares of that account."
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.080]   Pretty much an unlimited number of people.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.000]   So you get a company like a Fidelity, Massachusetts Investment Trust, or any number of mutual
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.400]   fund companies who create a pool of capital, and they sell shares of that pool to you,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.160]   and it's liquid on a daily basis.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.560]   You can buy these shares at the end of the day.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.840]   You could sell them at the end of the next day, and you will own a large number of stocks,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.160]   or if it's a bond mutual fund, you'll own the bonds in there.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.280]   There's all 4,000 different types of mutual funds.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.960]   Some of them are actively managed, like Alan was saying.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.200]   Some of them are index funds, and mutual funds are the most common investment in 401(k) plans,
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.440]   403(b) plans, 457 plans, things that you have at work.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.400]   They're mutual fund investments, traditional mutual funds, and they have liquidity at the
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.640]   end of the day at what's called net asset value.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.120]   Now, there's a manager of that fund, and they charge a management fee.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   Some of them are high management fees, and some of them are very low, like the index
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.600]   fund management fees, and that's how the people who are managing that pot of money get paid.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   So this is a mutual fund.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.400]   Sometimes there's a commission to buy them.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.360]   If it's in your 401(k) or 403(b) or 457 plan, there's not going to be a commission, but
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.840]   mutual funds are what you'll find in those plans.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.400]   All right, the last thing is relatively new.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   It's only been around for about, call it 25 years now, I think it is.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.760]   It's called an exchange-traded fund, an exchange-traded fund.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.160]   This, first and foremost, is a mutual fund.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.720]   It's a pot of money that is being managed in stocks or bonds, but the big difference
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.660]   between an exchange-traded fund and a traditional mutual fund is the exchange-traded fund is
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.760]   trading shares on the exchange, on an exchange.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.720]   During the day when the market is open is when you buy exchange-traded funds and sell
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.300]   exchange-traded funds, whereas traditional mutual funds, you're buying and selling at
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:54.240]   a price that is determined after the market closes, so that's the big difference.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   Exchange-traded funds trade on an exchange during the day.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:05.520]   They're kept very tight as far as the value of what the fund is trading at is very tight
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.000]   to what the market is trading at and the underlying securities they're trading at through this
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.200]   arbitrage mechanism that actually goes on in the ETF industry.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.960]   I don't want to get into the mechanics of it, but just feel pretty safe if you're buying
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.680]   and selling exchange-traded funds in the middle of the trading day, not at the beginning or
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.900]   the end, but in the middle of the trading day, that you're going to get fairly good
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.940]   pricing when you're buying and selling your exchange-traded funds.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:35.880]   This is very popular in taxable accounts, because a lot of people like to get on their
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.160]   Vanguard account or Schwab account or Fidelity account.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480]   They like to buy something like a bond fund or a stock fund, and they like to know exactly
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.560]   how much they paid for it right then and there, and you would do that with an exchange-traded
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   fund.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.640]   If you bought a mutual fund in your Schwab account or you bought a mutual fund in your
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.320]   Vanguard account, you wouldn't know what you paid for it until the end of the day, because
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.280]   that's when it's priced.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.700]   If you're doing rebalancing, which Alan talked about, when the market goes down, you want
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.280]   to sell bonds and buy more stocks, and when the market goes up, you want to sell some
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.240]   stock and buy more bonds, and you want to be super quick about how you do that, then
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.920]   you could do it with exchange-traded funds.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.000]   You just get right on your Vanguard account, you get right on your Schwab account or your
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.320]   Fidelity account.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.120]   You could sell a few shares of the stock fund to buy a few shares of the bond fund to rebalance
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.140]   your portfolio, and you're done.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.600]   Most of the brokerage firms don't charge anything for a commission to buy and sell ETFs, but
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.180]   there is a very small spread between what you would pay for the fund, the shares, and
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:44.360]   what you would sell them for, maybe a penny a share.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.600]   Those are the mechanisms of getting into the markets, the public markets, the stock market,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   bond market, partnership market.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.120]   These are the ways that people do it.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   Okay.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.400]   Now, Alan hit on this a little bit.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:09.280]   I'm going to go into it a little bit more on an advanced slide.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.520]   What is the difference between an actively managed fund and an index fund?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.640]   Alan hit on this a little bit.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.040]   I'm going to dive into it a little bit more.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.480]   Why are bogleheads so kind of gung-ho on using index funds rather than active funds?
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.280]   I'm going to go to the right side first.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.200]   Actively managed fund, let's say a stock fund, actively managed is all about beating the
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   market.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   I want to outperform the whole stock.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.840]   I want to beat the market, beat the benchmark, and I'm going to put my money in a mutual
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.600]   fund or an ETF, or I'm going to go out and buy individual stocks that I think are going
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.000]   to beat the stock market.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.640]   They're going to outperform, okay?
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.240]   Usually if it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the fees internal in that are going to be anywhere
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.600]   between a half a percent to one percent, so they're going to be fairly high.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   You've got to pay a manager, pay a company for their expertise to go out and investigate
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.840]   all these different companies and decide which companies are going to go up, which companies
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.520]   are going to go down, how to put together the portfolio and put it into this fund.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   I mean, you have to pay for all of that research and management of that actively managed fund
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.400]   with the hope of outperforming the stock market.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.840]   Alternatively, you buy the whole market.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.360]   You say, "I don't know how to pick managers who are going to outperform.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.880]   I'm not sure the managers know how to pick stocks that are going to outperform," which
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.360]   I'll show you in a minute, "so I'm just going to buy an index fund, an index fund that covers
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.920]   the entire U.S. stock market or maybe a portion of the market, like the largest 500 stocks,"
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.080]   and they call that the S&P 500 because there's about 3,600 stocks on the stock market, so
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.440]   the largest ones are in the S&P 500.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   That's an index fund.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.240]   You can buy them for bonds, stocks, commodities, I mean, you name it, but what you're doing
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.680]   is you're just buying that basically the entire market, and the fee, the money management
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.800]   fee for the fund manager in the index fund is very, very low.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.160]   As Alan was saying, it's 0.03 percent.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.960]   They're as low as 0.015, and Fidelity actually has some index funds that have a 0 percent
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.680]   management fee, so they're really inexpensive.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   You get broad diversification, and what's the best part about buying index funds, which
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:33.840]   is what the Bogleheads like besides low fee, is that they actually outperform the market.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:42.320]   Here's a little bit of how the S&P 500 index fund is created.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.360]   You have all these stocks that trade on the stock exchange, Google, Home Depot, Apple,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.600]   you name it out there, NVIDIA, blah, blah, blah, on and on and on, there's 3,600 stocks.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.160]   They all trade on a stock market, and that's called the secondary market.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.920]   When these things come public, when a company who has never traded stock before comes public
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.580]   ever, that's called the primary market.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:12.040]   What you see, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, the NASDAQ, the market is up
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.240]   today, the market is down.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.000]   What we're looking at is what's called the secondary market.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.920]   That's the stock that's already public.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.340]   It's already out there, and it's trading between buyers and sellers.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.600]   That's what's going on on the stock market.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.360]   Well, what companies like Standard & Poor's have done is they've kind of ranked these
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.680]   companies by the largest companies, which may be Apple, to the smallest companies, which
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.280]   I can't even tell you, Bob's Bicycle Shop or something might be the smallest company,
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.840]   but they rank them from the largest to the smallest, and what they do is they say, "Let's
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.880]   take the top 500, generally, I mean, there's a little bit of nuances to this, but take
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.600]   the top 500 stocks, and let's call that the S&P 500."
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.000]   Those are the 500 biggest companies, basically, in the United States.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They say, "How did those companies do, relative to their size?"
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.560]   The big companies are going to count more in the S&P 500 than the number 500 company.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:16.440]   The Apple computer will count more in the S&P 500 than whatever the 500th company is.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.840]   Then they take all that, and they rank it, and then every, basically, 15 seconds, they
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:30.120]   calculate what the value of the S&P 500 is, and that is an index.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.680]   They call it the S&P 500, and when those stocks pay dividend, it gets calculated into the
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.720]   total return of the index, and this is where you get your indexes.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.920]   Standard & Poor's S&P is an index provider.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:49.640]   They provide the index that the index funds are going to track, and so you can have an
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.440]   index that tracks 500 stocks.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.400]   You can have an index that tracks 3,600 stocks, and tomorrow, we're going to be talking with
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.860]   Jerry O'Reilly, who is the manager of the Total U.S. Stock Market Index Fund, largest
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:08.600]   mutual fund in the country, in the world, actually, and it tracks about 3,600 stocks.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.960]   Anyway, so here, then, is Vanguard.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.160]   Vanguard comes along, and they say, "I want to use your index, S&P, to create a mutual
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.360]   fund."
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.520]   So they license the index from S&P, and they get all the data from S&P, and they create
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.240]   that mutual fund and that ETF.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.640]   That is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, or the Vanguard 500 ETF, so that's how it all works.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.400]   The stocks come out first, they trade on this market second, the index providers pick them
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.560]   up in an index next, and then the fund provider or the fund sponsor, we call them Vanguard
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:52.680]   or State Street or Fidelity or Schwab or whomever is doing the index fund, licenses the index,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.160]   they create the mutual fund, and they offer those shares to sale to you.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.840]   Now, getting back to the performance of index funds versus the active managers.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   So who wins?
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.480]   Are the active managers able to pick stocks?
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.040]   This is just U.S. large cap stock mutual funds, U.S. small cap stock mutual funds, international
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.680]   stock mutual funds, real estate mutual funds, government bond mutual funds, corporate bond
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.360]   mutual funds, and municipal bond.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.100]   This is just a sampling of the different categories of mutual funds that are out there.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:37.160]   Over to the right are the percentage of times the index beat the mutual fund.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.040]   So the indexes have beaten the mutual fund, and U.S. large cap, over a five-year period
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:51.160]   of time, 87% of the time, the index has beaten 87% of the mutual funds out there.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.080]   Over a 20-year period of time, 94%.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.920]   So if you're going to hold something for a long term, would you rather try to pick that
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:05.120]   6% of the large cap stock active managers and hope that your fund manager is going to
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.800]   be in that 6% or do you just buy an index fund and you're going to be in the top 10%?
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.240]   And it's not just large cap, it's small cap, and international, and real estate.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.720]   Now we don't have data on 20 years for government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds,
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.200]   but if you look, it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.720]   Over time, the indexes outperform the active managers.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:36.000]   So if you can buy the index rather than use the active managers, there's a high probability
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.940]   your portfolio will do better than going out trying to pick managers or pick funds that
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.120]   are going to outperform.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.880]   So that's why we, the Bogle heads, say this makes a lot of sense to us.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.720]   Jack Bogle created the first U.S. stock market index fund, that S&P 500 index fund I showed
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   you earlier.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:20:03.000]   It has been out since 1976 and it is way up there in the top percentage of large cap funds,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.760]   has outperformed almost everything, and you don't have to do anything.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.200]   Just buy the index fund.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:18.280]   Now this, by the way, was produced by an independent source, Dow Jones S&P, who provides indexes,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.920]   have been gathering this data for years, and so have other companies like Morningstar.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.960]   And Morningstar's data shows the same thing.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   The same thing.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.400]   If you're just buying index funds in all your asset class categories, then you're probably
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.200]   going to outperform trying to beat the market.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.760]   Now I did a study, it's been a while now, but, oh, by the way, one of the reasons why
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.480]   is because, again, what Alan referred to, the active funds have to charge more money.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.600]   They have a lot of people they have to employ to go out and figure out which stocks are
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.040]   going to go up and which stocks are not, so they end up paying on average about .7 percent
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.240]   per year is what it costs to have an active fund because there's a lot of people that
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.800]   need to be paid, whereas an index fund, it's a lot cheaper.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.280]   That difference in cost is the major reason, the biggest reason why the index funds over
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.080]   time outperform the active managers.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.560]   Okay.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.080]   Last slide.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.320]   This is just a study that I did with Alex Benke back 10 years ago now, actually.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.440]   I'd like to see it redone because I think the data's even going to be better.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:34.760]   All I did here was say, if all we did was go out and buy three different index funds,
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:41.240]   a U.S. stock market index fund that covers the whole entire U.S. stock market, an international
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.760]   index fund that covers the whole international stock market, and a bond fund that covers
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.520]   the investment-grade bond market, which is a total bond market index fund, and I just
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.800]   held those three funds, and that's all that I did, or I went out and I tried to pick a
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.320]   U.S. stock fund that was going to beat the market, I tried to pick an international fund
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.760]   that was going to beat the market, and I tried to pick a bond fund that was going to outperform
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   the market.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.360]   Again, this data's from 2012, and it's gotten better.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:17.480]   What is the probability that my portfolio of index funds would outperform that portfolio
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.880]   of my active funds that I was trying to pick?
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.560]   And what we found, at least during that period of time through 2012, I think this is, I want
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:35.640]   to say a five-year period of time, oh, I'm sorry, it was a ten-year period of time from
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:44.400]   2003 to 2012, that 88 percent of the time, the all-index fund portfolio outperformed
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.640]   any other strategy that you could have had to try to go out and beat the market, so trying
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.520]   to pick the active funds.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   And as you go out further and further, as you go out 15 years and 20 years, that line
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.400]   moves all over, these are all the losing portfolios, and these are the winning portfolios.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.480]   So even the winning portfolios didn't win by much.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.360]   There was a few that really did.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.200]   So this is what people are shooting for.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   This is what they see.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.240]   This is what they're trying to, oh, look at that, these funds beat the market by 2 percent
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   per year.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.560]   Okay, there's a possibility you might pick a fund that beats the market by 2 percent
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.120]   per year, but there's a low probability that you will, and you have to understand the difference
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.400]   between possibility and probability.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.160]   And in here, with the Bogleheads, we're all talking about the probability.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   What's the probability you're going to get to your financial independence?
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.060]   What's the probability you're going to get to retirement?
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.300]   If you're using index funds, you have a much higher probability of making more in the markets
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.500]   than you will if you're using a combination of active funds.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:54.420]   So that's the talk today that I have on investment products and why indexing works and why we,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.540]   the Bogleheads, believe in this as part of our philosophy.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.580]   So we have, Bogleheads, we have an investment philosophy, and there are 10 points to it,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.540]   but here are just four of them that fit into what we just talked about today.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.300]   Invest with simplicity.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.660]   Don't make it complicated.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.180]   Make it easy.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.660]   When I leave here, I go next door to the 501 people, and I try to convince them of that
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:22.280]   when I debate Paul Merriman on small-cap value investing and factor investing.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.220]   Keep it simple.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.260]   Secondly, minimize cost and taxes, as Alan talked about.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.100]   Keep that down, and you'll do better.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.580]   Thirdly, use index funds when possible, and last, stay the course.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.140]   Thank you.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.140]   (audience applauds)
