[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.600]   in the book of the Prophet Jeremiah in the seventeenth chapter, reading from verses 5
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600]   to 8.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.400]   Verses 5 to 8 in the seventeenth chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:32.120]   Thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusteth in men, and maketh flesh his own,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:40.640]   and whose heart departeth from the Lord; for he shall be like the heath in the desert,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.280]   and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.040]   when a salt land and not inhabited.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.600]   Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is; for he shall be
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.960]   as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.280]   shall not see when heat cometh; but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful in
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.800]   the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   Now we have already looked at this short paragraph on two previous occasions.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.780]   These were words which were addressed by God through the Prophet Jeremiah to the children
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240]   of Israel.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.600]   And it is important that we should realize something of the circumstances in which they
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.880]   were spoken.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.440]   God had taken this people, you remember, He had made them a nation.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.000]   He had taken that one man, Abram, and had turned him into a nation.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.160]   And He had given them great, exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.760]   He had said, "I will be to you a God, and you shall be to me a people."
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.560]   And He had promised them great and wonderful things.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.080]   But He had also warned them that if they departed from Him, that if they forgot Him, that if
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   they listened to the other nations and followed their way of life, well, as certainly as He
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.640]   would bless them, if they obeyed Him, He would curse them, if they disobeyed Him.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.720]   He had made it quite clear to them at the very beginning.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.200]   But alas, you remember, the story of this people was that they did forget Him.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   They desired other gods, they desired to be like other nations, and they gave themselves
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   to sin.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.360]   They disobeyed God.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   And their life became involved and difficult.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.680]   They became unhappy.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.880]   And here at this particular point in the life of Jeremiah, things really had become desperate.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.480]   There was such a decline in their life as a nation, and a powerful enemy was rising
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   against them, namely the Chaldeans.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.720]   And the whole situation is critical.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.160]   But—and this is the marvelous thing—God has still not left them.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.120]   He still speaks to them.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   He had sent a whole succession of prophets to them, warning them, pleading with them,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.280]   urging them to beware, promising them blessings.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.640]   They wouldn't listen.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   So now He sends the last of the succession, Jeremiah.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   There are foolish, superficial people who don't understand this man nor his book.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.160]   They think he's just a pessimist.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.440]   But there was never a greater realist.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.680]   Jeremiah was given this most uncomfortable task of telling these people that it was the
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.280]   last chance, and that if they didn't accept it, well, that the curse would descend upon
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   them.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.600]   But they wouldn't listen.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.040]   They didn't listen.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.560]   And the curse did descend upon them, and they were carried away, you remember, to the captivity
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.680]   of Babylon.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.200]   However, here in this paragraph we are given the very essence of his message, and it is
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   so typical of the biblical method from beginning to end.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.880]   God's attitude to the children of Israel here is just a picture of his attitude towards
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.560]   the whole of mankind.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.400]   And what God said through Jeremiah to these children of Israel, He is saying still this
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   evening.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.040]   The position remains, I say, exactly as it was.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   One cannot but be amazed at the mercy and the compassion of God, who is so patient with
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   us and so longsuffering.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.120]   Why didn't He abandon these children of Israel long before?
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   Why hasn't He abandoned the world?
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.880]   Why are we not all consumed who do not know Him, in His wrath and in His anger?
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.760]   But God is longsuffering and patient and kind, and He goes on addressing us.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.120]   And He has sent His gospel into the world to plead with mankind, to show them where
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.600]   they are and the way of salvation.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.320]   And nothing is more wonderful than the way in which that message and that truth are presented
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.040]   to us here in the Bible, which is the word of God.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.840]   Our first message, therefore, was this, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.200]   What I am going to say to you tonight is not my idea.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.400]   I haven't thought it out.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.600]   It isn't something that I've conjured up.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   It is simply that which I find in this book.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.840]   It's not my own idea.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.400]   If you quarrel with it, you're not really quarreling with me.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.720]   It's all here.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   I have nothing to do but to unfold this.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.640]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   I know nothing apart from this book.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   Here is my only authority.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yes, it tells us, I say, the whole position, and it puts it so plainly to us that rarely
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.760]   once one has seen it, one can scarcely understand how anybody could possibly fail to see it.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.560]   And yet we know that that is true, that there has been a time in the life of all of us when
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.520]   we haven't seen it.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.920]   I say the Bible puts it so plainly and so clearly.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.360]   It puts it sometimes in definite messages, in instruction.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.720]   It gives us bold and varnished truth.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.640]   Call it doctrine, call it what you like.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.760]   It's here in abundance.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.200]   But Gandhi doesn't stop at that.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   He sometimes puts it in pictures so that though we may not be able to grasp truth and doctrine,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.300]   well, at any rate, we can see a picture.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.120]   And he warns us with his pictures, and he attracts us with his pictures.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.640]   My point is that he uses every conceivable method so that, my dear friends, if any of
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.560]   us here tonight shall ever find ourselves under the curse and the wrath of God to all
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.120]   eternity, we shall be without any excuse at all.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.040]   When the children of Israel found themselves overwhelmed by the Chaldean army and their
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.920]   city destroyed and their great buildings razed to the ground, and they themselves carried
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   away far into Babylon, they had nobody to blame but themselves.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.880]   They'd been told it was coming if they didn't repent.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.800]   There was no excuse whatsoever.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.840]   With a whole succession of prophets, as God puts it, rising up early and sending his servants,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:41.700]   he had warned them in this tremendous manner and had put it so plainly and so clearly.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:49.640]   So that the question that arises, therefore, is why is it that mankind can't see this?
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.000]   What is it that accounts for the fact that so many are living an unhappy life and a life
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.040]   which is patently under the curse of God?
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.720]   Well, it seems to me that certain things are quite clear by way of answer to that question,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.440]   and they're all to be found in this particular paragraph.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.040]   You see, this one paragraph does the two things I've just been saying.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.760]   It gives us the doctrine; it gives us the picture.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.120]   Last Sunday night we were looking at the doctrine.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.680]   Cursed be the man that trusteth in men that maketh flesh his own and whose heart departeth
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   from the Lord.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.120]   That's your doctrine.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.480]   It is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.600]   Again, doctrine.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.200]   And there we saw, we analyzed it together, that the real reason why man's life is as
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.600]   it is today without God is because man has turned his back upon God.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.640]   He's trusting himself instead of trusting God.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.280]   But as I say, God doesn't stop at that.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.840]   He goes on to give us a picture.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.680]   He gives us a picture of the life of the man who doesn't trust in the Lord, and he then
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.840]   gives us the contrast, the picture of the life of the man who does trust in the Lord.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.360]   And that's the thing to which I want to call your attention this evening.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.400]   So that tonight we really are most concerned about verses six and eight.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.960]   We are told about the man who does not trust the Lord but who trusteth in himself and maketh
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.840]   flesh his own, that he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:35.160]   cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabit
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   it.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.480]   On the other hand, we are told that the man who trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:49.000]   Lord is shall be like a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.120]   the river and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green and shall not
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.640]   be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   What perfect pictures.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.280]   How plain, how simple, how direct.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   Therefore I say the question is, why is it that anybody is unhappy in this world tonight?
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.720]   Why is it that anybody's life has gone wrong and is a failure?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   Why is it?
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.880]   Well, the answers are here on the surface, aren't they?
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   One reason must be that they have never really seen their lives as they are.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.280]   They have just never seen it.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.440]   That is, I sometimes suggest the very masterpiece of the devil, that he prevents our seeing
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.720]   ourselves and our lives just as they are.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.120]   You see, we are in it so much and we are so immersed in it, we don't see it.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.760]   If only men and women could see themselves as they are, objectively, and see the kind
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.720]   of life they are living, I verily believe they couldn't continue.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.000]   But the devil prevents that.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.800]   He doesn't allow them to see themselves.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.360]   They have never seen the picture that we are given here.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.840]   If only they could see that life without God is like that, I say they wouldn't continue
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:19.320]   with it, or, to put it the other way round, the trouble is that mankind doesn't see
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.280]   the wonderful possibility which is there awaiting for it in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.720]   It's because they don't realise the glory of the Christian life, the marked contrast
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.440]   provided by this spiritual existence.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   If only men and women really knew the truth about the Christian life, they would desire
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.600]   it, but they have never seen it.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.440]   They have got false ideas about it.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.520]   Their whole vision of it is blurred.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.560]   They can't see the thing truly, and yet here is the picture so plain and clear on
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.120]   the one side and on the other.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.080]   So that I suppose the most important thing of all is this.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:08.000]   Doesn't it seem to be obvious that before people can either see the ungodly life as
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.960]   it is or the godly life as it is, they must undergo a very great change, a revolutionary
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   change, because you see, and I have been emphasising it each Sunday night, the contrast between
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.080]   the two things is an absolute contrast.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.160]   There is no middle position between being a Christian and not being a Christian.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   The one doesn't shade off into the other.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.840]   They are as different as the two pictures that we are looking at this evening.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.640]   They are as different as cursing and blessing, and yet people don't see that.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.720]   Well, I say there is only one explanation of the blindness, and it is that their very
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.960]   natures are wrong.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:58.520]   Now people constantly stumble at this biblical New Testament doctrine of the rebirth, of
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:06.680]   the need of our being born again, of our being regenerated, of our being made anew in the
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.760]   very vitals and essence of our being.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   People say, "Oh, I don't understand that, this sort of being changed."
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.400]   They dislike it, and yet surely the inability to see these two pictures proves that that
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.760]   is an absolute necessity.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.440]   Well, it is in order to try and make that plain and clear that I am calling your attention
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   to these pictures this evening.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.320]   Let me put it like this.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.880]   The one thing that matters in this life and in this world is our relationship to God.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   If our life is a life under a curse, there is only one real reason for that.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.720]   It is that we are not trusting the Lord.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.280]   We are trusting ourselves.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   On the other hand, if we desire the blessings that this godly Christian life offers to us,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:13.720]   well, it is only available on one condition, and that is that we trust the Lord, make him
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:21.760]   his trust, make him our trust, and set our hope in him and in him alone.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.600]   My dear friends, I must emphasize that because there are many people in the world tonight
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.160]   who would like to be blessed.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.120]   There are many people who want everything that the Christian life has got to give.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.520]   Their lives have gone wrong somehow or another, and they are miserable and they are unhappy.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.160]   Then they hear about a gospel that seems to give everything, and they say, "I'd like
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.920]   to have that, I want that."
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.320]   Now you can't have it unless you obey the conditions.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.680]   That is why you notice the doctrine comes before the picture.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.160]   Before we are given the picture of the life of men who are under the curse, we are told
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.520]   why he is under the curse.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.320]   Before we are told about the blessings of the Christian life, we are told how exactly
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.000]   they are to be obtained.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.800]   Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:15.680]   You won't be like this tree by the side of the river unless you trust in the Lord.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.040]   Believing the gospel, believing the truth, is the essential preliminary to any blessing
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   from God.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:30.120]   Very well, then, I say, let us look at these pictures and let us take them in the order
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.760]   in which the scripture gives them.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.560]   Oh, I hope nobody is disappointed because I said that.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.760]   I am afraid there may be some present who say, "Why don't you go straight to that
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   second picture?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.160]   Why do you bother to tell us about that first picture of the life under the curse?
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.120]   Why always talk about sin?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.360]   Why not just tell us about the love of God?"
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   Well, as I say, you are not quarreling with me if you say that it is the scripture and
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.720]   it puts the curse before the blessing.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.320]   It describes the life without God before it describes the life with God.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:12.640]   And of course, for this reason, no one ever becomes a Christian until he or she realizes
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.440]   the truth about the life without Christ.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.600]   And that is the difficulty.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.680]   We don't like facing that.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   It makes us miserable.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.000]   It condemns us.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It makes us unhappy.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   We don't want that.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We want blessings.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.540]   Ah, yes, but no man flies to the Savior except the one who sees that he is lost.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.960]   No one really sees any need of the gospel unless one knows something about the wrath
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   of God against sin.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.040]   So you must start with the way in which it is put here, cursing before blessing, the
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.200]   miserable picture before the happy picture.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.640]   Well, let's look at it.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.880]   I want to show you why this rebirth is an absolute necessity.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.400]   And this is how I do it.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.340]   You see it when you look at the picture of the life of the man who does not make the
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.340]   Lord his trust.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.220]   Here is what I am told about him.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:18.340]   He is like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:25.340]   the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabit it.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.820]   Now, what does all that tell us?
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.740]   Well, let me put that to you in different language.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:36.620]   Let me take the picture with all its details, and let me put it to you in the form of principles
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.980]   to show you what it is teaching.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.740]   It is the essential teaching of the New Testament.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.500]   The life of the man who does not trust in the Lord but who trusts in himself is compared
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.060]   to a heath in the desert, a kind of shrub.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.900]   You know the sort of thing that is meant.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:59.020]   If you have ever been in a sort of uncultivated patch of ground, some kind of desert or wilderness,
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.180]   well, you know the sort of thing that grows there.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:07.860]   There are no trees there, but there are these shrubs, heaths.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.860]   And there they are.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.460]   And we are told that the ungodly is like that.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:19.020]   His life in this world is just like a shrub in the desert.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.540]   What is the truth then about such a man?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:30.740]   Well, the first thing that is true about him is this, that it is a kind of natural life.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.820]   It is a wild kind of life.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.660]   You see, every word of Scripture is tremendously important.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.580]   The contrast is with a tree that has been planted.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.420]   But nobody has planted that shrub in the desert.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.180]   You plant trees in a forest, but you do not plant shrubs.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.100]   You do not plant heaths in the desert.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.540]   They grow by nature.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.300]   They grow in some wild manner.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.300]   Nobody knows how.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.860]   Nobody would ever take the trouble to plant shrubs of that kind.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.820]   But they are just there.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.900]   They come out of the earth as they are.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:09.820]   Now, that is the whole truth, says the Bible, about men as the result of the fall and as
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.060]   the result of sin.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:22.620]   The natural men, the men who live a life without God, in whose case God does not take
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.620]   the central position, and who trust in himself, as we saw last Sunday, he does that without
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.580]   any training at all.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.060]   He does not do it as the result of education.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.000]   He does not do it as the result of cultivation.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.120]   He does it by nature.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.700]   He does it by instinct.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:48.380]   Every man born into this world, since man fell from his first estate and fell from paradise,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:57.180]   every child born into this world is born in sin and shapen in iniquity.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.480]   And it is what it is, without any special attention.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.700]   You do not put your fertilizers and your manures.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.840]   No, no, nothing is ever done to that shrub in the wilderness.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.980]   It just does it all as it were on its own.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.980]   It just comes up.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.980]   It has never been planted.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.940]   It has never had any treatment at all.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.660]   But there it is, and that is what it is like.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:25.220]   And that is man as the result of the fall and as the result of sin.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:31.460]   There is something in us that makes us be what we are.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.140]   There is something in us that makes us do what we do.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.260]   It is the expression of our nature, that which is there inherently comes out.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   It is the natural man.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.260]   It is wild.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.260]   It is uncultivated.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.260]   It is undisciplined.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:56.140]   That is why the first thing a little child always does is something that it should not.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.260]   That is why we all go wrong and float downstream.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.700]   That is why we all sin.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.420]   That is why we all find pleasure in sin.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.140]   That is why there is always something attractive about that which is wrong and that which is
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.140]   prohibited.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.380]   You see, we are like that by nature, like the shrub in the desert.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:22.940]   It is man's full nature coming out and expressing itself.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.820]   And that, according to the Bible, is the explanation of why mankind is as it is.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.900]   Do nothing at all about mankind and that is what you get.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.980]   If God hadn't done something about this world, everybody would be like that and the
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.740]   world would be a living hell.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.860]   There would be no restraints at all.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.980]   Everybody born into it would be giving expression to this kind of life and there it would be.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.980]   Isn't it true?
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.380]   Isn't it true of all of us?
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.840]   Isn't it true of the whole of mankind?
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:59.820]   Can anybody dispute this proposition that we are all born in sin, shaped in iniquity?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.180]   In sin did my mother conceive me.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.220]   It is true of every one of us.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.500]   There is none of us righteous, no, not one.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.860]   We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.060]   Well, what is it then?
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.860]   Well, it must be something wrong in all of us and in all our natures.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:23.700]   By nature we are wild, like the shrub in the desert, and we grow wild and just express
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.900]   the nature that is in us.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.460]   It is rather different, that isn't it, from the Peter Pan view of life, which says that
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:44.460]   we are all born perfectly in a state of sweet innocence, that we are absolutely neutral
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:51.140]   morally unless they would say that we are really very good, and that it is only because
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.580]   of the effect of the environment into which we come that we begin to go wrong.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.860]   Oh, what a tragic fallacy.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.340]   I say again, the first thing even a little child does who has had no time to be influenced
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.500]   by the environment is something you tell it not to.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.820]   No, no.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.300]   Sin is not something that enters into us.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.580]   We start with it.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.740]   We are born in it.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.900]   The whole race is subject to it.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.820]   That is why in spite of all the efforts of mankind to get rid of it, there is no success
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.660]   because the thing is so deep down in the very vitals of the whole being of mankind.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.020]   It is the nature.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.260]   Or let me go on to a second point, which is this.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.420]   You notice the emphasis that is placed here upon the soil.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.380]   There is a wonderful contrast here.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.540]   This godless man is like the heath in the desert.
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.160]   Not only am I told that he is in the desert, he inhabits the parched places in the wilderness
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.420]   and again in a salt land and not inhabited.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:05.020]   What a perfect description that is, if you like, in a geological or almost an agricultural
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   sense.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.020]   That is the analysis of the soil in the wilderness.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.740]   And the kind of product that you get growing there is what it is because that is the sort
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.460]   of soil in which it grows.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.660]   It is the soil that determines it.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.260]   You see at once this is a great principle again in the Bible.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.740]   Our Lord himself used it in his parable of the sower.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.260]   You see he says the thing that matters is not so much the seed as the soil into which
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.400]   it falls.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.380]   Is it hard and trodden upon?
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.500]   Is it covered by briars and thorns and so on?
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   Is it very stony?
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   What is it like?
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.900]   It is the soil that matters.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.900]   Well, here is the same principle here.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.260]   It is everywhere in the Bible.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   I hope to come back to this again, so let me leave it by just putting it like this in
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.220]   passing tonight.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.260]   This according to the Scripture is the absolutely vital thing.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.540]   You see it is the very soil of our life that is wrong.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.780]   It is the very nature, as it were, out of which our life comes.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.620]   It is human nature in its totality that is wrong.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.540]   You say you have difficulty about the doctrine of original sin.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.700]   My dear friend, if you simply thought about these things deeply you would be driven to
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.900]   it.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.140]   When Adam fell, it was not merely one man who fell.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.700]   The whole of humanity fell.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.180]   Human nature fell.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.260]   The whole race went down.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:34.340]   And because the race went down, the soil of our lives is wrong and we are shrubs in the
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.380]   desert in a salt land and not inhabited.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:47.460]   And conversely, as we shall see, it is our proximity to the river that matters.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.980]   If we are to bear fruit in this life and in this world, well then, we must have the kind
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:58.140]   of soil that you find in the rich valleys near the great flowing river which sends out
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.140]   its moisture.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   There is the secret, the proximity to the right kind of soil.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.220]   It determines what grows and the character of the growth.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.260]   But let me come on to something else.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:19.900]   Let us have a general look at this kind of life that is without God.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.460]   And here it is, you see.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:29.380]   What grows in those kind of conditions is what is described as a shrub, a heath, and
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.260]   it is contrasted with a tree.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.900]   And what a striking contrast it is.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.580]   What are the characteristics of a shrub?
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.380]   Well, let me tell you.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.380]   A shrub is always stunted.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.380]   It is always underdeveloped.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.700]   Yes, and unfortunately, I have got to add it, there is always something ugly about a
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.700]   shrub.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.580]   There is no beauty, there is no form, there is no symmetry.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.260]   The trouble with a shrub is, isn't it, that it is neither one thing nor another.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.860]   It is very difficult to classify it.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.660]   It isn't a tree, it isn't a flower.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   What is it?
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.660]   Well, it is something in between the two.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.020]   It doesn't seem to have a real character at all.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.780]   It lacks the character of a great tree, a perfect tree, or indeed of a flower.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.580]   It is something nondescript.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:25.180]   There is an element about it of a monstrosity.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:31.980]   And that is why we none of us like shrubs as such that grow in the desert, in the wilderness,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:38.580]   because in this way it is lacking in form.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.500]   Apply all that to men in sin, and this is what you find, the great teaching of the Bible
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.020]   about men as the result of the fall.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.180]   Man is not what he was meant to be.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.180]   That is the first great truth about him.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.260]   My dear friend, this world was never meant to be as it is tonight.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.580]   Men and women were not meant to be what they are.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.060]   They were never intended to be this sort of thing.
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:15.180]   Man was intended to be the Lord of creation, but he isn't that.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.820]   He patently isn't that.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.380]   He is the victim of it all.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.140]   He is the slave of it.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.340]   He is not the Lord of it, but he was meant to be.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.060]   But the difficulty is about men to know really what to say about him.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.220]   He is exactly, as we are told here, like that shrub in the wilderness, neither one thing
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   nor the other.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.220]   What is man?
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.220]   He is not a god.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.100]   He is not like a god.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.580]   But on the other hand, you can't say that he is a beast.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.100]   He isn't an animal.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.060]   There are times when you look at him and you say, "Well, he is an animal, and he is nothing
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.100]   but an animal, and he even seems to be worse than an animal at times."
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.260]   But then you look at him at other times and look at other aspects, and you say, "No,
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.260]   no, no.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.260]   Man isn't a beast.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.620]   There is a certain ability about him after all, and there is something that suggests
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.980]   bigness and greatness."
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980]   Well, what is he?
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.540]   Well, you can't tell what he is.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.540]   He is not a tree.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   He is not a flower.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:10.180]   He is not in the image of God, and he is not a beast.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.260]   He is something undeveloped.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.260]   He is a monstrosity.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.420]   As the result of sin, man has become nondescript.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.940]   He is neither one thing nor the other.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:29.380]   I say that the obvious thing about him is that there is something stunted about him,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:34.700]   something underdeveloped, and something that is undeveloped.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.140]   Work it out.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:43.520]   I say that man, as the result of sin, is not fully developed mentally.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.440]   We are told about Adam as God made him, that he was able to give names to all the beasts
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.380]   of the earth.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.540]   He was able to understand.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.640]   He was able to commune with God.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.980]   He was able to exercise his mind.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.580]   But man, as the result of sin, is not fully developed mentally.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.040]   Look how men spend their time.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   Look at their occupations.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.860]   Look at the things that excite them.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.980]   Oh, there is nothing more tragic about the modern world than the very prostitution of
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.020]   the mind and of the intellect.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.540]   But men should give this great faculty with which God has endowed us for something so
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.940]   small, so petty, and so unworthy.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.580]   Man's mind has not been allowed to develop and to expand and to be what God means it
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.580]   to be.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.780]   It is seen mentally.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:41.740]   But you see exactly the same thing morally, don't you?
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.820]   Man was made in the image of God, and God is holy.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.460]   And man was made perfect.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.260]   But look at him.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:56.460]   Look at the failure of men to develop morally, to see holiness and to like it and to enjoy
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.820]   it and to desire it and to practice it.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.060]   Look at the moral state of men and women.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.860]   Man I say is not an animal.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.780]   He was not meant to live like a beast.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.980]   He was not meant to live simply to gratify his own desires and lusts and passions.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.180]   That is what the animal does, of course.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.140]   The animal is governed by these things that are within him.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   He is a creature that lives according to his own instincts.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.460]   The instinct pulls the trigger and he responds.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.420]   And you don't blame an animal for doing that.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.780]   An animal is an animal.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.280]   But a man is meant to be a man.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.180]   But look at men morally.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.020]   He doesn't grow, he doesn't develop.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.620]   In spite of teaching and exhortation and knowledge and culture, look at his life.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.380]   Man today is living like a beast.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.620]   He is living just to obey his passions and lusts and desires.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.820]   He will trample upon all the sanctities.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.500]   He doesn't care how much somebody else has got to suffer, as long as he gets what he
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   wants.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.060]   That is the animal.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:59.620]   Man is undeveloped and underdeveloped morally as well as mentally.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.260]   And indeed the same thing is true of him emotionally.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   Emotion is a great and a grand and a noble thing.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:16.780]   But people's idea of emotion today is sloppy sentimentality.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   Sex in some shape or form and nothing more.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.140]   That is their conception of emotion.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:28.940]   This grand and glorious thing that you see flowering in the Son of God, our Lord and
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.140]   Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.220]   Our grand emotional nature is not developed, it is not expanded.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.300]   We are not able to throw the things as we are meant to be.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.380]   Do you enjoy the sunshine?
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.740]   Do you enjoy the stars and the moon and the rivers and the flowers and the animals?
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.820]   Do they make you praise God?
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.700]   Can you say to me, "The meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that often lie
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.780]   too deep for tears"?
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.060]   What of your emotional nature?
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.980]   How true is our picture?
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.380]   Man as the result of sin is indeed like the shrub in the desert.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.020]   He is not developed, he is stunted.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.860]   He has not become what he is meant to be.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.900]   Indeed I could work this out in every direction.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.180]   I could point out to you that man is not developed as he is meant to be in body or in mind or
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.580]   in spirit.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.580]   I include the body, you notice.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.860]   Man as God made him was not subject to disease.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.140]   His body was perfect.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.100]   You see there is a great harmony in everything that God makes.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.180]   There is a balance and a proportion.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.380]   And man is body, mind and spirit.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.620]   And they are all meant to be perfect, but they are not, are they?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.140]   Our very bodies are weak and subject to disease.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.380]   All that came in with sin and our bodies are unworthy.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.020]   They are shapeless, formless, we are ugly.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:02.740]   The body of man is not what it is meant to be and not what it can be and will be in the
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:08.700]   case of those who trust in Christ and who can look forward to a glorified body, even
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.060]   like the glorified body of the Son of God himself.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.900]   Even physically, bodily, we are not what we are meant to be.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:20.800]   We are like a shrub, a heath in the desert.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.620]   And it is true, I say, not only of the body but of the mind and of the spirit.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.340]   Man was made for God.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.100]   He was meant for God.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.340]   God said, "Let us make men in our own image."
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.940]   And he made men in his own image.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:45.220]   And man was there communing with God, enjoying the fellowship, his spirit, communing with
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   God's spirit.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.900]   And that was paradise.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.580]   That was bliss.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.460]   Is that true of men today?
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.580]   Can you find God when you seek him?
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.540]   Are you enjoying fellowship and communion with him?
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:06.740]   Is your spirit, I say, in this communion with God and in correspondence with him?
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.660]   No, no.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:14.060]   Man, as we are told, is like a shrub in the desert.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   And there is something unattractive about it all.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.380]   Have you seen yourself like this, my friend?
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.540]   That is the truth about us all by nature and because of this soil out of which our life
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.620]   comes.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.620]   But let me hurry on to the next thing which we are told is this, and it obviously follows
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.180]   by a logical necessity.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.540]   Because of all this, of course, man does not bear any fruit.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.540]   His life is useless.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.980]   Now I will tell you something very interesting about this shrub.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   According to Pliny, a great authority, this shrub was excluded from religious uses because
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.800]   it had neither fruit nor seed.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.140]   And he goes on to say that it is neither sown nor planted.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.020]   Now that is a horticultural fact.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.500]   And obviously the prophet knew that and he uses this comparison.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.620]   The terrible thing about the ungodly life finally is that it is a life that is valueless.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.620]   It is useless.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.620]   It does not bear any fruit.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.380]   It is not productive.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:23.900]   I could give you endless similar statements in the scripture bearing out that very fact.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.980]   Take the one I read at the beginning tonight in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.820]   Galatians.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:33.780]   You notice the contrast that Paul draws there between the works of the flesh and the fruit
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.220]   of the spirit.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.700]   The flesh cannot produce fruit.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.300]   It can only work.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.100]   And its works are perishing.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.500]   And they have no life in them.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.180]   And they are dead works, as another scripture puts it.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:55.220]   So here as we look at this picture we have a contrast in our minds between the works
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.220]   of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.220]   You noticed the list, didn't you?
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:08.740]   The works of the flesh are these, fornication, adultery, blasphemy, jealousy, envy, drunkenness,
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:14.820]   revelings, banqueting, robberies.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.700]   Is there anything less productive?
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.820]   Is there any value in that sort of thing?
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.500]   Does it make any contribution at all to life, to anybody anywhere?
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.980]   That is the tragedy of this godless life.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.020]   It is like that shrub in the desert that never produces any seed, nor any fruit at all.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.260]   It is absolutely useless in every respect.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.660]   So is this ungodly life.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:46.700]   It does not give any fruit to the poor person himself or herself.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:52.540]   The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.660]   Does the worldly life give you that?
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.380]   Have you got love in your heart?
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.260]   Is there joy in your heart?
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.020]   Are you rarely enjoying peace?
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.860]   I am asking my question to those who do not believe in regeneration and the rebirth, and
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.140]   who say they do not understand this gospel with Christ dying for our sins and so on.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.660]   They believe that as long as a man puts his back into it and his mind into it, he can
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.660]   do it.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:23.980]   Well, I am just asking you, are you enjoying a great sense of love in your heart?
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:30.740]   Is there great peace within you that nothing can disturb?
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:36.820]   And are you full of joy, unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.140]   Of course not.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.940]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.540]   There is no peace, saith my God to the wicked.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.580]   The life without God is always finally a joyless life.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.940]   You try to make yourself happy by buying things, drink other things, and as long as you have
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   money, you can make yourself fairly happy.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.260]   But then the day comes when, like the prodigal, you have got no money left.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.260]   You have spent all your money.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.820]   Your pockets are empty and nobody wants you and nobody gives you anything.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:09.180]   And you are alone with a swine and the husks in the far country, miserable, wretched, down
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.300]   and out and broken.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   There is no fruit for the person himself in this sort of life.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.100]   And he is of no help to others.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.140]   He is so self-centered and so intent upon the gratification of his own desires.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.620]   He knows nothing about longsuffering and gentleness and goodness.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.500]   You see, the world is the hell it is tonight because of that.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   Why do people quarrel?
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   Why do they separate?
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.340]   Why is there all this breakdown in married life and in other respects?
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.740]   Why are little children suffering?
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.740]   What is the matter?
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:49.100]   It is because there is no longsuffering, which is a fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.400]   We do not bear with one another.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.220]   We blame one another.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.500]   We say, "I am all right, it is this other person."
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   And it is always the other.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   There is no longsuffering.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.580]   There is no fruit for the other person.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:08.260]   And no gentleness, no tenderness, no desire to see the other's point of view and to
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.780]   bear with the other's weakness and to try to help the other.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.260]   No goodness, no good nature.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:20.980]   These are the things that are absent and are less becoming increasingly absent in the life
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.780]   of today as men and women forget God more and more.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.500]   Have you not noticed that life is becoming more coarse?
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.940]   There is less politeness even in life.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.900]   A sort of gruffness has come in.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.220]   We do not thank people like we used to.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.100]   You see, it is affecting the whole of life.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.100]   And it always happens.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:44.860]   There is no fruit at all, either for the person himself or for anybody else.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:56.420]   The godless life makes no contribution whatsoever to life in any respect.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.180]   It has nothing in itself to fall back upon.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.900]   It has nothing to give another.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.780]   The Apostle Paul puts this in a famous question.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.380]   He is writing to Christian people and he asks them to look back across their lives before
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.100]   they became Christians when they lived a life of sin.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.860]   And this is his question.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:22.020]   What fruit had he then in those things of which he is now ashamed?
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.180]   You had no fruit in them then.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.140]   The godless life rarely does not satisfy, does it?
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   It is a passing pleasure and it is gone.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.980]   It is followed by remorse and you try and forget that by going back to have more.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.380]   It has nothing lasting.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   It does not build you up.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.880]   It does not give you anything.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.340]   And it does not enable you to give anybody else anything.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:47.140]   Well, let me put it by contrast in this way.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.020]   Life without God and without Christ ends as it began.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.940]   There is no real growth in it.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.940]   There is no benefit.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.820]   There is no value.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.420]   And it has got nothing to contribute to life.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.900]   Whereas the greatest benefactors of the world as ever known have been the saints.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.820]   You read the history.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:12.580]   You go back in this welfare state and ask where did hospitals first come from?
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   Whoever thought of them and why did they think of them?
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.740]   Where have our educational systems come from?
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.220]   Our poor law and all the rest of it.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.220]   Where did it begin?
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.260]   Who were the first to consider the troubles and the problems and the trials and the sufferings
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   of mankind?
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.260]   Who were they?
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.740]   And the answer every time is this.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:36.340]   Christian people without exception.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:49.060]   The godless life is a profitless, fruitless, useless, wasteful life.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.580]   The last thing I find here about it is this.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.580]   And did you notice it?
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.780]   It is the most extraordinary thing and most significant.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.260]   He shall be like the heath in the desert.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.460]   Listen to this.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:09.180]   Man shall not see when good cometh.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:15.780]   That is the tragedy of all tragedies, that.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:23.460]   Because of the soil, because of its nature, because of where it is, it cannot even benefit
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.140]   from good.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:30.660]   It shall not see even when good cometh.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.180]   Look at it like this.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.100]   Look at that shrub there in the desert, in that salt land and not inhabited.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:43.540]   There is a wonderful shower of rain and then there is glorious sunshine.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.620]   The shrub does not derive any benefit from it at all.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.620]   It cannot, you see.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.060]   There is no root there.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.220]   There is no depth there.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.320]   There is nothing there to respond to it.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.340]   So that though you may get the sun and the rain and everything else, the shrub remains
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.620]   the shrub.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:05.100]   It does not see when good comes, even it is so terrible in its condition that it cannot
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.740]   enjoy the benefits that come to it.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:16.340]   I know nothing which is so sad, so tragic about the sinful, the godless life as just
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.340]   that.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:23.620]   It is a life which, because it is what it is and because it is growing from the soil
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:31.460]   from which it grows, because it lacks this root, is a life that cannot enjoy even God's
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.780]   benefits.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.060]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:42.620]   God is so gracious and good and loving and kind that he causeth his Son to rise on the
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:48.580]   evil end on the good and sendeth his rain on the just and the unjust.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.980]   God in his providence blesses ungodly people in this life and world.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.860]   He gives them the gift of life.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.500]   He gives them their families and loved ones.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.340]   He gives them health and strength.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.460]   Every one of these things comes to you from God, my friend, every one of them.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.620]   He gives you food and clothing because if he did not send the sun and the rain, you
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.100]   would not have food.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.900]   God could stop it all by just withholding his blessings.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:18.580]   Everything you enjoy in life is a gift of God.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.200]   And yet the tragedy of the man who lives in sin and who does not know God is that he gets
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.180]   no ultimate fundamental benefit from it.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.500]   He does not appreciate it.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.940]   He does not know what is happening.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.660]   He does not really derive benefit from God's daily gifts and benefits.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.180]   But let me hurry on to something beyond God's providence.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:42.860]   Is not this a terrible thing that here is this book, this Word of God in the world before
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:48.980]   men's eyes, and they get nothing from it?
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.180]   He shall not see when good cometh.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.660]   They have got Bibles in their homes, but they never read them.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.100]   Some of them have got big Bibles like this, and what do they use them for?
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.260]   To put flower pots on.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.540]   They never open them.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.660]   They do not get any good, no benefit from them.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.900]   Here is this rich teaching that relishes the heart of a Christian, that gives him knowledge
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:16.780]   and understanding, and that thrills him with its extraordinary sweep of mind and of outlook.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.660]   And you put it in front of a man who has not got a new nature and who does not know Christ,
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.420]   and he says, "I see nothing in it.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   There is nothing there.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.980]   It is unutterably boring."
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.940]   God's Word to him gives him nothing.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.660]   Shall not see when good cometh.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:39.140]   Don't you see now the need of the rebirth and of a new nature, a new soil, a new beginning?
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.700]   But wait a minute.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.700]   Think of this.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:48.980]   The trouble with this shrub is that it shall not see when good cometh.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:56.060]   And the final tragedy of the man who does not trust God, the man of the world who trusts
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:05.020]   himself, is that he derives no benefit at all from the greatest thing that even God
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.340]   has done.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:14.980]   The fact is, my friend, that God so loved the world that he gave, he has given, he has
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:20.820]   sent his only begotten Son into it.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:28.140]   He sent his Son into this world to bless men, to save them, to deliver them from this sinful
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:34.540]   condition, to give them pardon, to make them his children, to bless them with joys beyond
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   our imagination.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:41.980]   The Son of God, Jesus Christ, has been into this world and he has even gone to the cross
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.980]   on Calvary.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.660]   He has suffered it all.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.700]   He has gone down into the grave and has risen again in order that you and I might become
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:58.500]   princes and children of God and enjoy eternal bliss.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.580]   But there are masses of people who see nothing in it.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.580]   See?
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:07.020]   No, you don't even see when good cometh.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.220]   Can read about Christ and hear about him.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.860]   Say, "I see nothing in it."
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.340]   They see nothing in it.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.340]   Why is this?
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.740]   Well, it's because of the nature, I say again.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.300]   It's because of that soil.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.660]   You can send the sun and the rain and all the benefits.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:29.580]   They remain shrubs and they will remain shrubs until something drastic is done to them.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:35.000]   Do you see the meaning of Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.540]   Do you see the vital importance of the coming of the Son of God into this world?
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.220]   Do you know what he was doing on that cross?
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.700]   Do you know it, my friend?
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.080]   Have you seen the benefit?
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.020]   Have you seen this love so amazing, so divine?
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.260]   Have you surveyed the wondrous cross?
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.260]   Have you seen its message?
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   Does it thrill you?
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.580]   Do you say it's the most marvelous thing of all?
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:03.020]   If you don't, you know there's only one thing to say about you.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.220]   You are like that shrub in the desert.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.300]   Your whole nature is wrong.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.660]   It's hopeless.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.700]   And there's only one end to such a life.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:20.900]   It is, of course, that it shrivels, it dries up eventually.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:25.220]   It's been no good while it's been there.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:35.700]   And it just shrivels up and dies under the curse.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:40.140]   Our time is gone.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:48.820]   But I have deliberately kept you face to face with this first picture this evening.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:55.360]   It is only when men and women see themselves like that, that they begin to see the need
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:02.860]   of a Savior, that they begin to see why it was absolutely essential that the Son of God
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:09.100]   should come from heaven to earth, that education and culture and knowledge and will and self-effort
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:14.300]   can never do it, that there's only one hope for men, and that is that he be given a new
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:22.420]   life and a new nature, a new start and a new beginning.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.980]   And that is the message of the Christian faith.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:35.860]   But in spite of our being what we are, God has had mercy upon us.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:40.740]   He has sent his Son to bear our sins and their punishment in order that he might forgive
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.740]   us.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:42.740]   We need forgiveness.
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.740]   We are a disgrace to God.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.580]   We are an insult to God.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.180]   We have been made by him to be like that.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.700]   That is sin.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.740]   We need forgiveness.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.740]   We need pardon.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.100]   This has got to be cleansed out of us.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.860]   And God has provided the way to do it.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.340]   He sent his Son to die for our sins.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.180]   It's the only hope for us.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:12.260]   Nothing else can do it, because we are dead.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.520]   And then he gives us the new nature.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:25.180]   He takes us and he plants us in himself.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:29.560]   We begin to draw of his life and of his power.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:34.860]   We become like branches in a vine.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.820]   We begin to bear fruit.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:45.700]   We are blessed ourselves and we become a blessing unto others.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:53.460]   My dear friend, have you been born again?
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.300]   You can easily answer the question by just looking at yourself in terms of the picture
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.060]   that I have held before you.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:11.180]   Are you enjoying the benefits, the blessings of God's gospel in Christ?
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.460]   Have you seen the good that has come?
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.340]   Are you bearing fruit?
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:25.100]   If not, you are still in the desert, in the salt land and not inhabited.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.340]   And if so, turn to him without a moment's hesitation.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.340]   Confess it to him.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   Acknowledge it.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:36.100]   Tell him that you see that all your pride was nonsense and all your boasting was idle.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.860]   Tell him that you see you are like the shrub in the desert.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.580]   Ask him to forgive you and to pardon you.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:48.500]   Believe him when he tells you that he does so in Christ and in him crucified.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:53:00.140]   And ask him to give you this new life, this new heart, this implanting into Christ that
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.220]   will make you a new man.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.780]   You ask him and he will do so.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:15.380]   And the picture will be entirely reversed and will become like the tree.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:22.380]   And God willing, I hope to describe that to you in detail next Sunday night.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.940]   But it is possible now.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.900]   You need not wait.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:35.140]   Live the life and then that will become true of you.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.940]   Amen.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
