[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.360]   Today, we are talking about goal setting
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   and achieving goals.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.600]   Now, we've done three full episodes
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.120]   about this topic previously.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.360]   I did a solo episode about this topic
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.240]   where I described the neuroscience of the circuitry
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.080]   in the brain and body
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   that underlies goal setting and pursuit.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   I also hosted two expert guests
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.560]   who have done extensive research on these topics.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.280]   Those guests were Dr. Emily Balchetes
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.520]   from New York University and Dr. Maya Shankar.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.840]   So today's episode is going to focus on the key takeaways
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.280]   from those three previous episodes,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.020]   as well as incorporate new information
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.600]   that has been published in the scientific literature
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.560]   since those episodes aired,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.720]   so that by the end of today's episode,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   you will have a potent toolkit
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.060]   for setting and pursuing goals.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.260]   We will talk about how to select
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.400]   which goals to pursue and when.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.240]   We will talk about how to measure your progress.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.440]   We will talk about how to initiate and sustain motivation
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.800]   as you pursue your goals.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.620]   We are also going to dispel some prominent myths
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.400]   about goal setting and pursuit.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.680]   Given that this is a toolkit episode,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.520]   I will talk about some of the underlying
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   biological mechanisms for the protocols that I describe,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.800]   but most of what I will cover are the protocols themselves,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   the how to identify a goal,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.220]   select the best goal for you to pursue,
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.880]   how to initiate goal pursuit,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.520]   how to maintain goal pursuit,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   how to evaluate progress,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.800]   and how to do the post hoc analysis after you achieve a goal
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.900]   or as the case may be, not achieve a goal.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.960]   Although I am confident that if you implement
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.660]   even a subset of the protocols that we cover today,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.160]   that you stand the greatest possible chance
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.460]   of both setting the proper goal
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340]   and achieving that goal.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.160]   And I can say that both with confidence and humility
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.800]   because the protocols I describe were not created by me.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.780]   They are gleaned from the scientific peer reviewed literature
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.020]   and they have been shown to work.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.700]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.360]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.580]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.240]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.820]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.900]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.620]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.640]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.320]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.340]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.600]   Sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.920]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.760]   When we're sleeping well and enough,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.740]   everything in life goes much better.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.640]   And when we aren't sleeping well or long enough,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.880]   things in life get worse.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.100]   We know that from data,
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.660]   we all know that from our own experience.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.060]   One of the essential things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.920]   is that the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.220]   needs to be such that your core body temperature
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.000]   drops by about one to three degrees
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.220]   in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220]   and then increase by one to three degrees
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.860]   in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.460]   With Eight Sleep smart mattress covers,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.080]   you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.700]   so that it's ideally matched to your temperature needs.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.640]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.540]   a few years ago,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.740]   and it has completely transformed the quality
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.860]   of the sleep that I get.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.460]   So much so that I actually loathe traveling
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.380]   because I don't have my Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.220]   when I travel.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.460]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.120]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.660]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.120]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.020]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.780]   I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.820]   and with guests about the need to get approximately one gram
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.460]   of high quality protein per pound of body weight each day
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.100]   for optimal nutrition.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.340]   There are many different ways that one can do that,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.000]   but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280]   by ingesting excessive calories.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520]   Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.660]   of quality protein per calorie,
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.100]   and it achieves that in delicious things
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.500]   like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.380]   I particularly like the ground venison.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.660]   I make those into venison burgers
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.820]   probably five times a week or more.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.220]   I also like the jerky for its convenience,
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.320]   especially when I'm traveling
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140]   or I'm especially busy with work
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.680]   and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient dense
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.300]   high quality source of protein.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.420]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.820]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.060]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.060]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.540]   Okay, let's talk about goal setting and pursuit.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.860]   And as I mentioned a few minutes ago,
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.020]   this is a toolkit episode.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.480]   So I'm not going to talk too much
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.420]   about the mechanistic underpinnings of the protocols
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.600]   for goal setting and pursuit.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.480]   I'm mostly just going to give you those protocols.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.660]   But before I do that, I want to take just three minutes,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.820]   I promise just three minutes or less,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.340]   and describe the neural circuitry involved
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.780]   in goal setting and pursuit.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.020]   And there are two reasons to do that.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.640]   First of all, the biology of goal setting and pursuit
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.740]   is absolutely beautiful.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.820]   It's incredible that we and many other animals, in fact,
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.620]   have this neural circuitry
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.660]   and that it works in the way that it does.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.280]   But equally important is that when we have
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.620]   a mechanistic understanding or framework
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.220]   for how a protocol or set of protocols work,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.940]   it makes it much easier to tweak those protocols
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.860]   and customize them to our unique needs.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.620]   Okay, so with that said,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.540]   the goal setting and pursuit circuitry
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.020]   essentially consists of four major stations in the brain.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.060]   Although it's important to point out
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.420]   that each of those stations
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.180]   has a number of other connections that are important
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.460]   for the whole goal setting and pursuit process.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.960]   But we can distill things down to four major hubs
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.940]   or stations within the brain.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.720]   And those are the basal ganglia,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.380]   the lateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.720]   and the orbital frontal cortex.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.780]   So going through those one by one,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.480]   the amygdala is a structure within the brain,
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.320]   you actually have two of them,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.860]   one on each side of the brain,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.780]   that is involved in circuits associated with arousal
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.900]   in driving levels of alertness.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.020]   It's also involved in fear,
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.400]   you've probably heard that many times before,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.900]   but also things like anxiety.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.680]   And actually the amygdala can be involved
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.740]   in what we call positive valence experiences,
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.800]   not just the bad stuff like fear and anxiety,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.320]   but also positive forms of arousal and even learning.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.560]   The basal ganglia include a lot
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.100]   of different brain structures,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.580]   but for sake of today's discussion,
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.740]   what you need to know is that the basal ganglia
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.500]   includes two major pathways.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.300]   One is the so-called go pathway,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.860]   which is the pathway involved in generating actions.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.200]   And the other is the so-called no-go pathway,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.780]   or the pathway involved in withholding or ceasing action.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.300]   And this is really important to understand
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.520]   because with all goals, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.040]   are we trying to learn how to do something new,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.820]   or are we trying to withhold a certain set of actions?
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.100]   And of course, anytime we learn anything,
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.640]   it's a process of both generating
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.840]   and withholding certain actions.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.260]   So we've got the amygdala and we have the basal ganglia,
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.100]   which has this go action initiating
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.980]   and no-go action withholding circuitry within it.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.140]   And then there's the lateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.500]   which is involved in immediate and long-term planning.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.120]   And this is going to be a key component
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.380]   of today's discussion because we aren't going to be talking
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.320]   about lateral prefrontal cortex per se,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.560]   but we are going to be talking about time perception
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.900]   in the context of setting and achieving our goals,
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.180]   because setting and achieving our goals
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.240]   is all about being able to orient both in space,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.500]   knowing where we are and what we're doing,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.060]   but also in time, know where we are in that road of progress
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.500]   toward achieving our goal or crossing that finish line
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.620]   and repeatedly updating those finish lines in many cases.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.460]   And the fourth structure is the orbital frontal cortex,
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.460]   which like all brain areas tends to be a multitasker,
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.060]   does a bunch of different things.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.380]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.460]   it's important to understand
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.660]   that the orbital frontal cortex is involved in evaluation
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.840]   of our current emotional state and arousal state
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.460]   as it relates to our goal pursuit.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.580]   For instance, are we happy because we are sensing progress
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.460]   or are we unhappy and feeling frustrated or sad or angry
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.200]   because we are feeling that we are not achieving progress
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.000]   or that somehow we can't get into the sorts of actions
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.100]   that are going to allow us to eventually reach our goals?
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.420]   Okay, so I described four major structures,
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.860]   all of which communicate with each other
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.340]   and of course, a lot of other brain areas.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.660]   And those four structures were the amygdala,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.460]   the basal ganglia, the go and no-go circuitry,
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.960]   the lateral prefrontal cortex
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.340]   and the orbital frontal cortex.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.680]   And those represent the core components
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.540]   of the neural circuitry involved in goal setting and pursuit.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.180]   Now I realized I didn't time that section,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.780]   so I don't know whether or not it was three minutes or less,
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.520]   but if it was shorter than three minutes, great.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.260]   And if it was longer than three minutes,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.140]   well, I promised to shave a couple of minutes
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.660]   off the end of this episode.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.060]   Okay, so now you have the understanding
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.680]   that we all have the same neural circuitry
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.980]   for goal setting and pursuit.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.080]   I find that amazing regardless of whether or not
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.820]   you want to achieve a fitness goal or an academic goal
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.280]   or a work goal, monetary goal, relationship goal,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.460]   maybe you want to just get better at relaxing.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.140]   I've been told I should perhaps pursue that goal.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.500]   Well, you're going to use the same neural circuits
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.680]   for each and any of those.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.900]   I find that incredible.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.460]   I also find that very reassuring because what it means
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.820]   is that if we can focus on the tools and protocols
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.640]   that are anchored in the biology of goal setting and pursuit
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.440]   as we understand them to exist in all humans
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.620]   and indeed in other animals as well,
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.180]   well, then we should have the greatest possible confidence
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.380]   that we will in fact achieve our goals.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.860]   So how do we go about doing that?
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   Well, the first question you need to ask yourself
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.640]   is what goal do I want to pursue?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.460]   And the first protocol for deciding what goal
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.220]   you want to pursue is actually a quite simple one
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.720]   in terms of how it's stated,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.900]   but it's fairly complex for a lot of people to answer.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.240]   And that is which specific goal
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.060]   are you going to try and pursue?
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.340]   Because guess what, folks?
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.220]   Most people who trying to achieve many goals simultaneously
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.200]   fail at all of them.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.420]   This is what I call the overhaul approach
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.280]   when people think, okay, you know, on January 1
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.300]   or next month or next week, or perhaps even today,
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.500]   I'm going to start exercising, I'm going to start meditating,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.780]   I'm going to learn a language, I'm going to learn to dance,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.020]   I'm going to do all these different things.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.940]   And that's just too many goals.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.900]   I think here is an appropriate place
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.500]   to highlight the word priority.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.300]   A priority literally means one thing
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.980]   that you place ahead of all others.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.940]   These days we hear a lot about priorities, plural,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.760]   but we really should be thinking about priority
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.620]   and defining our priority for learning in a given phase.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.380]   So if you are somebody who wants to get more physically fit
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.680]   or you want to learn something cognitively, that's terrific.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.640]   You are allowed to have multiple goals,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   but I highly recommend that you first select just one goal.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.840]   Of course, you don't let go of other aspects
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.540]   of your mental health and physical health,
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.060]   that you don't throw your life away
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.500]   in service to this one goal.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.700]   We've all seen how that goes and it's not a pretty picture,
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.300]   but rather that you continue to engage in healthy ways
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.980]   with the other aspects of your life
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.640]   that you're proficient at or mostly proficient at,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.980]   but that you select one goal
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.740]   that you're going to try and attain.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.700]   How you select that one goal, of course,
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.160]   is going to reflect your values,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.980]   your motivation, your resources,
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.420]   but it's very important that you spend some serious time
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.340]   defining that one priority, that one goal
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.620]   for this initial goal setting and pursuit period.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.980]   And in a moment, I'll tell you how long that goal
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.820]   pursuit period ought to be.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.500]   But for some people, the best way to define
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.340]   which goal they're going to pursue
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.300]   is to write out the different things that they want
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.200]   and then essentially cross off the various things
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   that they're willing to put on hold for the time being
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.300]   and circle the thing that they're really going to focus on
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.880]   and only that thing.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   And again, this is highly individual.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.320]   It's going to depend on you, your past, your present,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.860]   your future, your resources, all of that.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.920]   But having that one priority
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.680]   is going to really increase the probability
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.700]   that you're going to achieve your goal.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.960]   Now, we also know from the scientific literature
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.940]   that how lofty that goal is will impact
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.060]   whether or not you're able to achieve it.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.960]   And I think most people mistakenly believe
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.820]   that if a goal is easy to achieve,
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.720]   it's more likely that they will achieve that goal,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.860]   sort of a duh.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.120]   But in fact, the opposite has been shown to be true.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.840]   If a goal is too easy to achieve,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.440]   it seems that it doesn't recruit sufficient amounts
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.160]   of the arousal network that involves the amygdala,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.600]   but a bunch of other brain structures as well
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.900]   that get people into the necessary actions
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.980]   to continually pursue that goal.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.160]   This perhaps should not be surprising.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.840]   In order to learn something,
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.880]   we have to shift our nervous system into states
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.660]   that are somewhat uncomfortable.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.080]   They should be safely uncomfortable states,
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.840]   but they should be uncomfortable states.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.120]   And we're going to talk more about this
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.700]   as the episode continues,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.220]   but any kind of successful learning or goal pursuit
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.800]   is going to involve errors.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.440]   It's going to involve failures.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.880]   It's going to involve frustration.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.120]   It's going to involve anxiety.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.520]   All of those states of mind and body, in fact,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.240]   shift the brain into modes of so-called neuroplasticity.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.360]   They give it the ability to change.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.920]   And that should make perfect sense
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.640]   because if you can complete what you need to do easily,
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.360]   there's absolutely no reason for the neural circuitry
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.620]   in your brain or body to shift in any way.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.760]   Why would it?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.300]   Rather, those states of discomfort, frustration,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.660]   anxiety, et cetera,
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.200]   represent shifts in neurochemical states
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.880]   that literally open the opportunity
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.340]   for neuroplasticity to occur.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.740]   The changes between neurons that allow those neurons
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.940]   and their associated neural circuits
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.080]   to perform differently in the future
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.540]   when we learn something.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.020]   So the key here is twofold.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.420]   First, define the specific priority goal
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.700]   that you're going to pursue
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.860]   and set aside all other goal pursuits.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.060]   And in doing that,
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.480]   it makes sense to pursue a somewhat loftier goal
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.540]   than perhaps a more mundane goal.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.840]   Or if you know exactly what goal you're going to prioritize,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.580]   that you try and achieve perhaps more
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.960]   than you think you ought to be able to achieve
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   within that given goal.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   And within the goal that you decide to prioritize,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.840]   you want to set a level of progress,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.520]   a level of performance that you're striving to attain
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.080]   that's a bit above what you actually believe
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.800]   at this time you can accomplish.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.440]   Now, in doing so, you are inevitably going to encounter
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.320]   some frustration and anxiety,
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.280]   but remember the component of the neural circuitry
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.440]   that we talked about at the beginning of the episode,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.080]   the orbital frontal cortex.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.600]   That orbital frontal cortex
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.200]   is not just part of a neural circuitry
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.580]   that assesses how we feel in a given moment
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.640]   as we are trying to pursue a goal,
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.480]   but it also understands context.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.520]   It has the capacity to, for instance,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.800]   see that you are experiencing anxiety,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.680]   know that you are frustrated,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   but now that you understand that anxiety and frustration
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.880]   that comes with making errors is actually the gateway,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.200]   it's a necessary gateway
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.000]   to achieving neural circuit changes,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.840]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.920]   Well, the orbital frontal cortex understands that context.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.720]   It literally can take information about neuroplasticity,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.040]   it can take information about frustration,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.380]   which you now have, and it can combine those
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.660]   such that when you experience that frustration,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.100]   you experience those errors
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.380]   and you previously would have wanted to quit,
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.020]   now you know that you are literally making progress.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.180]   You're literally shifting those neural circuits
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.040]   in the direction of improved learning.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.140]   Now, it's also important to remind that neuroplasticity,
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.460]   the changes in neural circuits
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.140]   that allow for improved performance in the future
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.500]   does not occur instantaneously.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.100]   That frustration that occurs during our attempts to learn
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.780]   or to pursue a goal is the trigger for neuroplasticity,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.660]   the actual rewiring of neural circuits
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.860]   that allows for proficient, correct performance
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.400]   occurs during deep sleep and other forms of deep rest.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.000]   This is something I've covered extensively
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.340]   in episodes on neuroplasticity and learning,
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.220]   and if you'd like to learn more about neuroplasticity,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.660]   in fact, if you'd like a zero-cost toolkit
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.780]   that defines the so-called super protocol
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.860]   for neuroplasticity and learning
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.540]   that is not just nested
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.220]   within the context of goal pursuit and learning,
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.300]   we have that, you can go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.680]   you go to the menu, you scroll down to newsletter,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.780]   and you can sign up, it's completely zero cost,
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   and you'll get that as a brief,
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.280]   I believe it's a two or maybe three page PDF.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.980]   Okay, so returning to goal setting and pursuit,
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.460]   first, you need to set your goal.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.660]   You really should take the time required
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.340]   to define your priority.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.840]   What are you going to try and learn?
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.660]   And then you're going to pick a goal
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.300]   that really feels challenging,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.840]   that feels like it might even be out of reach,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.700]   because that will recruit the neural circuits
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.140]   associated with arousal,
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.960]   they're motivating enough to get you into action.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.000]   Now, I want to be very clear,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.820]   I'm not suggesting that you pick a goal
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.080]   that's impossible to achieve
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.680]   or that you believe is impossible to achieve,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.220]   that's not going to serve you well.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.840]   Rather, I'm saying pick a goal
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.780]   that feels just a bit out of reach,
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.760]   and don't obsess too much about whether or not
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.200]   it's a lot out of reach or a little bit out of reach,
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.760]   pick something you're excited to pursue
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.940]   that you would really like to accomplish,
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.400]   set that goal, and then just set aside all other goals.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.760]   Still, of course, maintain or improve
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.960]   other aspects of your life that are necessary
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.340]   for daily living, for mental health,
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.840]   physical health, et cetera,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.800]   but really just focus on one goal.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.340]   I promise that you will be far more satisfied
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.800]   with the results if you can truly set a priority.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.620]   So once you've defined the specific goal
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.500]   that you are going to prioritize,
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.860]   there are two more things that you need to do
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.100]   before you start to pursue that goal.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.660]   The first one is that you need to define the specific verbs,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.940]   the actions that are involved in pursuing that goal.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.260]   This is absolutely critical.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.780]   A lot of people will set a sort of title goal
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.280]   or a goal state.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.680]   They'll say, "Oh, you know, I want to be rich,"
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   or, "I want to be smart,"
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.380]   or they will say, "I want to be fit or proficient
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.800]   in a given language."
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.600]   It's really important that you put additional specificity
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.440]   on your goal.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.160]   In fact, it's important that you put a lot of specificity
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.280]   on your goal and that you focus mainly on verbs
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.480]   when defining that specificity.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.880]   Now, there are a lot of reasons for this
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.080]   that have to do both with increasing the probability
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.760]   that you will achieve your goal,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.000]   as well as maintaining motivation as you pursue that goal.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.080]   So for instance, rather than saying you want to be fit
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.860]   or you want to be a better runner or swimmer,
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.260]   you would want to get very specific about the verb
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.360]   that you're going to engage in in order to achieve that goal.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.680]   Now, it's somewhat obvious in the case of running
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.520]   or swimming.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.600]   I think everyone understands
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.200]   that if you want to be a better runner,
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.800]   there is going to be some running involved.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.880]   If you want to be a better swimmer,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.600]   there's going to be some swimming involved, of course,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.260]   but presumably there'll be some other behaviors as well,
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.940]   everything from driving to the pool or lacing up your shoes.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.520]   I mean, there's an essentially near infinite number
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.200]   of verbs involved in any type of goal pursuit.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.160]   So what we are talking about here
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.920]   is really defining the goal on a piece of paper,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.960]   and I do think that's important.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.400]   You should write this down.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.220]   And I think the process of selecting your goal,
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.160]   that priority, as well as defining the specificity
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.500]   of the verb action that you're going to pursue
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.660]   should be done on paper.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.560]   You of course are going to think,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.600]   but then you should write it out.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.140]   Seeing things on paper and writing them out by hand
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.840]   with pen or pencil really has been shown
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.480]   to engage neural circuitry in a way that is different
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.120]   than typing with your thumbs into your phone,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.640]   which by the way is a new feature of human evolution.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.480]   I do believe this is the first time in human evolution
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.900]   that we have written with our thumbs.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.360]   I don't know, I don't have a time machine.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.280]   I can't go back and check,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.880]   but I'm willing to place a bet
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.020]   that that statement is correct.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.800]   So the point is that writing things out
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.760]   is not only important,
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.020]   it's also the most effective way to embed knowledge
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.620]   in our nervous system.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.540]   And so I highly recommend that you write things out
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.800]   on a piece of paper in your process of goal setting.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.940]   So when we are talking about generating verb specificity
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.300]   about your goal, it would look like the following.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.540]   So let's say I want to quote, unquote, get more fit
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.280]   or learn conversational French
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.960]   or anything for that matter, gardening.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.240]   Maybe I want to build a gazebo in the backyard
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.220]   or a deck in the backyard.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.000]   The key thing to answer is what is the major block of action
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   that's going to be involved in pursuing that goal?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.760]   So for instance, if you want to get more fit
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.120]   and you're going to do that primarily
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.440]   through running and weight training
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.840]   or swimming and weight training,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.360]   you would want to get very specific
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.000]   in defining that priority goal
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.740]   as I'm going to run X number of miles per week
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.540]   or I'm going to go to the gym three times per week
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.380]   to lift weights.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.580]   Although I would recommend
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.860]   getting even more specific than that.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.060]   I would recommend that you literally write down,
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.740]   I'm going to go to the gym three times per week
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.040]   for a minimum of 60 minutes where 50 minutes of that
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.740]   are carrying out hard work, okay?
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.660]   With of course rest between sets, et cetera.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.360]   Or I'm going to attend three classes per week
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.940]   or perhaps even just one class per week
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.640]   of learning conversational French.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.060]   Plus I'm going to spend two hours per week
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.280]   of practicing say word problems or mathematical problems.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Whatever it is, you want to define first the priority,
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.000]   then you want to define the verb action
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.040]   that represents the bulk of effort towards that priority.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.300]   So running in the case of the person
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.740]   who wants to get fit by running, weightlifting,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.460]   in the case of the person that wants to get fit
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.220]   by weightlifting, though of course I highly recommend
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.660]   people do both resistance training
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.520]   and cardiovascular training
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.580]   if indeed they want to be truly fit.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.160]   Or in the case of language learning
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.860]   or learning how to code or gardening
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.980]   or something of that sort,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.340]   to really define the verb actions involved
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.740]   and then to place specificity in terms of the amount of time
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.820]   that one is going to try to achieve each week
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.540]   in pursuit of that specific priority goal.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.340]   Now I realize that that process itself
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.540]   takes a bit of time,
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.180]   but when you look back on the 100 year plus
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.620]   scientific literature of what leads to successful
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.420]   goal setting and pursuit,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.280]   you find over and over again
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.100]   that those two components we've been talking about,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.660]   specificity and measurability are paramount.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.420]   You just simply cannot discard those from the process
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.460]   if you expect yourself to achieve your goals.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.280]   So whether or not it's the ABC method
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.180]   or it's the SMART method or the SMARTER method,
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.060]   again, all acronyms coined not by me but by others
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.980]   previous to this conversation,
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.120]   you're going to find elements of specificity
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.900]   and measurability showing up again and again.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.780]   So these are key features of any protocol
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.220]   that you are going to use
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.540]   in order to try and set and achieve your goals.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.800]   And I should mention that setting specific goals
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.660]   and clearly defining the verbs
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.060]   that you're going to engage in to pursue those goals
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.260]   and defining how long you are going to try
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.780]   and engage in those verbs each week to achieve those goals
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.300]   has significant impact on the probability of success.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.900]   We're not talking about a minor effect.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.860]   In fact, in the original episode I did
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.300]   about goal setting and pursuit,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.720]   I talked about the so-called recycling study.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.220]   I'm not going to describe it in a lot of detail right now,
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.900]   but essentially this study looked at motivating people
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.120]   to recycle more recyclable products in the workplace.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.840]   And what they found was that when people were told
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.500]   what the specific goal was
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   and what specific actions they needed to engage in were
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.100]   and how much of a given batch of refuse,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.180]   so say, you know, after lunch, there's some boxes,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.500]   there's some forks, et cetera, some napkins,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.480]   how much of that refuse they were going to try
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.260]   to put into the recycle versus the trash,
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.180]   it led to a greater than doubling
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.780]   of successful achievement of that goal.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.900]   Now that's a perhaps trivial goal to some of you,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.380]   although let's face it, recycling is important,
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.540]   but that result has been shown again and again and again
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.700]   for different domains of goal setting and pursuit.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.820]   So this thing of setting specificity,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.120]   really spending time with it on paper,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.980]   setting specificity of actions, which specific actions,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.500]   and then setting specificity of how long you are going
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.340]   to engage in each of those actions each week
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.460]   greatly increases the probability that you will achieve
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.880]   that what previously seemed to be a all too lofty goal.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.500]   Earlier I mentioned that during the course
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.480]   of today's episode, we were going to dispel
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.900]   some common myths about goal setting and pursuit.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.660]   So now I'd like to mention two popular myths
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.780]   about goal setting and pursuit.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.300]   The first one is that if we set a post-it,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.720]   you know, a little post-it sticky,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.820]   where you write down what you're trying to achieve
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.520]   and you put that on the refrigerator,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.120]   you put that on your mirror,
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.040]   that it increases the probability
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.180]   that you are going to stick to your goal.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.100]   It turns out that is not the case.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.540]   And the reason for that is that your visual system adapts
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.180]   to whatever is regular in your environment.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.980]   Doesn't matter whether or not that environment is sparse,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.360]   so it only has a few things in it,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.740]   or whether or not it is dense, like a forest.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.280]   Anything that shows up regularly in our visual environment
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.020]   gets canceled out.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.820]   This is actually a basic feature
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.740]   of the way your visual system is wired.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.780]   So for those of you that are taking a sticky note
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.920]   or a magnet or a sign and putting it on your mirror
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.020]   and leaving it there from day to day,
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.980]   maybe that says, you know, run 60 minutes today
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.860]   or study French 20 minutes
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.220]   or whatever the goal happens to be.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.700]   If you leave it there day to day to day,
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.400]   it actually diminishes the likelihood of progress.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.140]   I know that seems kind of hard to believe, but it's true.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.340]   Instead, a better approach is to continually
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.080]   write that thing out each day and put up a new sticky,
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.680]   put it in a new place, perhaps on the refrigerator,
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.920]   sometimes in the kitchen, maybe on the windshield
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.980]   of your car, although of course,
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.300]   remove that while you're driving, et cetera.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.800]   If you are going to incorporate visual reminders
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.120]   in your goal setting and goal pursuit process,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.620]   you want to change those each and every day.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.500]   This is actually something that perhaps app developers
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.020]   will start to incorporate because I think the notifications
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.040]   that come through on various apps designed to remind us
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.900]   to do certain things can be helpful,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.460]   but there too, we tend to attenuate to them
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.820]   and we simply either do not notice them
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.020]   or we start to swipe them away over time.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.260]   So visual reminders can be very effective.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.540]   If you want to use them, great.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.460]   You certainly don't have to, but if you're going to use them,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.420]   you want to update them every single day.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.180]   Otherwise your visual system and certainly the areas
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.600]   of your brain that are associated with assessing novelty
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.240]   and emotionality will simply start to cancel those away.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.400]   So the first common myth that we're dispelling
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.580]   is what I call the post-it fallacy.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.540]   The idea that if you write something down on a post-it
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.280]   and you post it in an area that you frequent every morning
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.700]   or every day or every night,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.060]   that you stand a higher probability of adhering
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.500]   to what is on that post-it, that is simply not true.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.960]   You would want to replace it every day
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.740]   and you would also be wise to move that post-it
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.640]   to different locations.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.060]   The second myth is that if you want to increase
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.480]   your motivation toward pursuing a goal
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.000]   and you want to increase the probability
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.860]   that you will achieve that goal,
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.320]   that you should engage in so-called accountability,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.900]   meaning that you should tell people
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.140]   you are going to achieve that goal.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.340]   Now, I realize that there are some prominent examples
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.620]   in pop culture of people posting something on social media
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.940]   and saying, in three years,
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.920]   I'm going to be playing in Wembley Stadium
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.620]   or in two years, watch,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.160]   I'm going to be at the top level of my game,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.480]   whatever that game happens to be.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.260]   Sure, there are examples of that.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.540]   And those are beautiful and inspiring examples.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.180]   However, the scientific data tell us
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.340]   that if we inform people around us,
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.280]   that for instance, we are going to write a book
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.220]   or that we're going to start a podcast
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.980]   or that we are going to run a marathon
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.420]   or whatever it happens to be,
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   more often than not, we get feedback
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.140]   that is generally positive in form.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.220]   I think that's good and to be expected, frankly.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.780]   If a friend tells us, "Hey, I'm going to write a book
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.900]   or I'm going to pursue a new fitness goal
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.780]   or I'm going to learn a language,"
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.940]   we say, "Great, go for it.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.860]   You can totally do it.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.340]   You're very likely to succeed.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.300]   Go for it.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.420]   How do you want me to support you?
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.940]   Is there anything I can do to support you?"
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.380]   Those all are frankly healthy exchanges.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.220]   And yet the data tell us that the positive feedback
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.940]   that we get from others
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.020]   when we announce that we're going after a goal,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.860]   activate certain reward systems
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.440]   and motivation systems within our brain
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.420]   that then quickly dissipate
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.860]   and then diminish the probability
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.920]   that we will engage in the type of behaviors
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.500]   that actually lead us to achieve that goal.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.420]   So we have the post-it fallacy
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.700]   and we have the myth of accountability fallacy
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.860]   within the context of goal pursuit.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.780]   I, of course, am not saying that accountability is bad.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.060]   To the contrary, accountability is a great thing,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.540]   both to ourselves and to others.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.900]   It's something that we should all cultivate throughout life.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.820]   I'm merely talking about the myth of accountability
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.140]   in the context of goal pursuit
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.260]   and I'm actually being more specific than that.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.060]   I'm saying don't tell people
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.820]   that you're going to go out and achieve something
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.660]   prior to initiating action toward that goal
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.780]   because in fact, the positive feedback that we get
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.460]   will diminish the probability
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.840]   that we will continually pursue that goal
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.520]   in a way that allows us to achieve it.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.080]   So you could interpret the information I just gave you
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.180]   as meaning that perhaps it's better to tell someone
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.740]   who doubts us that we are going to achieve a goal
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.940]   and then, of course,
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.560]   they're not going to give us the positive feedback.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.780]   We're not going to get all that reward circuitry activated.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:21.140]   Rather, we're going to get the friction circuitry activated
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.360]   of us wanting to prove ourselves and overcome the,
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.740]   let's just say, the lack of faith
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.660]   in our ability to achieve a goal.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.300]   And indeed, that can work.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.740]   There is evidence that can work.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.020]   But then, of course,
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.080]   you have to find someone who doesn't believe in you.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.320]   You have to get them to tell you they don't believe in you.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.620]   And that could have all sorts
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.360]   of deleterious psychological effects
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.320]   that might undermine the goal pursuit process
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.640]   and other things as well.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.780]   So if you are lucky enough to know somebody who doubts you,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.500]   go ahead, tell them that you want to pursue
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.280]   your specific priority goal.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.380]   But more likely than not,
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.060]   the best thing to do is to simply keep that goal to yourself.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.100]   You may need to inform a family member or others
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.700]   of where you will be between the hours of,
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.900]   say, 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.,
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.860]   if you're going to be exercising or learning language
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.520]   or meditating, whatever it is, during that period of time.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.540]   But what I'm referring to here is what I will call
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.160]   the don't tell the world rule.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.660]   Don't tell the world that you're going to achieve X, Y, or Z.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.940]   Just simply tell yourself.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.440]   In fact, I would suggest that the more time you can spend
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.980]   with that one or two or three sheets of paper
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.740]   where you defined the goal,
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.860]   the specific actions that you're going to take,
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.580]   how you're going to measure progress,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.180]   which we'll talk about a bit more later,
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.740]   the more time that you can spend with that goal in your mind
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.220]   and on that paper, the higher the probability
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.820]   that you will achieve that goal.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.500]   That stands in stark contrast to telling everyone around you
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.900]   that you're going to achieve a certain goal,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.380]   the so-called accountability myth
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.780]   or the myth of accountability
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.380]   within the context of goal pursuit
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.380]   would be the more specific way to describe that myth.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.540]   Now, it turns out there is some utility
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:55.100]   to having one person that is a so-called accountability buddy
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.780]   if that person is really
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.500]   just strictly addressing accountability.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.080]   They are reminding you to do what you need to do
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.840]   or they are asking you,
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.540]   did you do what you said you were going to do?
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.480]   But that's a bit more of a tough love accountability model.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.940]   What the don't tell the world rule is really about
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.900]   is not getting the kind of dopamine
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.620]   and other forms of neurochemical reward
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.900]   that come from just simply saying
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.000]   that you're going to pursue a goal
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.860]   because as you'll soon learn,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.300]   that dopamine and other molecules too, of course,
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.660]   are going to be critically important,
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.060]   not just for initiating the sorts of actions
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.160]   required to achieve your goals,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.520]   but for re-engaging and constantly updating your strategy
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.780]   to ensure that you reach your goals.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.420]   It's worth mentioning that the friction model
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.940]   of achieving your goals does work.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.820]   I mean, I, for instance, am somebody that,
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.780]   if I were to say to a family member or friend,
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.700]   hey, I'm going to achieve a particular goal,
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.480]   and they said, no, there's no way you can do it,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.360]   that would recruit a certain set of neural circuits
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.600]   and hormones and neurochemicals in me
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.020]   that would make me much more likely
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.420]   to lean into the required set of efforts
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.700]   to achieve that goal.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.340]   But there's a danger in approaching a given goal that way,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.180]   especially if the goal is something
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.900]   that you already want to pursue,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.960]   which is that then a lot of your effort
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.380]   becomes framed in the context of making someone else wrong
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.620]   as opposed to achieving the goal.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.300]   And of course you can do two things in parallel.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.160]   You can achieve your goal and prove somebody else wrong.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.940]   But as we've talked about in various episodes
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.660]   on motivation and pursuit and the dopamine system,
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.060]   and as we'll talk about a bit more in a few minutes,
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.440]   there's something tremendously powerful
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.200]   about learning how to derive pleasure
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.820]   from the effort process itself.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.340]   That is learning to enjoy the process of pursuing a goal
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.140]   for sake of that goal for yourself,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.160]   rather than trying to pursue a goal
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.100]   simply to prove somebody else wrong.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.640]   I'll just tell you right now that intrinsic motivation,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.980]   motivation that is directly attached
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.140]   to the thing that you are doing and route to a goal
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.120]   is the most powerful and sustainable source of motivation.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.700]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.140]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.460]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   that's designed to meet
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.540]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.160]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.460]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.700]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.380]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.340]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.100]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.260]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.060]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.620]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.840]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.700]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.400]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.160]   I answer AG1.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.860]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.320]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.080]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.740]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.780]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   The final protocol related to goal setting,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.020]   because really up until now,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.240]   we've been talking only about goal setting,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.380]   we haven't yet talked about goal pursuit,
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.040]   is that you want your goal to be measurable.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.960]   And when we say measurable,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.860]   you really have to define two things.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.880]   First of all, you are going to have to define
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.300]   how long you are going to pursue this goal overall.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.340]   In other words, how long you think it will take
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.500]   before you achieve your goal.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.600]   And in addition to that,
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.220]   you are going to have to define
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.380]   how much time you are going to spend
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.740]   pursuing that goal each week or each day.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.980]   Now, there are an infinite number of time blocks
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.460]   that one could use to answer these questions.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.020]   So for instance, you could set an overall yearly goal
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.220]   and you could break it down into monthly goals,
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.840]   where you spend X amount of time on that goal each week
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.460]   and X amount of time on that goal each day,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.260]   and essentially ladder up from the shortest timeframe
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.900]   to the longest timeframe required to achieve that goal.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.220]   And certainly all of that is doable,
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.560]   but that I believe is going to be
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.880]   an overwhelming amount of work
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.940]   and indeed is going to be counterproductive
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.640]   toward achieving your goal.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.860]   What I recommend,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.980]   which of course is gleaned from the scientific literature,
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.120]   or at least the consistencies or the center of mass,
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.780]   that is the major findings that show up again and again
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.580]   in the scientific literature on goal setting and pursuit,
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:17.580]   is that you establish a roughly 12-week period of time
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.660]   to focus on your specific goal.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.780]   Now, of course, achieving the entire goal
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.820]   might take longer than 12 weeks,
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.340]   but chances are it's not going to take shorter than 12 weeks,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.540]   although if it does,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.080]   you could simply close out that goal pursuit
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.700]   and then pursue another goal.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.240]   There's no reason you couldn't do that.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.620]   But there's nothing magical about this 12-week period,
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.460]   but it seems to adhere to a number of things
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.700]   in society and culture and work schedules, in seasonality,
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.020]   meaning the holidays and the shifts in the overall seasons,
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.060]   that works for most goals and most people.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.140]   So a 12-week cycle or roughly a three-month cycle,
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.980]   sometimes called the quarterly cycle,
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.540]   of goal pursuit toward your particular goal,
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.780]   I think is a good macro time to focus on.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.600]   And then within that 12-week cycle,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.980]   to define very clearly how many hours each week
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.260]   end each day and on which days you will pursue that goal.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.300]   Okay, so it's 12-week cycle to pursue your goal.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.860]   That goal might be achieved by the end of that 12 weeks
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.920]   or even prior, it might not be.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.660]   But you set a 12-week cycle or quarterly cycle,
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.980]   or if you prefer to think about it, a three-month cycle,
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.440]   and then you define how many hours per week
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.620]   you are going to spend pursuing that goal.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.280]   And then you define how many hours per day
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.100]   you are going to spend pursuing that goal.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.860]   And then you define which days of the week
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.600]   you are going to pursue that particular goal.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.020]   I think those three numbers, the 12-week quarterly,
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.620]   AKA three-month cycle, the number of hours per week,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.940]   and the number of hours per day and particular days
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.180]   that you're going to spend working on a goal
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.940]   is going to be effective for 90%, if not more,
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.860]   of different types of goals out there.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.320]   And as with defining the specific goal itself,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.480]   I highly recommend that you write this down
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.440]   with a pen or pencil.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.800]   There's just oh so much data to support the fact
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.080]   that writing things down, ideally in complete sentences,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.920]   on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.240]   serves to reinforce the goal setting and pursuit process,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.960]   greatly increasing the probability
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.100]   that you will achieve those goals.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.000]   So what you're really defining in that process
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.200]   are the specific verb actions that you are going to take
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.100]   and the specific quantifiable amount of time
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.380]   that you are engaging in those verb actions
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.200]   in order to achieve your goal.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.100]   What we haven't discussed yet, however,
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.660]   is how to define or quantify the goal itself.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.200]   Now, of course, in different endeavors,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.840]   you're going to have the opportunity to quantify
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   and define goal achievement in different ways.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.880]   So for instance, if you want to be able to run
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   a sub six-minute mile or a sub five-minute mile,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.000]   or if you're really impressive, a sub four-minute mile,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.040]   well, that's a highly quantifiable goal
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.240]   that you can break down into a series of training steps
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.680]   or milestones, meaning that you could quantify
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.340]   at the beginning of your goal pursuit,
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.720]   how long it takes you to run a mile.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.200]   You could then set out to achieve a faster time
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.640]   within two weeks or three weeks,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.960]   and then do the appropriate training
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.800]   to achieve those numbers and simply keep updating that
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.340]   in order to eventually reach your quantifiable goal
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.920]   at 12 weeks.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.160]   Again, you might not complete your goal
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.880]   of running a sub five-minute mile or sub six-minute mile
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   at the end of 12 weeks,
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.600]   but perhaps if your goal is to be able to run
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.700]   a sub five-minute mile by the end of the calendar year,
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.200]   and you're initiating this whole goal pursuit thing
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.400]   on the first of the year, well, then you have 12 months
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.160]   broken into four, three-month cycles,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.300]   and you would essentially set the quantifiable goal
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.280]   at the end of the year, December 31st,
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   perhaps is when you actually do that run
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.880]   where you hopefully would achieve that sub six-minute
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.200]   or five-minute mile, or maybe even four-minute mile,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.540]   and then you backtrack from that date
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.020]   and you set milestones of goals
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.860]   that you're trying to achieve.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.660]   That's a highly quantifiable set of goals
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.600]   because it is literally distance over time.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.860]   However, in a lot of pursuits, in fact,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.420]   I would argue in most pursuits,
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.600]   you don't have that very clear quantifiable result.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.940]   You might have, for instance,
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.260]   the achievement of a doctoral degree or a bachelor's degree
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.360]   or an AA degree or a professional degree of some sort,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.520]   which represents a finish line.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.380]   You could perhaps even attach a grade point average
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.080]   or a publication goal to that.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.040]   But in most endeavors that aren't athletic
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.020]   or aren't within the realm of finance,
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.500]   it becomes much harder to very clearly define your goal
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.760]   in purely quantitative terms.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.080]   So that is the reason why we spend so much time
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   talking about the measurability
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.020]   of the specific amount of time
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.760]   that you're going to engage in the verb actions
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.080]   that each day, which days, each week,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.640]   over the course of these 12-week cycles,
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.660]   because ultimately what's going to allow you
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.900]   to arrive at successful achievement of your goal,
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.700]   regardless of whether or not
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.460]   that goal is highly quantifiable, X number of dollars,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:18.460]   X number of minutes to complete a mile run or swim, et cetera,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.180]   or it's something that's a bit more nebulous
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.640]   in terms of quantifiability like conversational French.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.900]   There's conversational French that you can learn.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.940]   There's also conversational French that incorporates humor
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.880]   or that incorporates good humor,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.240]   or perhaps you want to get better at writing poetry
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.320]   or simply spend time writing poetry.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.480]   Can you quantify the quality of that poetry?
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.520]   Well, perhaps you could win a particular prize for poetry,
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   but I think for most endeavors,
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.560]   they are more loosely defined
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.600]   in terms of their quantifiability.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.340]   Now, we can always attach quantifiability
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.780]   to the ultimate end goal if we choose.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.140]   So for instance, I could decide
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.220]   that I'm going to learn conversational French,
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.800]   and I could decide that the ultimate goal
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.300]   at the end of this 12-week period
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.700]   is to be able to have a 10-minute conversation
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.580]   with somebody who is fluent in French,
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.440]   they're native born in France,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.740]   and that I'm going to make zero mistakes.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.400]   And that's a pretty lofty goal.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.340]   But the point being that if you are picking a goal
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.660]   that is not easily quantifiable,
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.780]   you want to be exceptionally precise
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.180]   about the amount of time that you are going to spend
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.640]   engaging in the specific verb actions
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.920]   that are going to allow you
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.140]   to make progress toward your goal.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.600]   Because ultimately, whether or not
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.060]   it's a highly quantifiable goal
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.180]   or it's a more loosely quantifiable goal
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.180]   in terms of the end goal,
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.140]   the process of achieving goals
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.620]   is always going to be in the form of actions.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.540]   And actions themselves are always quantifiable.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.100]   It's number of hours of dedicated work
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.940]   toward that particular goal.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.020]   A common example of an end goal that's very hard to quantify
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.260]   in terms of the end goal itself
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.140]   is the writing of a book, for instance.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.040]   Now, you could set out to write an 800-page book,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.740]   but most people agree that the length of the book
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.660]   should have something more or less to do with the content
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.720]   and not the other way around.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   In other words, that you don't just want to add words
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.900]   in order to achieve a certain number of pages.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.420]   That said, most all experienced writers
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.160]   will tell you at least two things.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.040]   They'll tell you, first, don't wait for inspiration,
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.080]   simply set a period of time each day
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.120]   that you're going to write and write X number of words
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.900]   or for X amount of time each day,
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.240]   or perhaps even just three days a week.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.860]   But most of the experienced writers that I've spoken to
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.220]   write every single day and they write 800 words per day
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.440]   or 2,000 words per day or 500 words per day,
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.220]   whatever they can do consistently.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.200]   They may do it for time, they may do it for words,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.960]   but they are writing during that time.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.840]   They're not waiting for inspiration to land on them.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.180]   They're not trying to get optimally caffeinated
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.800]   and perhaps they didn't even sleep that well
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640]   the night before.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.580]   In other words, they are dedicated to engaging
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.580]   in a particular number of hours of word generating action,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.520]   rather than trying to focus on getting
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.080]   the number one bestseller at the end
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.200]   after the book is published.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.540]   Of course, they can wish for that number one position
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.240]   on the bestseller chart, but ultimately,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.680]   the greatest probability of achieving that goal
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.200]   is going to come from engaging in a particular number
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.400]   of hours generating a particular number of words each day.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.960]   So again, the highest probability of achieving our goals,
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.200]   of achieving any kind of goal is going to be
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.720]   by understanding the specific verb actions
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.980]   that we need to engage in and then quantifying
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.840]   the amount of time that we engage
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.880]   in those specific word actions
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.000]   and then simply doing those verbs.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.520]   So up until now, we've been talking about goal setting
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.400]   and we really haven't talked about goal pursuit itself.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.280]   So now I'd like to talk about what the scientific literature
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.780]   says is the best protocol for initiating our goal pursuit,
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.800]   for starting toward our goal.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.440]   And to do so, we have to address a set of key questions.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.960]   The questions you have to ask yourself are,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.480]   do I want to pursue this goal?
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.880]   Meaning, am I highly motivated to pursue this goal
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.440]   or even mildly motivated to pursue this goal?
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.860]   Do I want to do the things involved to get this thing,
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.480]   to accomplish this thing?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.400]   Or am I feeling resistance?
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.780]   Do I not want to pursue this goal?
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.500]   Or perhaps this is a day-to-day shift that occurs
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.540]   where some days you're really motivated
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.280]   and other days you are not.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.260]   Now, the reason to ask yourself this set of questions
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.720]   is that the data say that there are two different strategies,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.260]   in fact, two markedly different strategies
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.680]   that you'll want to incorporate,
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.380]   depending on whether or not you're motivated
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.440]   or you are unmotivated to pursue that particular goal,
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.480]   for whatever reason.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.540]   And of course, there's an entire psychology to motivation
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.280]   and you could get a therapist or a coach to work with
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.360]   in order to address that underlying psychology.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.740]   Yes, it might ladder back to childhood issues.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.360]   It might ladder back to esteem things.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.920]   None of that can be covered here
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   in any sort of meaningful depth,
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.460]   because frankly, we each have different circumstances,
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.280]   different pasts, different psychologies.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.120]   There are, however, some universals that we can all apply
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.580]   in order to help us get started toward our goal.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.860]   And this is nested in this whole concept
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.600]   of whether or not we should visualize the end
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.380]   and successful completion of our goal.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.880]   So keep the end in mind as we start off toward a goal,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.600]   or whether or not we should incorporate a different strategy.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.760]   Here's how it goes.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   So if you ask yourself, do I want to achieve this goal?
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.820]   And I would hope the answer is yes,
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.560]   because the overall goal should be something
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.400]   that you want to pursue.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.600]   It should be something that you are
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.920]   deeply desiring to accomplish.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.780]   Then you have to ask yourself next,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.520]   do I want to do the things required to achieve that goal?
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.920]   Now, maybe you don't want to do all of them.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.580]   You only want to do some of them,
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.100]   but given that you've now carefully quantified
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.860]   which specific actions you're going to be doing
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.440]   on which days and for how many hours
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.140]   and how many weeks for these 12-week blocks,
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.660]   you could simply ask yourself,
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.920]   do I want to do this thing today?
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.640]   And if the answer is yes, well,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.160]   then it turns out that spending just one to three,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.760]   maybe five minutes, but even just one minute,
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.580]   visualizing the outcome, the positive outcome, of course,
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.100]   and the feeling state that you may have,
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.200]   because of course you don't know,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.520]   you don't have a time machine,
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.540]   you can't feel yourself into the future,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.600]   but you can make a good guess as to how you might feel
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.280]   in the future if you accomplish that goal.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.420]   Spending one to three, maybe five minutes
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.400]   in a sort of meditation, although sort of a visualization
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.360]   is perhaps the better way to describe it.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.640]   Thinking about that feeling state and the outcome
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.800]   and some of the things that are going to be associated
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.320]   with that outcome turns out to be a great practice
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.040]   to engage in just prior to initiating that day's work
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.880]   toward that goal.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.420]   However, if you arrive to your practice,
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.900]   meaning you show up to the piano, to learn piano,
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.060]   or you're sitting down to the table,
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.760]   or maybe you haven't even gotten enough motivation
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.280]   to go toward the piano or toward your notebook or computer
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.700]   or whatever landscape it is
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.420]   that you are going to be pursuing your goal within,
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.900]   and you are having, quote unquote,
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.240]   a hard time getting motivated toward that goal,
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.900]   well, then it turns out,
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.400]   what the scientific literature tells us,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.440]   is that visualizing the end, keeping the end in mind,
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.400]   positive visualization of all the good things
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.760]   that you'll experience when you achieve that goal
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.660]   is not going to be an effective strategy to motivate you.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.520]   Rather, if you are not feeling motivated,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.600]   then what the scientific literature tells us
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.520]   is that you actually want to spend one to three,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.000]   maybe five minutes visualizing failure,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.240]   visualizing how terrible you will feel
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.660]   if you did not achieve your goal,
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.100]   visualizing severe consequences,
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.960]   perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.180]   gosh, I set a goal, I've set a 12-week block,
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.540]   I quantify it, I know I want to do this,
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.740]   here I have the time to do it,
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.060]   and I'm simply just not doing it.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.420]   And in that case, you would think, okay,
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.300]   well, you should kind of build yourself up,
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.060]   maybe call a friend, text a friend, get some encouragement.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.340]   No, the scientific literature tells us
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.800]   that when we are not motivated,
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.880]   and it is a goal that we actually want to pursue,
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.520]   and of course, here I'm talking about
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.720]   adaptive goal pursuit,
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.740]   meaning things that are going to enrich your mental health,
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.280]   physical health, et cetera,
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.320]   not things that are going to be detrimental to us.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.600]   Well then, if you're not feeling motivated,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.900]   you want to spend one to three, perhaps five minutes
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.580]   meditating, concentrating on
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.000]   what it's going to feel like to fail,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.120]   and the fact that you are not succeeding,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.440]   but indeed that you are failing.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.080]   And I know this sounds like rather harsh advice,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.840]   that this protocol sounds like
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.080]   kind of a self-flagellating protocol.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.960]   It's not intended to be self-flagellation.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.720]   In fact, it should not be self-flagellation,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.600]   but rather what you want to do when you are not motivated
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.080]   is to think about failure and what that failure
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.200]   at the end of 12 weeks will feel like.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.520]   And the reason for that is that the data tell us
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.520]   that when we visualize positive outcomes,
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.240]   yes, it deploys certain neurochemicals in our brain and body
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.120]   that make us feel good.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.480]   Although frankly, if you've heard that
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.580]   imagining something creates the same neurochemical
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.540]   and neural circuit states in the brain
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.960]   as actually experiencing that thing,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.900]   that is simply not true.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.740]   That's a myth.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.920]   We've talked about this in previous episodes.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.760]   That's simply not true.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.600]   But if you are having a hard time getting motivated
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.760]   toward a goal that you actually want to achieve,
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.100]   then spending that short amount of time
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.200]   thinking about how lousy you'll feel
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.560]   when you don't achieve it
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.280]   recruits certain elements
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.880]   of your so-called autonomic nervous system.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.800]   It creates shifts in the release of
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.200]   things like epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.280]   even release of the so-called reward molecule, dopamine,
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.720]   which in fact is not the molecule of reward.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.720]   It is the molecule of motivation.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.860]   And it's associated with pain.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.880]   It's associated with negative thoughts.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.360]   And of course it's associated
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.920]   with positive thoughts and outcomes.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.080]   But basically what I'm saying is
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.840]   if you are highly motivated to do something,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.760]   you're ready to go,
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.880]   spend one to three minutes, maybe five,
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.520]   visualizing the positive outcomes
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.480]   that you're going to experience
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.640]   when you ultimately finish out that 12-week cycle
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.940]   as a consequence of all the great work that you've done.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.160]   If, however, you are not motivated,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.440]   you're feeling like, I don't want to do this thing.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.360]   I'm procrastinating.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.580]   I'm just not feeling like doing it.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   Yes, I want to achieve the goal,
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.800]   but I just don't feel like doing it.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.080]   Well, then your task is to take one to three,
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.040]   maybe five minutes,
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.460]   and think about how much more lousy you will feel
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.100]   when you do not achieve that goal at the end of 12 weeks.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.160]   And that, the data tell us,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.720]   recruits certain elements of your nervous system,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   your hormonal system that are more successful
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.060]   in getting you into action,
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.740]   into starting toward your goal
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.560]   than were you to try and build yourself up
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.060]   towards all that positivity.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.720]   So yes, indeed, there is a place for negative thinking.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.840]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.520]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.880]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.360]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.920]   to help you better understand your body
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.800]   and help you meet your health goals.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.120]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.460]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.680]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.260]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.300]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.180]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.320]   about hormones, and so on,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.640]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.400]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.320]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.300]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.600]   and behavioral, supplement, nutrition,
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   and other protocols to adjust those numbers
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.840]   to bring them into the ranges that are ideal
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.540]   for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.840]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.040]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.700]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.280]   and energy regulation.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.720]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.520]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.280]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.880]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.680]   Now, in terms of tools or protocols
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.880]   to both initiate and to sustain effort
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.540]   during your goal pursuit process,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.960]   we need to think about the specific time domain
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.800]   or the amount of time that we're trying to do that within.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.240]   So for instance, there are tools that you can use
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.100]   to stay motivated within the one-hour learning block
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.840]   that you happen to be doing on Monday morning, for instance,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.540]   and there are other tools and protocols
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.920]   that you can incorporate towards staying motivated
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.560]   from one day to the next or from one week to the next.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.560]   But I think the most useful of those tools
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.160]   are going to be the tools that you incorporate
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.680]   to stay motivated within a given training block
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.480]   or practice block toward your goal,
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.500]   because what I just described a few minutes ago
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.880]   was the process of how to initiate your daily work, right?
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.140]   You ask yourself that question, am I motivated?
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.540]   The answer could be yes, could be no.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.860]   If you really want to get quantitative about it,
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.440]   you could give yourself a one to 10 score,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.920]   10 being the most motivated.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.720]   Frankly, I'm not that quantitative about that sort of thing.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.840]   I'm more subjective about it,
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.520]   but I know some of you are real number junkies
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.900]   and you really like to quantify everything,
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.400]   keep a journal and look back,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.680]   see how that relates to your sleep.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.000]   Some people are of that orientation.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.660]   Other people like myself are simply going to sit down
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.640]   and say, okay, it's time.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.220]   It's time to train or it's time to practice,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.440]   whatever the thing may be.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.480]   How motivated am I?
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.520]   Am I, I don't know, like a six out of 10 or a seven out of 10?
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.880]   Okay, I'm ready to go.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.680]   I'm going to visualize the end in mind in a positive way.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.200]   Or if I'm a two out of 10
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.280]   or anything less than a four out of 10,
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.920]   I'm thinking I'm not that motivated.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.960]   So then I'm going to basically scare myself
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.900]   into doing the work that day.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.080]   So that's how you initiate the work each day.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.880]   And I just gave you a couple of quick examples
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.380]   of how you could quantify that.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.680]   Took me about 30 seconds to do that example out loud.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.600]   Take you about 30 seconds to do.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.680]   But again, if you want to quantify it in more detail
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.240]   and write it down and relate it to other things,
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.620]   be my guest.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.280]   So now you already have a science-based protocol
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.140]   for how to get started each day toward your goal.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.860]   Now, what about within the one or two hour block
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.560]   or perhaps 90 minute block that you're going to use
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   to pursue your goal?
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.920]   And here, it's very important
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.000]   that you have a number of tools that will allow you
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.880]   to both set the optimal amount of focus
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.580]   so that you're really concentrating on pursuing that goal.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.960]   You're concentrated on the verb actions
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.540]   that will deliver you to that goal
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.020]   is perhaps the best way to state that.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.920]   And that you can constantly update
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.300]   or renew your level of focus should it start to dissipate.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.160]   Now, I want to be clear.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.600]   I've done entire episodes about focus
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.800]   and how to increase focus with behavioral tools,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.740]   everything related to meditation,
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.200]   which indeed can increase your ability to focus.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.540]   I've talked about nutritional tools, supplementation tools,
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.440]   prescription drug-related tools.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.680]   There's a lot of information on that.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.880]   You can simply go to Hubermanlab.com,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.800]   put focus into the search function,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.240]   and it will take you to not only those episodes
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.880]   and the toolkit for that,
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.480]   but the specific timestamps for that.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.680]   But what we are going to talk about now
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.800]   is not about how to increase focus per se.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.960]   Rather, it's about how to use focus,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.720]   in particular, visual focus,
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.840]   in order to increase your
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.000]   or maintain your level of motivation
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   within a given learning block,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.520]   within a given batch of time on a given day
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.880]   where you are pursuing your goal.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.460]   You're engaging in that practice,
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.560]   which of course will include frustration, anxiety.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.540]   It has to, if you're going to get any better.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.960]   And how to set that motivation
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.920]   and keep that motivation throughout that hour
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.160]   or 90 minutes or two hours is critical.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.080]   So how do you do that?
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.040]   Well, it turns out it's fairly straightforward.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.280]   So it's anchored in the fact that your cognitive focus,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.920]   your ability to maintain a narrow cone of attention,
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.600]   as well as your bodily state of readiness
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.640]   and your mental state of readiness to perform work
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.920]   is powerfully anchored to your visual system.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.000]   As many of you have heard me say before,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.960]   your eyes are actually two pieces of brain.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.160]   I mean, to be more specific,
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.040]   the neural retinas that line the back of your eyes,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.760]   like pie crusts, are literally two pieces
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.000]   of your central nervous system of your brain
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.820]   that were extruded from the cranial vault during development.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.340]   So yes, these two bits, and for those listening,
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.160]   I'm just pointing to my eyes.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.060]   Your eyes are two pieces of brain outside of your skull
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.960]   and your eyes can view things broadly.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.000]   So you can so-called soften your gaze
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.420]   and view the entire horizon.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.280]   You can see the periphery of the room by relaxing your eyes.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.500]   You can actually do this now.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.660]   In fact, when you drive, most of the time you're doing this.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.640]   You're not looking at a particular focal point.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.200]   You're viewing things in so-called panoramic vision.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.340]   And of course you can draw your visual focus
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.360]   to a particular location,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.640]   what we call a vergence eye movement.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.160]   That is you're bringing your eyes in toward the center,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.200]   toward your nose a little bit,
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.720]   and you're focusing them in a more narrow cone
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.620]   of visual attention.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.040]   This is something you can do
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.960]   almost imperceptibly to others.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.400]   Although if we were to measure your eye movements,
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.240]   what we would see is that your eyes are actually moving
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.960]   inward a little bit toward your nose
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.400]   when you do this vergence eye movement
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.340]   and narrowing that cone of visual attention.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.200]   And then they're relaxing into a state
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.880]   of being slightly further out from your nose,
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.080]   not the eyes themselves, of course,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.320]   they can't move within the sockets,
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.860]   but the pupils of your eyes are moving out a bit
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.720]   from your nose and you're in so-called panoramic vision.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.280]   So essentially what I'm saying is that you can narrow
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.240]   or broaden your visual attention.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.100]   And that's something that can take a little bit of practice.
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.480]   I highly recommend that you try this
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.760]   and that you practice it a little bit,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.820]   but indeed everyone has the neural machinery
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.480]   to do this from birth.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.600]   This is not something that requires neuroplasticity
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.500]   to be able to do.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.520]   You can do this right now.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.160]   You can narrow your visual attention.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.640]   You can expand or relax your visual attention
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.040]   and thereby narrow or relax your visual field
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.560]   from being smaller or larger.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.000]   There are data that show
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.080]   that when we narrow our visual attention
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.000]   and we hold that narrow visual attention on a spot,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:29.840]   several things happen.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.480]   First of all, there's recruitment of circuitry
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.440]   within the so-called brainstem
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.640]   that then deploys neurochemicals
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.120]   that increase our level of alertness and arousal.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.440]   That's right, when you focus your visual attention
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.260]   on a more narrow location or one location in front of you,
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.220]   and you hold that focus,
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.560]   you are causing the release of neurochemicals
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.440]   that increase your overall level of alertness
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.360]   in the brain and body.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.160]   Conversely, when you relax your visual focus,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.740]   so-called panoramic vision,
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.820]   you are turning off that recruitment.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.720]   You're not actively recruiting molecules
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.400]   for relaxation within the brain,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.940]   but you are turning off this release
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.600]   of the neurochemicals associated
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.980]   with increasing focus and arousal.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.200]   So why am I talking about this
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.680]   in the context of goal pursuit?
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.200]   Well, if you are feeling lack of motivation at any point
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.080]   within a given training block or bout as I'm calling it,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.960]   this could be at the beginning,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.300]   this could be five minutes in,
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.160]   this could be half an hour in,
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   you would be wise to pick a visual target,
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.660]   ideally a visual target that is within the general range
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.160]   of the work that you're trying to perform.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.680]   In other words, if you're doing desk work
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.660]   or the piece of paper,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.480]   you would draw that visual target on a piece of paper
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.560]   approximately the same distance that you were reading
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.280]   or that you were looking at music.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.200]   You can tell how little playing a piano
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.040]   I've done in my life,
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.160]   but the point being that you set the visual target
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.440]   at approximately the same distance
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.520]   that you would be performing your particular work.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.260]   So if you're doing a sport,
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:05.260]   the distance might be some many meters off in the distance,
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.920]   whereas if you're doing desk work of some kind,
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.340]   then it might be much closer.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.660]   And then you focus your eyes on that location
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.660]   and you actively work to maintain that focus
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.580]   just like I'm doing now into the camera
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.200]   for a given period of time.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.220]   And I recommend that you set a timer
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.720]   and that you of course allow yourself to blink
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.080]   like I just did there,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.680]   and that you try and achieve at least 30 seconds,
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.920]   but even better would be 60 seconds,
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.880]   even better would be 90 seconds
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.320]   of that focused vergence eye movement
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.760]   during which several things happen,
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.480]   including the deployment of those neurochemicals
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.100]   from the brainstem that I talked about before,
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.600]   which are going to increase your level of autonomic arousal
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.840]   and also increase your level of focus further.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.620]   And there, I'm not just talking about visual focus,
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.960]   I'm talking about cognitive focus.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.800]   It has also been shown that when we focus
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.660]   on a particular point in the way that I'm describing here,
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.920]   that it increases our so-called systolic blood pressure.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.760]   As many of you know,
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.940]   blood pressure is always described to us
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.240]   as a given number over another number.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.540]   And the first number is the so-called systole
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.640]   or systolic pressure,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.440]   which is the amount of pressure in your vascular system
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.880]   when the heart beats as the fluid of your blood
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.520]   is pumping through the arteries, veins,
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.440]   and capillaries of your system.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.280]   And then the bottom number is the amount of pressure
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.180]   within those arteries, veins, and capillaries
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.240]   in between heartbeat.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.160]   So it's the systolic over the diastolic.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.640]   And what we know is that visual focus,
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.120]   and here I'm still holding mine now on the camera,
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.360]   so for those of you listening,
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.680]   I probably blinked once or twice,
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.700]   but I'm really trying hard to maintain my focus
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.320]   directly within the camera.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.200]   This visual focus increases the systolic blood pressure,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.120]   it increases the deployment of those neurochemicals
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:47.960]   from the brainstem,
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.840]   and we know it also can recruit the liberation of molecules
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.300]   such as dopamine and some associated molecules
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.140]   elsewhere in the brain that together act in a synergistic
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.720]   way to increase our level of focus and motivation.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.220]   This is based, again, on work describing the neural circuitry
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.620]   of what I'm describing here,
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.020]   and work from Emily Balchetes' lab,
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.520]   which has shown that if people focus on a target,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.360]   on a goal line,
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.040]   literally a physical location within their environment,
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.240]   and then they initiate some work,
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.760]   it could be physical work or cognitive work,
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.160]   not only do they experience significantly decreased levels
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.000]   of perceived effort while engaging in that work,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.680]   but they also complete that work
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.920]   in a significantly reduced amount of time,
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.800]   meaning that within a given training bout or training block,
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.520]   you are able to get significantly more work done,
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.180]   and you perceive that as less effortful
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.720]   or requiring less effort
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   than had you not done this visual focus.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.520]   Now, I've been doing this for quite some time now
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.500]   into the camera.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.140]   This is actually a practice that I've been doing
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.640]   for well over a decade,
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.060]   and it's actually a practice that I use when I podcast
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.240]   or when I post on social media,
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.960]   it's part of the reason why I'm accused of being
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.400]   a non-blinker quite often,
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.160]   but I want to remind people that you are allowed to blink,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.320]   don't let your eyes dry out,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.800]   it's perfectly fine to blink,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.780]   it's not going to inhibit the effectiveness of this protocol.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.280]   But I don't think I can really overstate how valuable
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.560]   this sort of protocol is.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.040]   First of all, it's completely behavioral,
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.400]   it costs nothing, it's completely safe,
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.800]   as long as you remember to blink,
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.480]   and it allows you to increase your level of focus,
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.060]   your level of motivation,
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.600]   and the sustainability of your focus and motivation
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.760]   while in goal pursuit.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.740]   So it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.380]   and it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.580]   and then lean into whatever it is,
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.540]   your writing process, your running process.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.460]   It's something that you could do repeatedly
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.780]   throughout that learning bout,
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.700]   and it's something that you can practice offline
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.340]   a little bit away from that training bout
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.900]   as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.180]   so that then you can incorporate it very quickly
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.780]   and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.360]   during these different learning bouts.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.940]   Again, it's a highly valuable tool
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.780]   that's grounded in neural circuitry,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.840]   grounded in neurochemistry,
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.520]   and that Emily Balchetis' lab has shown
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.920]   in numerous domains, physical pursuits,
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.800]   cognitive pursuits can really help people
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.080]   achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.240]   or at least with less perceived effort and more quickly.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.800]   Now, we can get a bit more granular
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.900]   about the incorporation of this tool, this protocol,
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.900]   but before we do, we should acknowledge
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.020]   that all of the things that lend themselves
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:23.700]   to improved cognitive focus and physical ability
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.900]   still hold true, right?
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.700]   You still need to get good sleep
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.940]   as many nights of your life as you possibly can.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.760]   You still need to eat properly.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.000]   You still need to try and limit your stress.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.940]   We have podcast episodes related to all of those topics.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.780]   We have toolkits available at zero cost
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.880]   related to all of those topics.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.860]   I'm not saying that this visual focus
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.520]   or visual target training is the only tool
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.580]   that you should incorporate.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.680]   It's a tool that you want to superimpose
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.640]   on the foundation of all the things
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.120]   that bring you to your practice
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.860]   with the best possible cognition,
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.240]   the best possible physical readiness,
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.740]   and that when added to that foundation of excellent sleep,
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.840]   excellent nutrition, social connection,
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.320]   sunlight in the morning, et cetera,
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.980]   is going to increase the probability
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.700]   that you're going to make those learning bouts
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.260]   as effective as possible.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.220]   Now, some of you may be thinking,
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.040]   elevating your blood pressure is bad.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.380]   Why would I want to elevate my blood pressure?
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.420]   Ah, well, it turns out that the increases
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.020]   in systolic blood pressure achieved
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.340]   with this visual target training
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.220]   or focusing on a finish line for some period of time
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.100]   are transient and they are perfectly safe.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.060]   So essentially what it does is it boosts
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.460]   or bolsters the activity of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.500]   It kick-starts the deployment of those chemicals
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.100]   and those neural circuits that then allow you
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.400]   to be motivated for some period of time.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.260]   But then that is a transient increase in autonomic arousal,
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.740]   which is why perhaps every 20 minutes
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.140]   or perhaps on the hour, you might stop,
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.840]   do a 30-second or 60-second visual target training,
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.980]   then lean back into your process
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.280]   of however it is that you are pursuing your goal.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.880]   I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.100]   doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.340]   it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.400]   The easiest way to do that is to go outside
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.560]   or to be outside and to view a horizon
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.760]   and not look at any one particular point on the horizon.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.580]   But if you're indoors, as I am now,
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.360]   you can also just relax your eyes,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.980]   you know, sort of blinking a few times
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.160]   and getting rid of that vergence eye movement
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.100]   and try and visualize the corners of the room
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.240]   or the sides of the room, rather,
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.860]   the floor and the ceiling all at once.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.340]   That's a good way to explain
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.980]   how to so-called relax your eyes
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.740]   and take you out of that vergence eye movement.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.040]   And I say this because a lot of people will feel
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.140]   when they're pursuing their goal that it's kind of fatiguing
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.660]   so you have to remember to breathe, right?
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.400]   You still want to breathe as you're pursuing your goal
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.980]   and you certainly want to be visually focused on your goal
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.460]   so you're cognitively focused on your goal
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.420]   and you're motivated, but that from time to time,
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.460]   you also relax, take a moment, shake things off,
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.340]   look into your panoramic vision mode
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.780]   and then go back to your mode of goal pursuit.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.140]   Now, there are a few other protocols
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.540]   that might seem oh so simple,
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.220]   but frankly are oh so effective
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.720]   that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.080]   The first of those is actually something
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.660]   that I'm borrowing from Tim Ferriss
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.220]   who did a post on Instagram, which we will link to,
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.960]   which I think is just spectacular,
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.980]   which is 30 things that he wished he had known
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.820]   when he was 20.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.660]   And while the internet is chock-a-block full of such lists,
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.340]   that particular list is truly impressive.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.220]   Those are things that I too wish I had known when I was 20,
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.940]   but also when I was 30 and 40 and so on.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.820]   But one particular thing on that list of 30
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.900]   is particularly relevant now,
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.180]   which is that the best productivity app
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.820]   is already on your phone,
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.060]   which is to put your phone into airplane mode
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.820]   or more ideally,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.600]   and this is the one that I try my best to incorporate,
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.020]   to simply turn the phone off and remove it from my workouts
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.840]   or my attempts to learn language
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.380]   or my attempts to learn anything.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.360]   I realize that some people need to keep their phone with them
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.340]   for reasons related to communicating with family
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.320]   or coworkers, et cetera.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.060]   That's fine if you need your phone,
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.880]   but to the extent that you can remove yourself
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.940]   from distractions,
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.520]   that's certainly going to enhance your ability
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.540]   to focus on what you need to focus on
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.340]   in pursuing your goals.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.260]   That sort of stands without saying, it's kind of a duh.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.660]   And yet I think a lot of people are searching far and wide
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.740]   for the productivity app, for the secret hack,
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:15.140]   for the thing that's going to allow them to be productive.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.540]   And oftentimes there are do's, actions that we can take
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.800]   in order to become more productive.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.320]   We're talking about some of those today.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.940]   We've talked about those in other episodes,
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.300]   but there are of course important don'ts.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.920]   So don't have your phone facing up
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.340]   with wifi and cellular service on
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.980]   if you want to be productive at something
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.040]   that doesn't evolve your phone.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.540]   Ideally, you'll turn it over, you'll turn it off,
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.420]   you'll get rid of it, you'll put it in the next room.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.500]   If you're like me, you'll sometimes lock it in the car.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.620]   I think the most extreme that I've ever gone
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.920]   to ensure that I didn't engage with my phone
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.700]   during goal pursuit was during the early days
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.880]   of having my laboratory
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.100]   and I was writing multiple grants in parallel,
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.900]   which is an immense amount of work.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.760]   I would walk into the laboratory in the morning
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.220]   and I would hand a student or postdoc my phone
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.000]   and I'd say, don't give this back to me until 5 p.m.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.140]   And if I ask for it back, if I even ask for it once,
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.980]   everyone in the lab gets $500.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.340]   There were quite a few people in my lab
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.060]   and so it's a significant cost to that.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.560]   And I must tell you there were numerous times
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.680]   throughout the day when I impulsively just thought,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.980]   okay, I'm going to need my phone.
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.060]   Damn it, I don't want to have to do it.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.000]   And I also wanted to demonstrate to them
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.180]   that I could create an incentive system
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.420]   whereby I could basically scruff myself
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.340]   into getting the work done.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.340]   And indeed, much to their dismay,
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.300]   I never once had to pay them out.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.780]   Although when we got the grants
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.180]   and indeed even when we didn't get the grants,
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.700]   I did take them all to dinner.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.020]   Now, another key protocol for maintaining motivation
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:38.260]   while pursuing your goals stems from our understanding
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.680]   of the dopamine reward and motivation pathways,
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.060]   topics for which I have done multiple,
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.220]   indeed, three podcast episodes previously,
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.900]   and we can provide a link to all three of those
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.720]   as well as the toolkit that we've published
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.560]   and that's available to you at zero cost on our website
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.420]   about how to regulate dopamine,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.320]   both baseline dopamine stores and peaks in dopamine.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.820]   There's a lot there to be understood and incorporated
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.040]   because it has to do with various things,
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.080]   not just in the realm of goal pursuit,
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.560]   but also feelings of wellbeing,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.000]   staving off depression, things of that sort.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.440]   The dopamine system is linked to,
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.540]   oh, so many important aspects of life,
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.300]   far too many than we could discuss right now.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.260]   And we have those previous episodes
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.160]   in which we do discuss all of that material.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.760]   Nonetheless, it is important to understand
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.240]   that dopamine is the molecule of motivation
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.200]   and to some extent reward, but really motivation.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.020]   And that if you want to maintain consistent motivation
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:40.020]   during say your individual bouts of work toward your goals
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.780]   and from one bout to the next, so not just within a session,
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   but from day to day across sessions and from week to week,
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.900]   and indeed from 12-week cycle to 12-week cycle,
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.640]   if that's required, and from one goal that you set
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.980]   to the next goal that you define and decide to pursue,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.840]   you want to understand this particular feature of dopamine,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.040]   which is that yes, dopamine and its release
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.440]   is highly valuable toward getting more motivated
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.300]   and feeling more motivated,
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.760]   but that it has certain properties related to things
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.480]   like dopamine reward prediction error,
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.280]   baselines of dopamine, et cetera,
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.540]   that make it the case that if you reward yourself
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.580]   every time you reach a milestone,
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.080]   say you finish out an hour or two hours of work,
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.140]   so you treat yourself to something, you reward yourself,
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.020]   that you are going to diminish both the potency
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.640]   of that reward and you're going to reduce
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.560]   your motivation over time.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.840]   That might be surprising to you,
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.640]   but if you were to watch those episodes,
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.360]   it would all become clear as to why that is the case.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.560]   It is also true that if you were to only reward yourself
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.560]   when you accomplish your goal, or perhaps more commonly,
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.040]   if you look at the accomplishment of your goal
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.580]   as the only reward in the whole process of goal pursuit
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.500]   and achievement, that is going to undermine
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.700]   your probability of success as well.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.040]   Rather, the best way to incorporate the mechanics
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.880]   of the dopamine system such that you can achieve
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.120]   not just immediate motivation, but ongoing motivation
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.940]   is to incorporate what is referred to as
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.800]   random intermittent reinforcement,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.440]   which is what the casinos use to keep people playing.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.820]   And it simply means randomly reward yourself
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.800]   and randomly don't reward yourself
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.840]   for successful completion of milestones.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.320]   Those milestones could be within a bout of effort
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.280]   or it could be a cross bouts of effort.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.180]   So let's say you set out at the beginning
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.860]   on your piece of paper to basically, let's say run
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.900]   or practice at some cognitive endeavor,
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.340]   four hours total per week, and you're going to do that
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.760]   Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.200]   Should you reward yourself at the end of each session?
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.940]   Should you reward yourself at the end of each week?
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.580]   The answer is it depends.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.220]   And it should depend in a random intermittent way.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.900]   So the simplest way to do this
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.180]   is whenever you complete a milestone,
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.100]   could be at the end of a day, you did your one hour,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.900]   whatever it was that you designated you were going to do
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.860]   on that particular day, should you reward yourself
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.700]   cognitively or with some physical thing?
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.860]   I don't know what that physical thing might be,
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.100]   but I don't know, it could be a meal, could be a movie,
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.000]   it could be something that you enjoy.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.220]   Well, the answer is you should flip a coin
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.460]   and if it's heads, yes, reward yourself.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.980]   And if it's tails, don't, it's that simple.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.140]   It is that simple.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.860]   It should be 50/50 probability.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.380]   And it's random as to whether or not you reward yourself.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.720]   Now, with physical rewards like monetary rewards
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.040]   or food rewards or a movie or participating
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.340]   in something else that you enjoy,
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.620]   it's a bit easier to define.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.860]   The cognitive rewarding of one's own efforts
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.260]   is something that people really struggle to comprehend.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.460]   But what I'm not referring to when I say cognitive rewards
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.960]   is I'm not referring to saying, yes, I'm the best
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.460]   and really trying to shower yourself with internal praise
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.180]   and tell yourself that you're the greatest thing
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.300]   that ever happened simply
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.460]   because you performed this learning bout.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.140]   What I'm simply referring to
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.540]   is the kind of internal dopamine reward
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.100]   that comes from telling yourself like,
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   yes, I'm making progress, I'm making progress,
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.460]   I'm on the path, I'm able to set a goal and achieve a goal,
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.580]   which might seem like a healthy thing to do psychologically
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.460]   and in fact, it is.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.660]   It's great and I think it's really important
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.860]   that people be able to self-reward themselves,
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.220]   especially self-reward for verbs
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.100]   that put them in a more adaptive stance in life
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.360]   that enhance their mental health,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.460]   physical health and performance.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.500]   And that of course also includes relationships.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.840]   We're not just talking about solitary pursuits here.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.220]   We're talking about pursuits that bring us into the world,
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.860]   that allow us to lean into life with more vigor
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.060]   and with more effectiveness,
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.140]   not just to help ourselves, but to help others.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.740]   So what I'm referring to is completing something
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.860]   and internally patting yourself on the back
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.780]   for having completed that thing.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.460]   That is a good thing to do,
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.180]   but if you want to maintain ongoing motivation,
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.760]   you're not going to do that every time.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.660]   You're not going to punish yourself,
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.540]   but rather you finish out a bout of learning,
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.900]   you flip the coin, let's say it lands tails on that day,
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.820]   you simply shift into the next thing you need to do that day.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.940]   Now, it is not easy to suppress thoughts.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.200]   We know this, it's very hard to suppress negative thoughts,
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.420]   but it's still hard to suppress positive thoughts.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.100]   So internally, if you're glowing
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.280]   from the fact that you performed well,
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.220]   don't try and suppress that, that's okay.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.860]   But if you flip a tails,
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.420]   then you don't want to actively engage
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.860]   in a self-reward process.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:32.220]   However, if you flip the coin and its heads,
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.700]   well, then you should absolutely engage
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.940]   in a self-reward process.
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.100]   And that process should consist of 30 to 60 seconds
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.420]   of closing your eyes, well, you don't have to,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.620]   it works better if you close your eyes,
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.500]   and simply thinking about the fact that,
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.380]   yes, you can set a goal,
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.140]   you can engage in the specific set of questions.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.860]   Do I want to do this practice today?
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.380]   Do I not want to do this practice today?
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.500]   And then the specific set of actions,
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.700]   maybe they involve visual focus,
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.780]   and the other tools we talked about,
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.540]   turning off of your phone, et cetera,
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.500]   you are somebody who can get things done.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   You are somebody that is moving forward
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.580]   toward your particular goal.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.380]   And so you just sort of create a little bit
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.420]   of a positive cognitive loop around that ability
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.220]   that you are in fact building up.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.760]   And that's something that people often overlook,
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.300]   which is that not only is moving toward a goal great
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.660]   because it establishes more robustness
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.100]   in the neural circuits that allow us to perform that thing,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.920]   right, I mean, after all, that's what learning is,
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.780]   eventually you don't achieve the same frustration
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.460]   and errors that you do when trying to perform that thing.
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.220]   Eventually you learn how to play the piano,
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.820]   you learn how to speak conversational French,
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.740]   you run that sub six minute mile,
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.860]   but also the neural circuits associated
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.460]   with self-generated motivation,
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.860]   and with the tools that we're talking about,
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.160]   themselves are subject to neuroplasticity,
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.840]   so those become more robust, and that's fantastic
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.000]   because when you eventually reach one goal,
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.800]   I would hope that you would then update
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.940]   and set out to achieve another goal,
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.580]   and you will find that over time,
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.400]   you will be more effective in achieving other goals
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.380]   by virtue of the work that you did
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.920]   in pursuing a previous goal,
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.640]   because ultimately it's really about defining goals
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.240]   and then learning how to quantify the actions required
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.760]   and then engaging in those actions.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.120]   So there's the specific circuits involved
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.000]   in generating those actions, which are very goal specific,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.080]   and then there are the circuits,
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.380]   which circuits are we talking about?
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.500]   We're talking about that amygdala,
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.280]   the lateral prefrontal cortex, the orbital frontal cortex,
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.580]   and the basal ganglia that we talked about earlier
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.760]   that had been built up, that had been reinforced,
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.300]   because as I mentioned, there is one universal circuit
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.540]   for goal pursuit and achievement.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.460]   So random intermittent reinforcement is the key,
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.980]   and while I spent a good amount of time
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.040]   talking about self-generated cognitive reinforcement,
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.600]   this also applies to any kind of physical rewards,
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.900]   the movie that you're going to reward yourself with,
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.240]   the ice cream cone, the whatever
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.860]   that you're going to reward yourself with,
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.680]   perhaps it's monetary, perhaps it's food,
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.560]   perhaps it's social, random intermittent rewards
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.960]   are the ones that are going to keep you motivated
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.560]   and are going to best increase the probability of success,
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.840]   not just within a given bout of learning,
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.720]   not just day-to-day, not just week-to-week,
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.920]   not just quarter-to-quarter, but across the lifetime.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.160]   An important protocol to incorporate in your goal pursuits
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.400]   is one that I learned from Dr. Maya Shankar
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.480]   when she was a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.000]   and she talked about the so-called middle problem.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.080]   The middle problem is the fact that people tend to have
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.840]   a lot of motivation at the outset of pursuing a goal,
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.880]   although you now know that sometimes,
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.280]   or some people don't have a lot of motivation
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.760]   when pursuing their goal at the start,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.700]   so they need to think about failures
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.820]   and how terrible everything will be,
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.380]   and then they will certainly have motivation,
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.800]   it's going to be a fear-based motivation,
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.740]   but in general, people tend to have more motivation
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.660]   at the start of pursuing a goal,
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.500]   and at the end, when they get close to
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.720]   or they start to perceive the finish line,
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.180]   but that most people experience the so-called middle problem
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.240]   where in the middle of a learning bout
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.980]   or in the middle of the week
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.460]   or in the middle of a 12-week cycle,
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.140]   they are less motivated,
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.840]   and this has actually been quantified in numerous studies,
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.160]   and there are several ways to overcome the middle problem.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.820]   The simplest one is to acknowledge it,
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.700]   to recognize that it's coming,
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.960]   and so when it does come
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.460]   and you're experiencing lower levels of motivation,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.720]   perhaps even increased failure rates
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.300]   and you're not performing as well,
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.440]   you're getting frustrated,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.940]   to know that that's a natural process
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.640]   that everybody experiences,
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.160]   and just knowing that can sometimes allow people
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.520]   to move through that to the place
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.060]   where then they can sense the end of the learning bout
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.940]   or they can sense that they're making some progress,
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.860]   the finish line is there,
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.260]   and then they get that increase in motivation again.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.320]   However, sometimes the middle problem is such a problem
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.880]   that people need some tools to move through it,
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.120]   and the best way to move through the middle problem
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.620]   or in fact to eliminate it
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:59.140]   is actually to make the middle of a learning bout
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.180]   its own separate thing
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.860]   that you acknowledge the presence of
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.860]   and that you break up into three separate bouts.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:08.120]   So here we're talking about carving up
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.920]   the one-hour learning bout or the two-hour learning bout
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.300]   into an initial phase
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.460]   where you either have naturally occurring motivation
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.380]   or you use fear-based visualization
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.900]   to increase your motivation, you lean into that,
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.260]   and then let's assume it's a one-hour learning bout,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.700]   and then at about the 25-minute mark,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.320]   you start to experience lower levels of focus,
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.480]   perhaps then you use the visual target protocol,
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:32.100]   but then you go back into your bout of learning
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.860]   and you're not feeling very motivated, it's hard,
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.840]   your mind is drifting, you want to pick up your phone,
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.940]   you want to do other things,
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.460]   you find yourself doing other things,
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.660]   that's the period of time to take, say,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:46.220]   the 25-minute to 45-minute period within the session
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.480]   and divide it into perhaps three
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.460]   or even four smaller chunks of time,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.680]   and you perhaps have heard of chunking before,
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.560]   chunking is simply breaking something down
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.680]   into smaller chunks that are more achievable,
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.420]   that's simply what we're talking about here,
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.140]   but really chunking up that middle section
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.060]   of a learning bout can be very effective
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.820]   at essentially eliminating the middle problem.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.740]   Now, for those of you that are going to be really nitpicky,
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.440]   you'll say, "Wait, you take that 20 minutes
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.920]   from the 25-minute mark to the 45-minute mark
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.420]   within your hour learning bout,
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.960]   and you divide it up into four little chunks,
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.300]   and in those two middle chunks,
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.580]   I'm going to feel the middle problem
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.060]   for those two middle chunks, ah."
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.740]   Well, that's not actually the way it pans out,
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.540]   fortunately, when you break things down
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.840]   into small enough chunks, you eliminate the middle problem
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.820]   and you experience sustained motivation.
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.560]   Now, the extreme interpretation of that
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.220]   would have you measuring every minute
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.420]   or even every second of a learning bout
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.680]   and having consistent motivation throughout that,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.240]   because for instance, if you can concentrate for 10 seconds,
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.420]   why wouldn't you simply be able
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.500]   to just mark off 10-second increments?
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.460]   Well, at some point, the marking off
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.060]   or the monitoring of those increments
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.260]   is going to be distracting toward the thing
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.820]   that you actually want to do.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.580]   So the simple thing to do
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.220]   is to acknowledge the middle problem, right?
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.500]   The fact that we have more motivation to start,
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.840]   and at the end of our goal pursuit sessions,
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.860]   than we do within the middle,
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.820]   and then to simply chunk that middle section
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.420]   into three, maybe four smaller chunks,
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.600]   and if you need to incorporate things
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.420]   like the visual target protocol,
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:16.780]   one or three or perhaps even eight times
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.540]   within that middle section, so be it.
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.580]   It's going to help you move through
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.900]   with better focus and better motivation.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.620]   And what I just described can, of course,
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.140]   be applied to the longer bouts of effort
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.620]   that don't occur just during one learning bout,
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.020]   but perhaps across the week.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.420]   So for instance, if you are doing four days a week
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.300]   of language learning or fitness training,
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.460]   so maybe it's a Monday, Wednesday,
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.460]   Friday, Saturday type of schedule,
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.100]   you may notice that in the middle of the week,
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.140]   the Wednesday training session tends to be the one
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.340]   that you're less motivated to do for whatever reason.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:46.620]   There could be any reason at all
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.380]   for which the motivation is lower in the middle of the week.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.420]   It doesn't matter.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.460]   Well, in that case, you would want to first acknowledge
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.580]   the presence of the middle problem.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.940]   So you would want to acknowledge
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.500]   that that Wednesday training bout
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.820]   is prone to the middle problem because it is indeed.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.820]   The middle problem, it's in the middle of the Monday
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.620]   and the Friday training bouts.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.780]   So then you would want to approach it
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.560]   with the understanding that it's going to be there
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.860]   and that you are going to need tools and protocols
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:12.900]   that will allow you to overcome it by, for instance,
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:16.140]   taking that one or two hour session on Wednesdays
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.820]   and putting a bit more time toward a visual target protocol
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:22.220]   at the beginning to increase your focus,
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:24.260]   a bit more visualizing failure.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.420]   If you are feeling a motivated,
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.540]   that means not motivated in nerd speak,
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.920]   a motivated toward doing that Wednesday session.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.780]   And you would want to break up that Wednesday session
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.900]   into smaller chunks.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.360]   So instead of looking at that two hour session,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.700]   you might break it up into a series of 15 minutes,
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.900]   smaller learning bouts done consecutively back to back.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.940]   And then in doing so,
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.940]   you have essentially taken that Wednesday session
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.420]   and I'll bet that it becomes
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.140]   at least among your most motivated sessions.
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.860]   So the middle problem exists.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.060]   It's important to acknowledge,
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.300]   and there are tools to overcome the middle problem
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.860]   on any timescale.
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.800]   You simply have to chunk up the middle
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.020]   and approach things with deliberate increased vigor,
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.100]   just as you would, you know,
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.100]   if you're running and there's always a tough hill,
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.440]   you have to really gear up for attacking that hill.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.620]   And then to do that repeatedly in those smaller chunks
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.420]   until you've completed that session.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.420]   So today I've been talking about
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.480]   how to approach goal setting and pursuit
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.700]   at and in and around the specific times
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.340]   that one is engaging in goal setting and pursuit,
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:26.980]   the writing down of goals, defining of goals, the timing,
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.660]   and then the actual training sessions
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.380]   or the practice sessions toward achieving that goal.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.780]   What I haven't talked about is how to show up to all of that
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.620]   in the best possible state of mind and body
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.260]   in order to achieve the best possible results.
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.440]   And of course, there are numerous things that we need to do
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.540]   in order to quote unquote show up at our best,
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.600]   where we would stand the best possibility
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.720]   of performing our best and learning the best
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.300]   in those learning bouts.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.820]   Things like getting adequate sleep,
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.580]   getting sunlight in our eyes early in the day,
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.820]   adequate and proper nutrition, social connection, and so on.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.100]   We talked about all of that in previous podcast episodes,
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.420]   so I'm not going to talk about those again now,
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.940]   but it is important to recognize
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.180]   that the backdrop of our lives, how well we've slept,
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.880]   what's going on in our personal lives
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.260]   will all impact things like motivation
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:16.080]   and frankly, our ability to even identify what's important
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.800]   because if we're dealing with a health crisis
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   or someone close to us is dealing with a health crisis,
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.520]   we tend to have our attention diverted toward that.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.940]   But I do want to acknowledge all of that
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.100]   because it is critically important
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.420]   in defining how you're going to show up to these endeavors
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.820]   and for that matter, all endeavors.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.900]   Now, with that said, there are a few things that you can do
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.300]   in order to try and optimize your ability to focus
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.860]   and your level of motivation during your goal pursuits.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.080]   And there are some really interesting data and protocols
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.940]   that I haven't talked so much about on this podcast ever
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.860]   that are relevant to today's discussion.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.760]   And this relates to our so-called
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.300]   circadian rhythms in attention.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.940]   We have robust rhythms in our ability to focus
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.820]   and our level of motivation that vary across the 24 hour,
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:05.660]   AKA circadian cycle with a regular rhythmicity
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.140]   that is independent of how badly we want a goal
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.620]   or how afraid we are of failure, right?
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.340]   All the stuff about motivation and fear of failure
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.180]   and desire, et cetera, all of that is still true
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.620]   but we all have a naturally occurring rhythm
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.380]   of rise and fall and return to rise and fall
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.360]   of our levels of attention and motivation.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.020]   And this is something that's been described beautifully
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.140]   in the scientific literature.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.100]   In fact, I'll provide a link
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.260]   to what I consider a really nice review on this topic.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.940]   This is a review that was published by Pablo Valdez
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:39.660]   in the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine in 2019
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.220]   entitled Circadian Rhythms in Attention.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.540]   And there's a lot of information within this review
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.860]   but we can distill out a couple of useful gems from it.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.940]   So if you are somebody who is embarking
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.740]   on the pursuit of a goal, which is particularly hard,
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.380]   that's going to require a really high level
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.180]   of motivation and focus,
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.040]   know that there are three times during the day
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.380]   when you stand to have the greatest level
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.620]   of focus and attention.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.540]   And of course, this will vary
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.940]   depending on when you went to sleep at night
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:08.980]   and when you wake up,
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.140]   there's natural variation in circadian rhythms
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:13.180]   but it's worth knowing that most people find
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.980]   that their level of attention and motivation
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.580]   is going to be highest 30 minutes,
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.500]   three hours and 11 hours after waking up, okay?
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.400]   So 30 minutes, three hours and 11 hours after waking up.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.740]   And this relates to a number
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:29.040]   of important biological principles related
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.380]   to circadian shifts in body temperature,
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.960]   which are also related to circadian shifts.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.100]   That means changes around the 24 hour cycle
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.860]   in the release of particular neurochemical.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:44.520]   So the amount of dopamine available to be released
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.860]   by any sort of goal pursuit or reward,
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.740]   the amount of serotonin available,
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.940]   lots of neurochemistry in there,
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.380]   lots of neural circuitry,
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.360]   but these heightened levels of focus and motivation
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.880]   that just occur naturally,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.340]   regardless of what goal one is trying to pursue.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.620]   In fact, regardless of whether or not
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:00.480]   you're trying to pursue any goal,
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.900]   30 minutes, three hours and 11 hours after waking,
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.700]   your focus and motivation are going to be their greatest
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.400]   relative to other times in that 24 hour cycle.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.220]   Now, as I tell you this,
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:12.620]   I can imagine that some of you are thinking,
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:16.940]   "Great, I'm going to schedule one bout of goal pursuit,
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.740]   three hours after waking and another one,
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.300]   11 hours after waking."
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.620]   Great, if you can do that and that fits with your work
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.060]   and other demands of life, your relationships, et cetera,
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.020]   terrific.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.660]   However, I don't want this 30 minute,
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:34.340]   three hour and 11 hour protocol to be considered a rule.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.420]   And here's why.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.540]   Most people don't have a tremendous degree of control
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.500]   over their schedule.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.980]   Things like work and family and other demands
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:44.900]   constrain them in terms of when they can get the work in.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.500]   And while I do think it's extremely valuable
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.980]   to schedule the specific time or roughly the specific time,
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.500]   even though that's an oxymoron,
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.780]   meaning a period of time during the day,
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.340]   say before 9 AM or between nine and noon
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.140]   that you are going to carry out your goal pursuit endeavors.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:02.700]   I've talked about this in previous podcasts.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.300]   Some people do very well by scheduling an exact time
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.880]   from noon to two, I'm writing.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:10.420]   Other people like myself do a little better
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.820]   if I set a constraint, but it's a little bit broader,
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.380]   such as I'm going to exercise before 9 AM.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.940]   That could be anytime before 9 AM.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:21.820]   Or I'm going to engage in language learning
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:25.180]   sometime between say 6 PM and 9 PM
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.340]   as opposed to setting a specific time.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.620]   That's just what works best for me.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:31.040]   People vary in terms of whether or not they respond best
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.100]   to setting a specific time or a time block
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.420]   and setting up these kinds of barriers
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:37.040]   after which you are essentially telling yourself
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.100]   you won't do it.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.740]   But, and this is a very important but,
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.580]   it is most important that you actually engage
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:46.540]   in the goal pursuit.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.780]   And I experienced this recently.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.780]   I'm trying to run more these days.
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:51.700]   I still enjoy doing resistance training.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.340]   I still run three days a week,
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:54.820]   but I'm trying to run a little bit longer
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.340]   as opposed to just doing the one long run per week
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.380]   and then two shorter runs later in the week.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.220]   I've talked about this
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.860]   in my optimal fitness protocol episode.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.960]   If you want to check that out or check out the PDF
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.980]   where it's all distilled down to one or two pages,
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.220]   if you like.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.900]   But in any event, these days,
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.300]   I'm trying to extend the amount of time that I'm running.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.460]   I'm just enjoying that.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.700]   It's kind of a throwback for me
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.780]   to when I ran across country as a senior in high school.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.260]   And this was the time of year
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.280]   when I would start getting ready for the fall season.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.980]   So I'm enjoying running more.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.220]   And just this last week,
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.500]   I had the experience of having a very full Sunday.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.100]   And that's usually the day when I run in the morning
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.960]   or hike during the middle of the day.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.060]   And I simply did not get around to it
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.100]   because I had a lot of other important things to do.
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.380]   And what I found was 9 p.m. rolled around,
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.580]   10 p.m. rolled around.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:43.320]   And I started thinking like, I wish I had gone running.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.820]   My Monday was going to be busy.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.780]   So what did I do?
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.200]   I laced up my shoes and I went for a run at 10 p.m.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.180]   Something I haven't done since college
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.020]   or maybe even high school.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:53.420]   And I ended up running for 90 minutes
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.080]   from 10 p.m. until 1130 p.m.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.980]   Definitely not the optimal time for me to go running.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.020]   In fact, I was thinking, oh, this might disrupt my sleep.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:01.860]   But in fact, it didn't.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.080]   I came back, I showered, had a little bit of food,
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.420]   which normally I don't eat that late.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:06.660]   And I slept like a baby.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.800]   And I felt great the next day waking up at my normal time,
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.020]   which cues me to another important scientific fact
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.580]   that relates to protocol and protocol flexibility,
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.740]   which is something that I gleaned from a colleague of mine
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.840]   at Stanford School of Medicine
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.020]   who works in the sleep laboratory.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.060]   And I intend to have him as a guest on this podcast,
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:27.220]   which is that much of our subjective feelings of energy
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.300]   and wellbeing during the day have to do not just
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.600]   with how well and how much we slept the night before,
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   but how positively we view our previous day's experiences
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   and how positively we view our next day,
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.400]   and in fact, that same day, pursuits and experiences.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.380]   So in other words,
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.000]   how we feel about our previous day performance
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.600]   and how we feel about what we're about to embark on
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.140]   during our day can increase our energy.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.820]   And that might seem obvious to a number of you,
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.100]   but these days, as I and many others out there
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.040]   are talking so much about the importance of sleep,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.220]   which is, of course, essential,
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:06.560]   you do want to get great sleep as many nights of your life
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.480]   as you possibly can.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.480]   And if you don't sleep much for a given night,
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.180]   hopefully it's for reasons that you enjoy
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.140]   and positive things like a party or a wedding
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.880]   or use your imagination.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:15.760]   But it's also the case
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.560]   that when we successfully complete something
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.140]   that we told ourselves that we are going to do,
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.060]   we feel great about it.
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.100]   And that if it means that we sleep a little bit less
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:28.100]   or that we have to do our practice bout at 3 p.m. or 2 p.m.,
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.880]   a time of day when we're really ordinarily
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.800]   in the trough of attention
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.620]   and we have to use 20 different tools
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.040]   or one tool 20 different times
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.920]   in order to get through that bout of learning,
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.600]   the fact that we complete it
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.540]   leaves us with a feeling of accomplishment.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.000]   And I'm certain, although I don't know exactly which,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.240]   that there are neurochemicals and hormones that reflect that.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.360]   It's almost with certainty going to involve dopamine
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.040]   and other neurochemicals.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.640]   But the point is not to get reductionist about it.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.120]   The point is that, yes,
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.300]   heightened attention and focus occur naturally 30 minutes,
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.160]   three hours, and 11 hours after waking.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.600]   But the really important thing about all of this goal setting
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.780]   and pursuit is to do it, to get it done,
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:07.560]   to set the goal, to do it specifically,
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.680]   make it quantifiable when you're going to do it,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.480]   make it about verb states, and then simply do it.
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.700]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,

[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.120]   please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.120]   I do read all the comments.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.820]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.920]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:51.640]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.120]   Not on today's podcast,
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.500]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.920]   we discuss supplements.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.040]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.200]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.640]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.920]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.560]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.280]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.920]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.440]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.420]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman,
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.560]   and you can also receive 20% off.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.780]   Again, that's livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.780]   .com/huberman.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.960]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.760]   to our neural network newsletter,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.120]   our neural network newsletter
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.500]   is a completely zero cost monthly newsletter
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.080]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes,
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.840]   as well as protocols.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.400]   That is short PDFs describing, for instance,
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.940]   tools to improve sleep, tools to improve neuroplasticity.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.760]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.040]   various aspects of mental health.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.720]   Again, all completely zero cost.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.480]   And to sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.240]   go over to the menu in the corner,
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.400]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.780]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:56.700]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.120]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.100]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn,
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:04.680]   and Facebook, and at all of those places,
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.680]   I talk about science and science-related tools,
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.240]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.360]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.580]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:12.760]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.900]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.120]   Thank you for joining me today for our discussion
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.340]   about science-based protocols for how to best set
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.800]   and pursue and achieve your goals.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.040]   And I do want to wish you all the best of luck
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.360]   in setting, pursuing, and achieving your goals.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.560]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.360]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.940]   [upbeat music]
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.520]   (upbeat music)
