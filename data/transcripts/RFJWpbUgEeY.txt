[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Unfortunately, due to a fault on the original machine on which the following recording was made,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   there remain traces of an earlier recording and some background noise
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   which we've been unable to remove during digital restoration.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   However, we trust that this will not spoil your enjoyment of this message by Dr Lloyd-Jones,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   taken from the Book of Revelation.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Now that is, I think, a very important matter that we should have that division in our minds,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   so I'll repeat it again. 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 11, 12 to 14, 15 and 16, 17 to 19, 20 to 22.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And there, I think, I was able to establish there is an obvious parallelism.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   In other words, you get that repetition, as I've just reminded you,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   of those elements in the whole story of the Christian Church,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   from the first coming of Christ to the second coming.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Christ himself, with his people.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But his people undergo certain experiences, there are those who are against them,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and then you end in each section with the last or with the final judgment.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Very well. We can therefore lay it down that there is this parallelism,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   this repetition in a number of sections.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   But there are certain other facts which I want to put to your consideration
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   which support that contention and which help, therefore, to substantiate it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   There are certain other repetitions.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   For instance, you will find that the same time factors,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   the same figures, symbols representing time, are used in certain of the sections.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   In, for instance, the section 8 to 11 and the section 12 to 14.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   For instance, in chapter 11, the second verse, you have a reference to 42 months.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   In the third verse of the eleventh chapter, you have 1260 days,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   which is again, actually, 42 months.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But there are those figures.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Then in chapter 12, verse 6, you noticed in the reading, we had again 1260 days.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And in the fourth chapter, we have time, times, and half a time.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Again, you see a year, two years, and half a year, three and a half years again.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   42 months again, 1260 days again.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And in the fifth verse of the thirteenth chapter,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   there is likewise a mention of 42 months, three and a half years again,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and 1260 days once more.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Now, the same figures are used, the same duration is indicated,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   of what I suggest to you are the same events,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   so that there is a repetition, a parallelism.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   What has already been said in one form is being said again in a different form.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Surely, an important bit of evidence.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Then, another very striking bit of evidence,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and perhaps one of the most convincing of all, is this.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That if you read the account of the blowing of the trumpets in chapter 8,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and the pouring forth of the vials in chapter 16,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   you will find that the same things exactly are referred to.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You do this at your leisure.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Read chapters 8 and 9, which record what happens when the trumpets are blown,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and chapter 16, which records what happens when the vials are poured forth,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and you will find that they have reference to exactly the same thing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's the earth in the first trumpet, it's the earth in the first vial.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It is the sea in the second trumpet, it's the sea in the second vial.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It is the rivers and the fountains in the third trumpet,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and exactly the same in the third vial.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Then it is the sun in the fourth trumpet, and the fourth vial in the same way.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then it is the seat of the beast in the fifth trumpet,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   seat of the beast likewise, in the fifth vial.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And lastly, the river Euphrates in the sixth trumpet,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and the river Euphrates in the sixth vial.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Now that surely is something that ought to engage our attention at once.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Why the same thing?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Why is it the same things that are affected?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Now that, I say, is a very powerful argument to support this contention
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   that there is this principle of repetition or recapitulation or parallelism,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   whichever you like to call it,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that the book is a book in which the different sections seem to be concerning the same thing,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   but looked at in a slightly different way,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and in order to bring out a particular and a differing aspect of the truth.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Now there is a very good bit of evidence, and in the same way,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   you will find that there is reference to the battle,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   a great battle which is to be fought.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's called in the original, "The battle."
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You will find references to that in chapter 16, 12th verse,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   chapter 19, 19th verse, chapter 28th verse.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   The same battle, obviously, if you check these references,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   you will see exactly what I mean.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The same thing is being spoken of on the three occasions,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but in a different kind of setting.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   In other words, three times over, the story leads up to this same battle.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Now, I do trust that as a result of the evidence which I put before you last week,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   with this supporting and additional evidence this evening,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I am establishing in your minds this principle of repetition or of recapitulation or parallelism.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And of course, it's a very interesting thing to observe
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   that this is something which is not unusual in prophetic literature.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Let me give you one example to show you what I mean.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Take for instance the book of the prophet Daniel.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Now in the second chapter of Daniel's prophecy,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   you remember you have an account there of that great image
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   which is divided into different sections,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   the head and the trunk and so on, and the feet ending off with the toes.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Now, that picture has reference to precisely the same thing
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   as you read of in the seventh chapter of Daniel.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Now, everybody's agreed about that. Nobody disputes it at all.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Chapters two and seven of the book of the prophet Daniel
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   are obviously describing exactly the same great empire
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   with which the children of Israel were going to be concerned.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And everybody, I say, is agreed about it there.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But there are so many who accept it in the book of Daniel and can't see it here.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Now, why did Daniel do that?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Well, the answer is, of course, that though he is really saying the same thing,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   he says it in two different ways and he repeats it
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   because he's got additional things to bring in in chapter seven
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   over and above what he'd said in chapter two.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Now, that's very typical of the prophets.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   They all tend to do that.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   They kind of make a bold statement about a thing.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Then they'll come back to it and take it up,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   put it in slightly different terms, different symbols,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   and add to what they've already said.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The principle of repetition seems to be a characteristic of all prophetic writing.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Very well, then.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Now, there is what I would call a kind of general analysis of the book of Revelation.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   May I remind you again as to what I'm attempting to do in these discourses at the moment?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I am not proposing to take you through the book of Revelation in detail.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That would be a very inappropriate thing to do in a course of addresses on biblical doctrines.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   If I wanted to do that, well, I should announce a series of addresses
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   going right through the book of Revelation.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's not my purpose.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I'm simply concerned that we may have the general message of the book,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   especially in its relevance to this question that we're considering
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   of the time of the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So I'm trying to give a kind of outline of interpretation,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   leaving the details to be filled in.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Well, having gone so far, I propose next to make this statement.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That while it is clear in this way that the book is divided into several sections,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   which seem to be dealing with the same matter, the same events,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   it is equally clear that you can divide up the whole into two sections.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In other words, the several sections can be grouped, again, into two big divisions.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And the dividing point, of course, is the end of chapter 11 and the beginning of chapter 12.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So that I suggest to you that you can think of the book in this way.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   The first big section, consisting of chapters 1, 2, and 3,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   chapter 4 to 7, chapter 8 to 11.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Three of our seven sections go into the first big section.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Then you've got your second big section, consisting of our four subsidiary sections,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   12 to 14, 15 and 16, 17 to 19, 20 to 22.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Now, why do I say this?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, I say this because it seems to me that the book of Revelation itself insists upon our saying it.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And for this reason, take this 12th chapter, which we read together just now.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Is it not perfectly clear that that chapter takes us back to the beginning of the Christian era?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It takes us back to the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   the one who is described here as a man-child who is brought forth.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   But you remember what we were told.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   That the devil had decided, even before he was born, that he would try to kill him the moment he was born.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And we remember, of course, from the Gospels, how he tried to do that through King Herod, etc.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Very well, then, here is the Lord Jesus Christ born, and the devil tries to kill him,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   but doesn't succeed at the beginning.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Then we are told that this man-child is taken up into heaven, caught up unto God and to his throne.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Surely, a perfect account of the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And in connection with that, you remember, we were told that there was war in heaven,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and that the devil was cast out.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil and Satan.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And you remember how our blessed Lord himself is recorded in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel as saying,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   "Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You see the correspondence, and it did happen at that time.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So that the death and resurrection of our Lord are accompanied by the casting out of Satan from heaven to the earth.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   As our Lord had said it would happen there in the twelfth of John.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Well, then you remember, the account goes on to say that the devil then turns his venom and his wrath upon the seed of the woman.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And the seed of the woman at this point is obviously none other than Christian people.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Those who belong to the son himself, the man-child whom she brought forth.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   The devil begins to persecute the church.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Now that is surely the reading of chapter twelve.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It gives an account thus of the incarnation, the devil's attempt, the death and resurrection,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and then the devil turning upon the Christian church, the Israel of God.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You remember we are told that the man-child is born of this woman.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   In other words, he did come of the seed of Abram and of the seed of David.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   He was born of Israel, the Israel of God.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And the church is now the Israel of God.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   He has come out of this Israel in order to redeem this Israel.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Born according to the flesh of the seed of Israel and of the seed of David and so on.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Very well.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Now I mention all that in order to show that it seems perfectly clear that the book takes us back again to the beginning in chapter twelve.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And therefore it suggests very strongly that there is this major division.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The first eleven chapters, the second eleven chapters.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   The dividing point being the beginning of chapter twelve.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Well now then ask someone, is there any difference in these two sections?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I suggest there is a very marked and a very striking difference.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And a most important one for us to observe from the standpoint of the interpretation of the book.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   What have you got in the first section?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Well in the first section you have got an account of the struggle of Christ himself and the church against men.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Against unbelieving men.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Against unbelievers.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   It is the great account of the struggle between Christ and his church and the world.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The world of men.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   That is the message of the first section.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But you see when you come on to the second section beginning at chapter twelve.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   What you have got here is not so much the struggle of Christ and his church against men, unbelieving men.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   What you have got here is the struggle of the Lord Jesus Christ and his church against the powers that are behind the world.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   The powers that are behind evil men.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The devil and all his assistants and associates.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You see he is not mentioned until this chapter twelve.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   He is there of course behind men but we are not told that until you come to chapter twelve.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Now this therefore is surely a most important point.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   In this chapter twelve we are given the beginning of this struggle.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   The devil first of all turns all his power against the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   The gospels tell us all about that.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   How the devil tempted him in the wilderness, tempted him in the garden, came back to him having tried to kill him at the very beginning.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   But then as I say he turns himself against the church.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   So that this second section therefore is really taking us over the same history as the first section.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Only that it shows us the struggle at a deeper level.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It is the same struggle but in the first section we are only seeing it in terms of men.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   In the second section we are seeing it in terms of the principalities and powers.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   The rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And how important it is that the Christian church should understand this.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   We all of us know something about persecution.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   We all of us know what it is to be confronted by people who are unbelievers, anti-Christian.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And how difficult they can make life for us at times.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Yes we know all that but that is not the whole story.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   We need to be enlightened to the fact that these men and women, these persons, these individuals, these human beings.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Are but being used as the instruments of great powers behind it all.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   You see the Bible so impresses this truth upon us.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   That it is the devil who is fighting God. That is the ultimate of it all.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   And our trouble is so often that we fail to remember that.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And therefore we become confused and we can't understand things.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   What you and I see with our naked eyes is simply the visible part of a great spiritual war.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   That is going on as it were in another realm and simply using us as it were almost as its instruments.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   So that in a very interesting way therefore we find that in this book of Revelation.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   We are given the surface picture and the deeper picture.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It's the same thing, it's the same history.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   That's why you get your recapitulation, your repetition.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   That's where you get your parallelism.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   But you see it here on the surface in the first section, beneath the surface with this mighty background in the second section.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Now if you look at it like that I think you'll see at once that there is no more important book for us in the whole of the Bible than the book of Revelation.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   What's its theme? Well its great theme is this.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It is concerned to unfold to us the great struggle between the Lord Jesus Christ and his church and his people.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   With these powers headed up by the devil himself and his instruments and associates whom he is using against us.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But thank God the book doesn't present itself to us merely in order to give us that picture.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Its ultimate object is to show us the final triumph of the Lord Jesus Christ and his people.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And that is why you see it does that in every single section.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It doesn't want us to wait until the end for the victory.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   In every single section you are led on to the victory.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   You are told yes this is going to happen to you but it's alright.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   He is with you and you are going to triumph and prevail.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Its purpose I say is to unfold to us the glory of the triumph that is certain to be ours.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And the assurance that even in the meantime, though the world may treat us very cruelly and though it may even kill us.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   It can never separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   So that this book you see is a book which in its own pictorial dramatic manner tells us exactly the same thing as the apostle Paul is saying in the 8th chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's the same message.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   The same message which you get in all the scriptures.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And you see the book of Revelation is no longer a book merely for some people who are going to be here on earth after the saints have been suddenly raptured.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   It's a book which speaks to us and our present condition.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   It has spoken to all ages of the church because they've all had to go through these things.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And thus it becomes a living and a real and a spiritual book.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And then you see if you go back and read it again in the light of all this, you'll find you'll understand it in an entirely new way.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Because it not only tells you what's going to happen, it tells you what you've got to do to overcome.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It warns you what's going to happen to you if you don't obey it and if you don't carry out its precepts.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   So that it's no longer a sort of jigsaw puzzle about times and seasons and dates and enables you to talk cleverly about political events and so on and so forth.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   No, it's a spiritual book that speaks to your heart, to your experience and that helps you to live from day to day.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   It's got warning, it's got instruction as well as its consolation.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And thus it becomes one of the most practical and day to day vital books in the whole canon of Holy Scripture.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Well now then, there is, I suggest to you, a general statement concerning the analysis of this book.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And in a sense, I was tempted to leave it at that and to leave you to work out the details for yourselves.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But let me go a little bit further.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Let me try to suggest to you some other broad headings which may be of value in the detailed interpretation.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Take that first section now in the light of all this.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Chapters 1 to 3.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   What have you there? Well, you've got there a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ among the churches.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ with his people.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Well, what are these seven churches?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Are they just seven particular churches that were in existence then?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Or are there, some would have us believe, descriptions of the general state of the church in different eras and periods and epochs in a chronological sense?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I suggest to you that they're not.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   But that seven again is the perfect number that is used to give us an account of the whole state of the Christian church.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   In other words, I'm suggesting to you that if you read your church history, you will find in the church universal on earth,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   the churches, conditions amongst Christian people corresponding to what is described in the letters to the seven churches.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's true today.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   There are churches today like the church at Ephesus.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   There are churches today like the church at Smyrna.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And all the rest of them, Philadelphia, Laodicea, and all the rest.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   They're always present.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   There are always pictures to be found in the church at any time corresponding to what you read in the seven churches.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And that is why you see the letters to the seven churches are always up to date.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I will go further.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I am quite certain that in this congregation at this moment, there are people who correspond to what you read in the description of the seven churches.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   In all these different states and conditions, you always find them.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   They're always there.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's a picture of the state of the church from the first coming to the second coming.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Laodicea is not the condition of the church only at the end before our Lord comes.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Surely before the Protestant Reformation, you had Laodicea to perfection.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And you've had it in the Protestant church many times since.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   The church in this country before the evangelical awakening of 200 years ago was typical Laodicea.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And it seems to me to be monstrous to suggest that the Laodicean state of the church is only now being entered into.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   It's been there from the very beginning and to be seen at any time.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And the same is true of all the other descriptions of life in the churches.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Well, very well, there is in essence the first section.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And you see, start with that and the details will be easily worked out.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   What about the next section, chapters 4 to 7?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Well, you remember this starts off with those two great and glorious chapters, 4 and 5.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Where we are given the great scene in heaven.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Where we are given some dim picture of the glory and the might and the majesty and the greatness and the holiness of God.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And then this great question of history arises.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   This book with the seals and nobody strong enough to take off the seals.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's all right, John is told when he begins to weep because he couldn't see anybody big enough and great enough.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   An angel tells him it's all right.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And John looks for this lion to appear and what does he see?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   A lamb as it had been slain.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Yes, it's the crucified Lord who is risen, who is the conqueror, who is the great king eternal.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And he, because of what he's done, has become the Lord of history.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   As Paul tells us in the second chapter of Philippians, because he humbled himself even to the death of the cross.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Wherefore God hath highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every other name.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   You've got it at the end of the 28th chapter of Matthew.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   He is in control, "Lo, I am with you even unto the end.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   All power has been given unto me."
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   It's the risen glorified Lord.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   There he is in chapter 5.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   In other words, we are told that he is the Lord of history.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He controls history.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   He is the master of history.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And I know of nothing more consoling.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And that's what makes this book of Revelation so wonderful.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Before it begins to tell you of the things that are going to happen to you as a Christian,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   it starts by reminding you that your Lord is on the throne.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   That he is the master and that he is reigning until all his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   The people to whom John wrote the book were told that and they needed to be told it.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   They were living and were being persecuted by the Jews at one time.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Now the persecution by the Roman Empire had started.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   They were going through terrible things.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And you think John simply wrote to tell them of something that might happen after 2,000 years had passed?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   How would that help them?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   It would almost be to mock them.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   No, no.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   John's writing to tell them what was already happening.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   But he tells them, "Your Lord is there and he's in control of history."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Well, now, then, having been told that, what does he go on to say?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Well, something like this.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   He brings us now in chapter 5 to the opening of the seal.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And in the first seal you see a rider on a white horse with a sword.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Who is he?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Well, I--as for the reason I've already given you, I can't stay to argue it tonight, though I could argue it and give reasons.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   I suggest to you that this is none other than the same person who is described in the same way in the 19th chapter of this same book.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   He is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   He is the rider on the white horse, and that's why it is a white horse.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   He sets out, as it were, with the gospel.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   He sends out his word.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And what follows?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Well, he's already told us himself what to expect when he sends out his word.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   You remember how he put it?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   He said, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I came not to bring peace, but a sword."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   What's he going to do?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   He's going to send a man at variance with his father and the daughter with her mother and all the rest of it.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   You'll find it in the 10th chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   He prophesied that the effect of his coming was going to be division.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   He comes with a sword, you see, on his white horse.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Yes, and he's followed, therefore, by the second horse.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And here is again another sword.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   What does this mean?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   This is a picture, this red horse, of the way in which Christian people, because they're Christian, are persecuted.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Yes, even slaughtered.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Killed.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It seems that the word in the Greek here carries the idea of slaughtering.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   It's a short sword. It's a broad sword.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   It means a personal, direct attack.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It isn't referring to a great big general war.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It refers to persecution of the saints, even unto death.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And hasn't that followed?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Didn't it happen to the Christians in the early centuries?
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Were they not butchered and massacred and murdered simply because they were Christians?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   No other reason.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Our Lord has told them here that it was going to happen to them.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   The rider on the red horse follows the rider on the white horse.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   That's the order.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   The word goes out, then comes the opposition.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   "Yea," says Paul in a word to his young follower and disciple Timothy,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   "Yea, and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Some of them will even think they're doing God's service when they put you to death, says our Lord, in another place.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Well, there it is. The red horse follows the white horse.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   What about the next?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   The next, you notice, is not a picture of famine, as some interpreters would have us believe,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   but it is a very vivid picture of suffering as a result of poverty.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   There is wheat and there is wine and oil, yes, but only the rich people can afford it.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And Christians were very poor people.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Most of them were slaves at the beginning.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   They were poor people and they've been poor generally ever since for this reason,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   that because they're Christians, they've had to suffer in this world.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Many of them lost employment because they wouldn't say that Caesar is Lord.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   "Not many wise, not many noble are called," says the apostle.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   No, no, it began amongst the slaves and the poor, and when difficulties arose,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   they hadn't the money to pay for the wine and the oil.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   The others had the money and therefore they could buy it.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It isn't famine, but it does suggest shortage and poverty.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And if you read the long history of the Christian church, you'll find that it has so often been true.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Then the next picture, of course, is a picture which is that of war leading to death.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Now, it isn't persecution so much now as literal war, warfare, sometimes religious war.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   The great clashes and the Christians are involved in it.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   You see, all these seals are an account of what happens to Christian people.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   They are descriptions of the suffering of the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Those who receive this word that he sent out, and they're involved in these wars.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   So that you go on to the fifth seal, and there you're given a picture of certain souls under an altar
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   crying out, "How long, O Lord?" You see, it's very natural.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   The Christian people who've been described as suffering in the way I've just been indicated to you,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   they cry out and say, "How long is this to continue?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   How long are you going to allow these enemies to do this to your people?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   How inevitable it is, how naturally it follows." That's the fifth, therefore.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Then, thank God, we go on to the sixth seal where we are given a great and dramatic picture
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   of judgment upon these terrible powers that are opposing Christ and his people.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   We read about the sun becoming black as sackcloth, often used in prophecy as a picture of judgment,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and the moon becoming as blood, and the stars of heaven falling.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   This is just a dramatic way to describe a great, cataclysmic judgment.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "And the heaven departed as a scroll as it is rolled together,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Listen to this then.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   "And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and to the rocks,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   'What will this fall on us and hide us from?'
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Amazing answer.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   'Hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?'"
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   You see, we've been given a picture of what happens to God's people
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   throughout the whole of the Christian era, leading up to that final judgment.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Now then, that's the meaning of the message of the seals.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   But I would remind you that we are given also that glorious statement in chapter 7,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   which is still a part of this particular section, you remember.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Here we are given this wonderful assurance
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   that all these great and mighty and terrible things are going to happen.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   God knows His own.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Before the seventh seal was broken, we read this,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   "And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   holding the four winds of the earth,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   saying that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, 'This is the promise.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   for we have sealed the servants of our God in their forests.'"
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   That's a description of the Christian.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   In other words, before these last judgments are going to come upon the world,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   God's people are to be put safe.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   A seal is to be put on their forests.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   How many are there?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Well, you're told that there were 144,000.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And I heard the number of them which were sealed.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   But you say, well, then that's Israel.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   After all, it isn't Christian people.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Surely, my friends, I need scarcely remind you again that this is a book of symbols.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And lest somebody may think that it is a description of literal Israel,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   listen to what you read in the ninth verse of this same seventh chapter.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   "After this I beheld and lo, a great multitude which no man could number,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   stood before the throne and before the Lamb,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   clothed with white robes, with palms in their hands."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   In other words, it's a symbolical figure.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   To suggest that it means 144,000 Jews is really almost to make the thing ridiculous.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   What is it? What is this 144,000?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Well, if you take the customary meaning attached to biblical symbols, you'll find this.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   The number three stands for the Trinity, God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Four, the four beasts, for instance, represents the whole earth of mankind.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   You multiply three by four, what do you get?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Well, you get God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit concerned about the whole world.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   There's your twelve.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But they were concerned about the old world, the twelve tribes of Israel.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You see, you've got twelve in the Old Testament.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   You've got twelve apostles in the New Testament.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And you have twelve twelves, and that comes to 144.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   But it's 144,000. What's a thousand?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Well, a thousand is ten cubed.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Ten is a number of completion, always in the structure.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Ten means a complete number.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   You work through this book of Revelation and keep your eye on the figure ten,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   and you'll find it's always meant to represent a whole, a completion.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Ten cubed is perfect, absolute completion.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   So I suggest to you that 144,000 means just that.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   It means the saving work of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   The saints of the Old Testament, the saints of the New Testament, the New Testament era,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   all of them brought together and absolutely perfect and complete.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Chapter 7, in other words, is a description of all the glorified spirits in heaven.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Whether they were Jews or Gentiles, it matters not what nation or kingdom or language or tribe they've come out of.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   They're Christ's people, and they're all safe.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And they are all with him and shall spend their eternity in his holy presence.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Well, we've got to leave it at that point.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Our time is gone.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   But thus I'm trying to show you in detail how these big principles that I've indicated to you can be worked out.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And God willing, we will continue with this next Friday evening.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
