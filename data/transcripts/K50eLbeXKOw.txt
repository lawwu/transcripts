[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.660]   where we finally got some stock market questions this week.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.780]   Remember, our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.600]   Duncan, when I was growing up,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.640]   you basically had two choices when it came to fashion.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640]   One, you could be comfortable and look like a slob,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.500]   or two, you could look nice, but be totally uncomfortable.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.260]   I feel like sometime in the last 10 to 15 years,
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.540]   that's changed.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.180]   Today's show is sponsored by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.340]   No one cared about making clothes
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.620]   that had both in the past, right?
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340]   Stretchy, breathable materials that also look nice.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.720]   I feel like it's a huge leap forward.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.260]   Bird Dogs has these new polos.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.380]   I got one on under here.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.620]   See, look, Bird Dog.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.900]   It's comfy. - Nice.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.500]   - It's the stretch material, just like those shorts.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300]   It looks nice, but it's also very comfortable.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.540]   I think it's one of the biggest innovations this century
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.020]   besides the skip intro button on streaming services.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.940]   And it's the same thing across their polos,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.660]   their shorts, their pants, joggers.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.100]   I've been wearing the joggers a ton lately.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.060]   Every weekend, I'm going to flag football games
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.220]   and soccer games, and I have to move around
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.220]   and stand around a lot, and I wanna be comfortable.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700]   I wanna look okay, though, so I wear my Bird Dog joggers.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.400]   Remember, we still have the Tech Dad hat here.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.300]   Sorry, Duncan, this is yours.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.020]   I still owe it to you.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.860]   - One day.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.340]   - BirdDogs.com/ATC, or enter the promo code ATC,
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.900]   and you get this free hat.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.720]   It's great.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   Stock up now.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.780]   - Sounds like a good deal to me.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.940]   - BirdDogs.com.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.140]   All right, last week--
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.580]   - Wait, should we make sure we're alive?
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.400]   I'm just kidding.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.240]   We're alive.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.820]   - It's always hit or miss here.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.000]   Last week, there was a lot of discussion
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.260]   on the person who wrote in and said,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.420]   "Hey, I make 50K.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.700]   "I live with my partner in California, in Los Angeles,
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.420]   "and I save $500 a month."
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.700]   And a ton of people responded.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.540]   I put this out on Twitter.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.140]   What do people think?
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.820]   And a lot of people said, "Hey, this is a great question."
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300]   But there's also the usual contingent of,
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300]   in this economy, what about inflation and government debt?
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.120]   And what's the point?
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.960]   You'll never save enough.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.100]   - What if annual inflation's 11%?
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.140]   - Yeah, and all these things.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.720]   And my whole point is that just,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.700]   when thinking about your finances or your career
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.620]   or anything like this, any type of advice,
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.540]   just ignore the defeatist attitude people.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.580]   I hate those people, right?
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.500]   Those people are never going to be helpful.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.700]   They're not helpful.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.020]   So, I mean, if they're right, what's the point anyway
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.840]   of planning, right?
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   That's their whole idea.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.060]   So, I don't know.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.420]   I think you can safely ignore these people
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.540]   that have the defeatist attitude.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.380]   Like, "Well, you're lucky to have a job.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.340]   "You should, you know,
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860]   "how can you do anything in this economy?
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.700]   "And what about this?
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.520]   "And what about that?"
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.360]   And people who are always looking
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.080]   for the cynical downside of things,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.100]   those people are not helpful.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.460]   I say safely ignore them.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.300]   That's why you come to us.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.920]   Glasses half full, optimistic.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.180]   We're not here to be cynics.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.020]   Let's go.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.020]   First question.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.420]   - Okay.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.700]   Up first today, we have a tweet that came in.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.620]   And so, you posted S&P 500 returns 2020 to 2021,
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.620]   up 52%, 2022 to now, down 7%.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.180]   You don't get one without the other.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940]   And then Brent responds,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.380]   "I began investing in S&P index fund in summer of '21.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.860]   "Is that unfortunate, good, or bad timing?"
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.060]   - All right.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.060]   Good question for a young person.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.700]   I think intuitively you want to see,
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.340]   when you put money in, you want things to go up, right?
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.660]   You want to make money.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.340]   It makes you feel good.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.540]   If you're just starting out though,
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.900]   it should be the opposite.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.020]   So from 1928 to 2022, S&P 500 achieved
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.360]   annual returns of 9.6%.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.060]   We can round up to 10% if we want to be,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.920]   you know, fudged a little bit.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.500]   But we all know that the stock market
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.860]   does not simply offer nine to 10% annual returns
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800]   year in and year out, right?
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.420]   Any given year in the stock market
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.980]   is anything but average.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.820]   In fact, if we just look at what happens
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.340]   in an average up year and an average down year,
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.160]   we can kind of figure this out.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.060]   So in an average up year, back to 1928,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.460]   there's an average gain of about 21%.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.300]   You with me, Duncan?
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.860]   So stocks go up, the average gain is like 21%.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.420]   The time stocks goes down,
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.960]   the average return is like a loss of 14%.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.840]   So the stock market is up roughly three out of every four
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.940]   years in that, right?
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.780]   You with me?
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780]   75% of the time it's up, and when it's up, it's up.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.420]   Let's round it down to 20, right?
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.260]   And when it's down, it's down, we'll say 15.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.660]   I like nice round numbers.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.340]   So let's say if you're in an average world,
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.220]   which again, doesn't exist,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.040]   but for the sake of this example, let's just go with it.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.820]   So you'd have plus 20, plus 20, plus 20 down 15
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.780]   in some order, right?
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.020]   If things follow the average,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.280]   and that would give you around 10% per year.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.100]   I'm not saying that 10% is gonna stick with us going forward
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.620]   and I'm also not saying that you're gonna get a 20% up year
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.540]   every time it goes up and a 15% down year when it goes down.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.400]   Sake of example, disclosures out of the way, right?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.920]   But I think these numbers can be instructive
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.420]   when thinking about it through your life cycle investing,
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.780]   especially when you're young and just starting out.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.220]   So let's say you're gonna save $1,000 a year
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.400]   for the next 40 years, right?
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.760]   And we'll use our same gain and loss numbers as before,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.600]   right?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.940]   When the market's up, it's up 20.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.460]   When it's down, it's down 15, right?
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.600]   And three out of every four years, it's gonna be up 20.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.460]   One out of every four years, it's gonna be down 15.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.520]   Now let's look at two scenarios
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.260]   and think about which would be better.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.340]   Your gains to be front loaded.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.700]   So you have 30 years of gains over 40 years
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.100]   or your losses are front loaded.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.860]   So you start with 10 years of down 15%, all right?
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.980]   So scenario A, John, throw it up here.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.940]   So let's say you get 10 years of down 15% in a row
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.780]   and then you get 30 years of up 20% in a row.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.980]   Your average return from this scenario is 10% per year,
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.860]   but I'm just moving things around, okay?
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.820]   All right, now let's look at scenario B, John.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.180]   This is you get 30 years in a row of 20% returns.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.300]   Again, you're putting in $1,000 a year for both scenarios.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.820]   Then you have 10 years at the end
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.100]   where you're losing 15% a year.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.940]   Again, 10% per year return.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.980]   The market itself is up 10% per year in either scenario.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.880]   I just shuffled around the order here, okay?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.300]   So a person who's saving periodically,
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.020]   which one should you choose, Duncan?
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.520]   A or B?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.740]   Would you rather have your losses up front
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.200]   or losses at the end and have a ton of gains up front?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.380]   - I'm gonna be honest, I was just in the chat
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.320]   and so I missed the last part.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.620]   - All right, I'm gonna tell you.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.820]   So you want this, so in scenario A,
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.340]   your returns are dreadful for the first 10 years, right?
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.900]   And then the ensuing 30 years, you have gains every year.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.140]   Saving $1,000 a year,
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.880]   your ending balance would be $2.5 million.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.300]   Pretty good, right?
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.660]   Scenario B, your returns were wonderful
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.020]   for the first 30 years, but dreadful for the final 10.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.840]   That $1,000 a year would be $200,000.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.940]   So we talk about a $2.3 million difference.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.420]   Again, the market has the same average return
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.860]   in each scenario.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.460]   But in scenario A, you're saving and investing
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.080]   in the most important compounding years of your life
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.440]   during a nasty crash, right?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.500]   And in scenario B, you're saving and investing
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.620]   in the most important years of your life
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.300]   during a rip-roaring bull market.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.900]   Obviously, these examples are not realistic.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.160]   If the stock market fell 15% per year for 10 years,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.420]   we're talking like an 80% crash,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.660]   and that's the Great Depression.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.580]   If you gain 20% for 30 years in a row,
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.620]   we're talking about a gain of nearly 2,400%.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.220]   So obviously, the stock market doesn't look like this.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.600]   There's more give and take.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   But the idea here is that you should want
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.740]   those poor returns front-loaded.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.460]   You want to be investing
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.160]   because you're going to be buying in at lower prices
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.700]   and buying more shares and at higher dividend yields
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.320]   and lower valuations and all these things when you're young.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.160]   When you're young,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.820]   you should not be wanting all-time highs.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.140]   If you're periodically saving out of your paycheck
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.580]   or saving on a monthly basis,
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.100]   you should want the stock market to fall.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.100]   You should get on your hands and knees
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.940]   and pray for bear markets and corrections and crashes.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.300]   These are good things for young people.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.140]   - That's what I've said before
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.540]   is I think too many people, including myself in the past,
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.620]   always thought about it from dollar terms.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.500]   Here's how much money I have in my account
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.540]   instead of looking at shares.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.960]   If you look at shares, then it feels a lot better, right?
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.460]   'Cause you are constantly accumulating more and more shares
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.300]   early on. - And especially if you're
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.120]   going to be a net saver.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.300]   - Yeah, yeah. - Right?
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.140]   Yes, exactly.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.620]   So John, throw up the chart here.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.980]   This is since August, 2021
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.740]   when this person started investing.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.340]   The stock market has essentially gone nowhere.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.980]   We're talking about it's down 2% or so in total.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.140]   And it fell for a while, it was up for a while.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.660]   If you've been diligently saving and investing
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.080]   in the stock market on a regular basis
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.560]   and index fund like this person has,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.380]   you've had the ability to slowly build up a position.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.780]   Right?
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.580]   Sometimes prices are higher, sometimes they're lower,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.700]   but it's essentially gone nowhere,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.140]   which is a good thing, right?
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.800]   So I think if you're just starting out,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.140]   the best thing that could happen to you
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.940]   is a series of down markets or sideways markets, whatever.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.660]   The thing is you can't promise
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.700]   which way the stock market's gonna go.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.160]   Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's timing.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.920]   The stock market's not gonna do what you need it to do
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   just because you want a certain outcome.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.640]   But most people think about it the wrong way.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.300]   They should be thinking that the stock market should be bad
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.140]   when I'm a saver.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.960]   That's a good thing.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.100]   And hopefully it's better later on.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.540]   So bad returns are not always a bad thing
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.420]   as long as they lead to better returns down the road.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.660]   That's the idea here.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.700]   - Also, going to cash or bonds early on in that scenario
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.500]   would completely negate what we're talking about.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.340]   So just--
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.780]   - Exactly, it's the market timing thing, right?
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.660]   And obviously, again, this is probably a different scenario
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.560]   for older investors who have the majority of their wealth
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.420]   already tied up into the stock market.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.660]   That's a different scenario.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.280]   But if you're someone who's young and periodically saving,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.700]   you want the returns to be poor.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.860]   You want bad outcomes now
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.980]   so they can be better in the future.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.020]   - Yeah, makes sense.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.300]   Buy it on sale. - All right, next question.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.500]   - Just not individual stocks.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.340]   - Well, yeah.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.340]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.180]   Up next.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.160]   - I mean, oldie goes down 15% every year for 10 years,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.000]   probably, right?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.260]   Is that what we're planning on?
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.440]   - That, yeah, that stock is not looking too hot,
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.380]   but I still have some.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.540]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Brian.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.220]   I want you to assume you could decide on the annual return
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.740]   for the S&P 500 for the next 20 years,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.500]   but you had to select the lowest return
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.980]   you would be content with.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.140]   What return would you choose and how would you decide?
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.820]   - All right, very philosophical here from Brian.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.900]   - I like this. - He may have had a gummy
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.420]   before asking this one, but I like it, right?
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.220]   Because I think philosophical questions like this,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.600]   although totally unrealistic,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.660]   just like my first example, it was unrealistic,
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.900]   but I think if it helps you get in the right frame of mind,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.320]   it can still be useful.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.260]   So especially thinking about things like risk and reward.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.060]   So John, do a chart on first.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.300]   Let's look at the historical track record
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   of the US stock market over 20 year periods.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.740]   This is going back to 1926.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.680]   I did rolling monthly returns.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.240]   These are annual averages.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.060]   So the average is a little more than 10% per year
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.060]   for over 20 year periods, which makes sense.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.260]   You can see that there's a wide range around the average.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.580]   The worst 20 year return, I have a gain of 1.9% per year.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.980]   And the highest one is 18.3% per year.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.860]   Of course, there's no, as usual, no taxes or costs
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.060]   or that sort of stuff taken out of this,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.620]   but this is just the market.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.740]   So even over longer time periods,
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.340]   there are risks involved with stocks, right?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.240]   Interesting enough though, 75% of the time,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.980]   going back to 1926, rolling returns have been eight,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.500]   over 20 year periods have been 8% or higher.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.220]   So like our three out of every four years,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.660]   the stock market is up.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.740]   Three out of every four 20 year periods,
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.540]   the stock market is up 8% or more.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.980]   Now, obviously there's a lot of those periods overlapping.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.180]   There haven't been that many 20 year periods.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.660]   If we broke them up, it might look a little different,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.900]   but initially I'd probably fall right around that 8% number,
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.260]   but there are obviously other considerations here, right?
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.460]   You have to think about it on a relative basis.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.920]   So the 20 year treasury right now yields 5.2%.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.880]   I think it hit yesterday, maybe a little higher,
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   maybe a little lower today.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.120]   That's a pretty good lock-in for 20 years, not bad.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.920]   20 year tips are yielding 2.6% real,
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.680]   meaning you get 2.6% per yield
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.880]   on top of whatever inflation is over the next 20 years.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.520]   So these are like your hurdle rates or your bogeys,
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   I think, as far as if you want to think about them
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.400]   in risk-free terms.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.440]   So that's a much higher hurdle rate
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.560]   than we've had over the past 20 years.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.360]   It also depends on what stage in life you're in.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.620]   Like I said, older people are different.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.440]   Retirees would probably take some sort of guarantee
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.400]   in the 6% to 7% range, I would imagine.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.640]   Like if I'm done saving and I'm investing in the portfolio
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.660]   as a thing that's driving most of my income
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.680]   besides Social Security or pension,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.320]   I'm sure a lot of retirees would say,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.640]   give me 6.5% or 7% all day long for the next 20 years.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.720]   Count it, I don't want to think about it.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.400]   Young people, you're probably better off
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.200]   rolling the dice and accepting volatility,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.160]   'cause again, like the first question,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.960]   it gives you the opportunity to buy in at lower prices
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.920]   and rebalance on occasion.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.260]   Duncan, you actually pulled our audience
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.460]   about this question yesterday.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.620]   John, just throw up the results here.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.460]   So what's the lowest--
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.460]   - Yeah, thanks to everyone who responds.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.660]   We always get thousands of people responding to me.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.500]   - Yeah, this is great.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.260]   On YouTube, we got over 2,300 people voted.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.100]   The lowest annual S&P 500 return
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.140]   you would be content with over the next 20 years.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.260]   It was actually more spaced out than I thought it would be.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.140]   About a quarter of people said 5% to 6%.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.940]   Again, if we could look at it by age,
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.300]   I'm guessing that's older people,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   'cause you can get 5% in a treasury right now for 20 years.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.700]   6% to 7% was around 1/5 of the people.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.280]   7% to 8% was a little more than a quarter.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.320]   And then over 8%, I guess it was around 30%.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   So a pretty even distribution.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.080]   And I don't know, it would be interesting
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.600]   to see these broken out by age, but--
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.500]   - I mean, you can get 4% or 5% in Beanie Babies, I think.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.080]   - But again, the treasury is the big thing here.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.740]   So yeah, I would have fallen in like the 7% to 8% range.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.200]   But the other problem with this exercise is,
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.160]   the funny thing is, if you did offer
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.320]   some sort of guarantee in the stock market, right?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.960]   Like you can get 8% per year in the stock market.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.600]   Our human nature, we would bid up the,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.420]   regardless, we would bid up the prices,
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.780]   so eventually prices got so high
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.900]   that returns in the future would be too low,
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.600]   which is kind of how the stock market works, right?
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   If you look at the actual fundamentals,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.720]   they don't move around nearly,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   like dividends and cash flows and earnings and revenue,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   they don't move around nearly as much
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.500]   as the stock market itself.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.080]   So even if this did exist, we'd probably mess it up somehow.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.440]   And obviously life would be much easier
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.080]   from a planning perspective if you could say,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.320]   hey, I'm getting 8% per year, year in and year out,
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.760]   and I'm just gonna bank on it.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.920]   It would be way easier to plan for retirement,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.840]   plan for 529 plans, all this stuff.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.880]   Alas, risk and reward are attached at the hip,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.080]   always and forever in the stock market, unfortunately.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.200]   So certainly a useful question in light of the move
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.400]   I think we've seen in long-term bonds recently,
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.080]   especially for retirees thinking about like,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.620]   do I take the guaranteed 5% for seven years
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.520]   or 10 years or whatever,
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.280]   or do I go for the juggler in the stock market
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.840]   and hopefully it's better?
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.680]   - I haven't seen many questions about munis recently.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.440]   Is there any reason people wouldn't be looking at munis?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   - Well, I think we've gotten questions
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   across the spectrum of yield, I think.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.880]   Munis and corporates and the high yield
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.700]   and all these things.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.480]   I think people are starting to get interested
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.860]   in all of them.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.000]   So we'll see, I bet we have a muni one or two
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.060]   we can look for.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.080]   Anyway, let's do another one.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   - Okay, up next.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.120]   - What was your answer?
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.760]   What would you pick?
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.640]   - I said 7%.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.480]   - Seven, okay.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.640]   - It's like what feels like I would want
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.520]   and need to be invested in the stock market.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.720]   - Okay, that's fair.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.000]   - I mean, I'd like, you know, 20, but.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.840]   - Yes.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.880]   - Okay, up next we have the following.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.460]   Hey guys, long time listener, first time emailer.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.480]   I'm in sales and landed two large accounts
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.200]   that will move me from 300,000 to over $450,000 a year.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.700]   That bumps my tax rate from 24% to 32%
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.320]   for a good deal of income.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.000]   Should I be optimizing for lowering my taxable income,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.160]   prioritizing things like traditional 401k over Roth
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.280]   and maxing out my 529s?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.200]   Are there programs similar to the calculators online
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.320]   that you can play out tax scenarios in the future?
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.080]   I think we're talking about like how you can look
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.440]   at your different portfolios,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.980]   but they're talking about for taxes.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.380]   I'd love to try and see the math of traditional
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.840]   versus Roth as your income and tax brackets change
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.000]   throughout your lifetime.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.160]   That sounds kind of cool.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.240]   - Yeah, we don't have a tax calculator here,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.640]   but we do have Mr. Bill Sweet.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.480]   That's close enough.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.360]   - Basically a tax calculator.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.320]   - He's a tax calculator, Bill.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   See, tax GPT.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.980]   Bill, I told you before the show started,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'm impressed with how many people email us in
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.360]   and know their tax bracket,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.080]   because I don't know how many people in America
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.760]   could actually tell us what their tax bracket is.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.720]   Maybe 2%, and that might be too forgiving.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.360]   I don't really know what mine is
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.800]   until you tell me every year.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.520]   - Yeah, I'm the only one here in New York City
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.440]   for some reason today.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.080]   I think I'm gonna go on Fifth Avenue
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.520]   and take an impromptu poll when this show closes.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.680]   Do you wanna do it live?
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.200]   You guys wanna come with me?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.320]   I'm not actually gonna do that.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.140]   - Let's not do that.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.840]   - I don't see like a Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel show
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.080]   from that ever coming about,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.920]   because I don't think people care about their tax rates.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.840]   - Who's the dude that like runs up and like just like,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680]   what's that guy's name?
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   - Oh, it's Billy on the Street.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.360]   That could be you. - Billy on the Street.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.180]   Yeah, we could do that. - That's you.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.440]   - Bill on the Street, tax GPT on the street.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.280]   Anyway, let's get to Brian's question.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.480]   Also, this is a not to brag.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.320]   Good for you, Brian.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.000]   He made some sales, got a huge jump in income.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.600]   - My guy's making a half million dollars a year.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.280]   I mean, that's gonna solve a lot of problems.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.840]   But I love the thinking, which is like,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.080]   cool, I've got this big raise.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.000]   What am I gonna do tax-wise?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.720]   So let's go back to the start.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.060]   As we've discussed many times in the show,
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.920]   in a 401(k) plan, you have a choice to make
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.840]   on your contributions.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.140]   And this year you can fund up to 22,500 per year,
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.840]   which is a big number.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.680]   And that can go either into a traditional bucket
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.400]   and you get a tax deduction upfront for that,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.320]   but you'd have to pay the full tax later, or Roth.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.600]   And if you go Roth, you're gonna pay the tax now,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.360]   but you get tax-free distributions later.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.800]   I think at a half million dollars, as Brian indicates,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.840]   that jump from 24 to 32% is where I would shift from Roth
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   and go traditional there.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.340]   - That's kind of like your cutoff, right?
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.180]   - For me, that's it.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.000]   And we've discussed this in the past,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.440]   but there's really two reasons, Ben,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.880]   why the cutoff is there.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.760]   So reason number one is it's the second biggest jump
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.540]   in the U.S. tax code.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.040]   You go from 10 to 12, not a big deal, right?
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.440]   Then you go from 12 to 22, that's a big one.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.040]   That happens about $118,000 a year.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.120]   The next biggest jump is 24 to 32,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.400]   right where Brian's looking at.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.800]   And that happens at about $390,000 a year.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.220]   And so Brian's marginal tax rate at 450, 500K,
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.360]   every dollar he puts into traditional 401K
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.580]   is gonna reduce his taxable income
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.560]   at that 32% tax bracket.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.760]   And that's why I think that that leap is relatively big.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.780]   Brian's right there,
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.380]   and that's where I'd make that shift.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.680]   Very, very important. - Yeah.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.520]   That makes sense.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.980]   Any other considerations in terms of trying to figure out
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.860]   a way to do a SEP or a solo 401K?
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.300]   - Yeah, so, well, let me skip forward to the other,
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.540]   or skip back a second, Ben.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.860]   The other big consideration is in our work,
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.980]   and this is based on our clientele,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.340]   which are relatively affluent, relatively wealthy
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.780]   in the scheme of humanity,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.780]   most of them are distributing assets in retirement
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.900]   at the 20 to 4%, 22% tax bracket, right?
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.740]   And so back to our point, if Brian's at 32 now,
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.300]   and we think he's probably gonna be at 24
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.540]   when he gets to retirement,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.740]   that arbitrage is right there looking at you in the face.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.780]   And so that, to me, is the second reason.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.940]   So your question was what?
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.740]   Are there opportunities for other--
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.820]   - Well, I just wanna make a point here that,
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.260]   see, to all the Roth haters out there,
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.780]   you don't always recommend a Roth, right?
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.700]   - I don't, I don't.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.340]   And it's almost like that was cued up, right,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.460]   to rescue me from my--
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.020]   - I'm just saying, is there anything else,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.860]   because this is a such,
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.780]   I mean, we're talking like a 50% jump in income here.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.140]   Obviously, there's gonna be more taxes paid,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.780]   but are there any other,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.340]   should we be looking at any other tax-deferred vehicles
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.860]   to set things aside to try to save some taxes?
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.020]   - Yeah, so I'm assuming that Brian's working for an employer
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.380]   and so 401(k) is off the table, right,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.420]   because he can't direct his own SEP IRA too.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.180]   It's not his own business that he's directing.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.680]   401(k) is the easiest opportunity.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.400]   I think HSA is the other one, Ben, that commonly comes up.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.460]   It's gonna come up here in question two.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.300]   Those are the big ones.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.220]   But no, I mean, unfortunately, you're really limited.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.420]   I mean, you can look at charitable,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.420]   but in order to deduct a charitable
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.020]   at a married filing tax, married filing joint,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.420]   you have to give like 30 grand, right?
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.660]   So that's a wonderful thing to do.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.300]   I'm not saying don't, but it's a big lift, right?
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.900]   - Like no one's gonna feel sorry
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.700]   for someone making a half a million dollars a year,
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.820]   but when you're making that much,
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.020]   the traditional $6,000 limit or whatever
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.180]   on a traditional IRA and trying to do a backdoor,
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.700]   it almost doesn't seem,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.180]   it's such a drop in the bucket at that point.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.340]   - It is, it is, but the way to win the tax game
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.460]   is improve at the margins.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.580]   Like you're not gonna give a big swing.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.180]   No, you're not gonna cut your taxable income in half.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.980]   - Okay, I guess that's the point, right?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.540]   You know, there's only so many levers you can pull.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.580]   - It's really winning the game.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.100]   And fortunately, if you're earning a half million dollars
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.060]   from your job, like, yeah, you're gonna pay a lot of tax.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.620]   So ultimately the small things do add up, Ben.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.500]   But the second half of Brian's question was,
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.540]   is there a tax planning software out there
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.500]   where I can look at this?
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.380]   And like we use, Ben, as you know, in our practice,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.580]   we use a combination.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.820]   We use Orion Planning, we use eMoney,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.260]   and we have a relationship with MoneyGuide.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.180]   And each of those software platforms
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.580]   have different pros and cons.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.740]   And unfortunately, none of them
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.860]   are offered to the retail investor.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.540]   There are a couple of options that are out there
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.060]   that you could go Google.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.900]   But unfortunately, for me and Bill, Ben,
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.100]   this becomes such a complex topic.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.540]   We have not found that there's any real reliable software
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.780]   that can accurately forecast somebody's tax rate over time.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.540]   What me and Bill Archeronian, CPA,
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.540]   he's the CEO at Ardubam Tax.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.380]   What we end up doing
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.300]   is exporting financial plan data in Excel,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.940]   and we end up building tax projections
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.300]   customized for clients.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.940]   So unfortunately, I think that's the work of the CPA,
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.300]   and that's why you would pay somebody
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.380]   to kind of help there.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   There's not a lot that I think Brian can do
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.820]   outside of 401ks and things like that.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.900]   - Tax is not very scalable as a business.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.100]   - And it's not very scalable.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.340]   And so we just end up with these homemade, small batch,
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.220]   this artisan tax planning that we do for clients.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.380]   And for us, it's a big part of our value add.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.060]   It's why we think we can charge.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.140]   - My only other advice here would be,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.100]   I'm okay when you're making that much more money,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.500]   I'm okay with some lifestyle creep
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.900]   as long as you have savings rate creep.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.980]   So if you were saving 20% of your income at 300,
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.580]   save 20% at 500 too.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.060]   So that way you are saving the same percentage of income,
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.300]   and you're also giving yourself a raise
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.140]   to spend a little more.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.540]   I'm fine if you're gonna do one, do the other.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.700]   - Yep, and there are limits to what you can contribute
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.860]   to IRAs, to 401ks, to tax qualified investment accounts.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.220]   There's no limit to what you contribute
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.380]   to a non-qualified account.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.420]   We have relationships with some really good firms
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.140]   that do tax loss harvesting,
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.220]   direct indexing through our Shaughnessy Canvas.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.740]   There are ways to solve this problem
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.340]   that are not just retirement accounts,
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.060]   and I'd urge somebody making a half million dollars
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.980]   to you to consider that.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.700]   - Yeah, you're gonna be saving more in a taxable account.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.540]   - Amen.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.020]   - And if you need any help with tax loss harvesting,
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.460]   I can always provide.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.260]   - We've got the market, Duncan's got the market cornered.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.460]   - Yeah, I know how to get you there.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.900]   - A great, great way to save on taxes is to lose money.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.060]   It's very easy.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.900]   - Yeah. - All right.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.540]   Someone says savings rate creep is a new compound shirt.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.380]   I like it.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.340]   - Yep, yep, do not recommend losing money in the market.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.580]   - You just gotta be careful with that
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.900]   because it could be like on a savings rate and a creep.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.940]   - Yeah. - You want both of those.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.420]   - We could do like a Halloween themed one,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   like some creepy character or something.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.140]   - Great radio hit song though, come on.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.620]   - Also on the Always Sunny podcast,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.900]   that's what they call viewers of the podcast.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.020]   - Creeps. - Creeps?
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.860]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.700]   - Didn't know that.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.380]   - All right, next one.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.500]   - Okay, up next we have,
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.380]   I'm 38 years old and a newish dentist.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.020]   I make about $400,000 a year
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.860]   and recently started investing in stocks.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.660]   Maxed out my 2022 and 2023 Backdoor Roth IRA
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.660]   as well as my HSA account.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.460]   Since I'm already in a higher tax bracket,
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.380]   I've been thinking it would be better
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.900]   if I do a SEP IRA instead of Roth
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.580]   to save more on my reported income and taxes.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.160]   Also thinking about starting my solo 401k.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.500]   I know I'm older and kind of late to the investing game
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.620]   and that's why I'm trying to invest the most
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.800]   and save the most on taxes.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.180]   I would really appreciate your professional opinion on this.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.020]   - Okay, so this stuff with someone who becomes a dentist
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.860]   or a doctor is interesting
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.620]   because they spend so much time in school
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.620]   and then even when they start working,
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.420]   like a doctor would be like a residency,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.300]   you don't get paid as much
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.140]   and then all of a sudden it kicks in
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.660]   and your higher salary kicks in
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.780]   but you feel like you're a little late in the game.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.220]   This is also where probably lifestyle creep is.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.740]   So this person is thinking about it the right way.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.100]   They make a higher salary.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.340]   They want to make up for some lost time.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.180]   They probably have some student loans, I would guess.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.780]   - Probably typically in the hundreds of thousands
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.220]   of student loan debt, right?
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.980]   - Yes, obviously a good investment though
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.220]   for the type of salary you're making
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.020]   but also they want to catch up.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.340]   So I know a lot of dentists are business owners, right?
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.820]   So they probably have this,
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.660]   they can do the solo 401(k) thing.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.540]   So that's probably a good place to start, right?
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.660]   If they want to have the tax deferred income.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.860]   - Absolutely, so Pizad, congratulations.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.220]   Thank you for getting work done
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.780]   out there in the mountains of America.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.860]   But I guess Pizad says,
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.980]   "Hey, should I do a SEP IRA instead of a Roth IRA?"
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.660]   Great news, you can do both.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.500]   - Both, right?
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.580]   - Yeah, the SEP IRA limits
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.340]   because they're tied to a retirement plan
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.260]   are totally different and separate
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.820]   from your Roth IRA traditional IRA limits.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.180]   And not only that, but they're 10 times as large.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.700]   Duncan, John, me, Nicole, Ben,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.300]   we can each contribute $6,500
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.940]   to a traditional or Roth IRA.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.580]   Pizad's doing the right thing, backdoor Roth.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.700]   I would keep that up.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.260]   A SEP IRA has a limit this year of $66,000, right?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.740]   $66,000 or 20% of your income,
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.060]   whichever is lower. - Hey, these limits
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.100]   make no sense to me and they never have.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.900]   Why is that so big and IRA is so small
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.560]   and then the 401(k) is, why?
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.580]   Why are they so different? - I do not know.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.180]   I do not know, probably we'd have to go back
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   to dig up the ghost of Ronald Reagan
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.720]   and find out what happened to the tax reform code in 1986.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.260]   But no, I think it's just a case
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.740]   of been summer inflation adjusted
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.660]   and higher numbers and businesses
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.340]   tend to have higher limits, right?
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.220]   Because of a myriad of reasons.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.380]   But Pizad also asks, "Hey, should I do a solo 401(k)?"
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.860]   For his amount of income,
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.820]   the contribution limits are gonna be the same,
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.300]   whether it's $66,000, it's gonna be the exact same
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.180]   SEP IRA versus 401(k).
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.420]   So I don't know that you get necessarily a benefit
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.380]   from a solo 401(k) at his amount of income
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.460]   'cause it's gonna be limited
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.380]   to 20% of his income either way.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.220]   So the only thing I caution him on
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.300]   is if you have a dental practice,
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.700]   I'm assuming you're not working totally by yourself.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.820]   Typically there's dental assistants, there's staff,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.660]   whatever you're doing
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.420]   for your own profit sharing contribution,
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.460]   you would have to do as well for your employees too.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.700]   And so it's not just you, unless you're a consultant,
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.540]   you're working for a big,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.700]   like if you actually are actually on your own.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.980]   So I'd be careful there.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.300]   But Ben, Pizad mentions he's 38, right?
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.420]   And he feels like he missed the boat.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.100]   I take the opposite side of that.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.340]   38 to me feels like a young man in my mid 40s.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.260]   And if you're 38, you still have 30 years of compounding
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.660]   before you hit 68, right?
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.540]   Where you probably are gonna retire.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.580]   And $66,000 saved today,
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.220]   assuming you get a 7% compounded rate of return,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.580]   is gonna turn to $132,000 in 10 years,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.340]   $264,000 in 20 years, and $528,000 in 30 years.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.620]   You are not too late, Pizad.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.900]   - And he's making mid six figures already,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.940]   probably gonna make more as his career goes on
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.660]   and more people's teeth get bad.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.300]   - Our guy Brian, he's winning the game,
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.380]   making a half million dollars a year in this economy.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.500]   - Yeah, at that age,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.380]   you're definitely not too late to get started.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.300]   - And the SEP component means
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.180]   they own their own business, correct?
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.580]   - Yeah, more than likely.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.260]   So they're tying it to their practice.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.780]   So yeah, I'm presuming he owns a dental practice.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.860]   But again, Ben Duncan, as you know,
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.620]   we take care of our Ridholds Wealth employees.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.180]   Your contribution rate is matched like anybody else.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.420]   You gotta take care of your employees too.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.060]   And that's not just like a suggestion,
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.380]   that's also actually the law.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.620]   So whatever you're contributing for your business
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.540]   to yourself, you need to match your employees too.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.740]   - Okay, and just to clarify,
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.220]   so there's three different kinds of IRAs,
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.100]   there's Roth, traditional, and a SEP?
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   - Oh, we can throw out some simples.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.900]   We can throw out rollovers, yeah.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.300]   There's a suite of IRAs that we could talk about.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.620]   - And we have the 401(k), traditional, Roth,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.220]   and the SEP, the individual 401(k),
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.260]   yeah, there's tons of stuff.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.780]   - And just to clarify for those that are new
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.180]   and young people that might not know this,
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.660]   for traditional and Roth, the cap is 6,500 combined.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.940]   - Correct, yep, this year.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.500]   This year, until our guy bazaar hits 50 and then it's 7,500.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.500]   Very great thing to do.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.220]   And again, good for you, congratulations.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.900]   - All right, one more question.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.540]   - All right, last but not least,
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.380]   we have a question from Mark.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.740]   If one is lucky enough to retire
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.300]   with a decent size net worth,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.780]   wouldn't it be more prudent to borrow against assets
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.420]   and pay interest versus taxes?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.980]   - All right, so securities-based line of credit,
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.100]   I guess we're talking about here.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.020]   I know this was huge when rates were really low.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.900]   And I know some of our clients could borrow
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.540]   against their portfolio at 2% maybe,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.860]   sometimes sub two, around 3% when rates were low.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.820]   Didn't this make more sense when margin loans were 3%?
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.900]   Now you're probably paying seven to 9%
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.220]   depending on the financial institution
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.580]   or how much money you have.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.940]   Like, how do you even think about calculating the break-even
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.700]   on that kind of hurdle rate?
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.980]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.700]   Yeah, and Ben, you skipped to the chase, right?
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.580]   That was gonna be my take-home point, right?
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.980]   That we could end the conversation with.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.100]   But as a concept, yeah.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.340]   S block or borrowing against a portfolio, it's a tool.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.740]   It's a tool that you could use.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.380]   And so there are pros.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.420]   Ben, let's list the pros.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.060]   Like borrowing against your assets,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.140]   that doesn't generate a taxable event, right?
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.860]   So if you have a large deferred gain on your Apple stock,
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.420]   if you have a property or your house or something else,
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.940]   yeah, tacking on an S block
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.940]   allows you to withdraw those funds
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.260]   and not realize to pay any taxes.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.980]   - And you're letting the money continue to compound.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.820]   - Correct.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.340]   And so let's just say hypothetically,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.700]   you get a half million dollar property.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.020]   You have $100,000 basis.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.100]   So you have a $400,000 capital gain.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.500]   If you were to liquidate that property at 15%,
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.860]   let's say some state taxes too,
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.140]   you pay about 80 grand in income tax, right?
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.500]   So pulling out an S block allows you to pull out
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.780]   up to usually 80% of your loan to value.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.860]   So $400,000 in your pocket tax-free.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.380]   So those are the pros.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.580]   However, the cons.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.060]   Con number one is most people get to retirement
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.060]   and their goal is then not to add debt, right?
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.980]   So I do like the thinking, right?
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.540]   The invert, let's invert this thinking.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.380]   Why not?
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.740]   But I guess the cons are that tax on gain can be deferred,
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.340]   but it really can't be avoided.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.380]   On a long enough timeline, you can defer, defer, defer.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.260]   On a long enough timeline, we're all dead, right?
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.940]   So it's not a terrible idea.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.380]   But Ben, you're exactly right.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.140]   If I'm borrowing at 8%, let's say,
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.460]   which is roughly the U.S. mortgage rate right now,
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.500]   $400,000 borrowing that amount of money
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.260]   is gonna cost you 30 grand a year.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.220]   And so for what you're paying to borrow that money,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.460]   you're probably paying a third of your tax bill each year.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.860]   And this is the kicker, Ben.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.820]   Again, you're just deferring the tax.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.180]   So if and when you spend out your S block,
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.060]   if and when you go to sell that property,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.180]   that 80 grand tax bill or more is still due,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.500]   but now you've borrowed against your proceeds.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.980]   And so you're not gonna have the net cashflow potentially
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.860]   to finance that tax.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.900]   My take would be, look, if you made it that far,
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.100]   it's something to consider,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.540]   talk it over with your financial planner,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.020]   talk it over with your tax people,
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.620]   but reducing your net worth on day one,
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.500]   maybe not a great idea,
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.300]   but compared to your other options.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.700]   Last quick point for me, Ben,
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.340]   you cannot borrow against your retirement assets.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   Thou shalt not take a loan against your IRA.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.980]   It invalidates the entire IRA
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.580]   as if the entire IRA was distributed.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.540]   - It's only taxable money.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.940]   - So this is just taxable money.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.340]   And back to our guy, Bazaad, and back to our guy, Brian,
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.780]   this might be a reason to build up
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.260]   your non-qualified balance.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.660]   I like to think about hitting that first.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.580]   - But trying to game the system here.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.900]   So you're like putting off taxes forever.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.700]   It's especially with rates being variable,
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.660]   it's probably not going to work out for you.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.980]   And 'cause you'd have to pay the money back so quickly,
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.460]   you'd be pulling money out of the account
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.540]   to pay it back almost,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.820]   unless you had some sort of other source of income.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.660]   - Yeah, and it just depends.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.660]   So like as a timing strategy, absolutely consider it,
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.660]   but as a tax avoidance strategy,
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.740]   it's not going to work
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.740]   unless you pass these assets onto your kids.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.780]   - Again, when rates were lower,
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.180]   we had people borrowing against their portfolio
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.300]   to put like a down payment on a second home.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.820]   And 'cause the rates were, and it made a lot of sense,
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.180]   but then now once rates get jacked back up,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.020]   they're thinking, well,
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.100]   I need to pay this down immediately, right?
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.100]   - Anybody with a 5-1 arm is sweating bullets
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.980]   for the next two years.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.420]   So we'll see.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.260]   I mean, we'll see.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.100]   But as a strategy, as a tool and toolkit,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.780]   absolutely 100% mark.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.620]   I would consider it,
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.700]   but definitely talk it over
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.180]   and think long-term with this stuff.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.820]   - I mean, if we had a Michael J. Fox DeLorean
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.100]   in the driveway right now with Doc Brown
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.380]   saying get it up to 88,
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.060]   most of us would probably go back to like 2020, 2021
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.100]   and borrow as much money as we possibly could at 3%, right?
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.940]   - Yeah, buy a Tesla.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.300]   - Well, it's so easy in hindsight, right, to know.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.620]   That's an argument I've been making internally
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.380]   is everybody thinks interest rates are high.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.660]   You're like, when are they gonna go down?
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.940]   What if interest rates go up?
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.260]   Like we don't actually know
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.740]   how the future is gonna play out.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.420]   So 1.21 gigawatts, I'm with you.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.300]   Let's go back.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.060]   - I'll let you know when I buy a TLT
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.500]   and that's when rates will go up more.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.020]   - All right, that's when we can, all right.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.500]   - So can we just, before we leave,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.220]   can we talk about how many collars
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.340]   a man can have on his shirt?
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.380]   I'm just, can we go into fashion corner?
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.540]   'Cause that was my big question starting the show.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.820]   A great, great, great, great clothing,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.460]   great line, we're big fans.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.940]   But what is the limit, is it three?
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.940]   - Listen, there's only two shirts on here, Bill.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.260]   - Is there a limit, I'm not sure.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.620]   Hey, I have a quick bonus question if you guys don't mind.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.460]   - Yeah.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.820]   - Everyone is talking about student loans lately
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.940]   and for some reason people are asking me questions
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.380]   about student loans because payments are showing back.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.580]   Would you be okay with someone diverting some of their money
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.820]   that they would have been putting into retirement accounts
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.260]   to help pay down their student loans?
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.020]   Let's say, for instance, like my student loans
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.780]   are 7.5% interest rate, right?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.420]   - Okay, I was gonna say it's rate dependent
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.820]   'cause a lot of people were able to borrow
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.420]   at much lower rates.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.340]   This is something I've been really against for years.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.380]   I don't know why the government
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.580]   sets the rates so high on them.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.820]   When I graduated, my rates were 2.5%
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.220]   and I think if I made a certain amount of payments
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.260]   over five years, it dropped down to like two.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.060]   And interest rates were much higher back then.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.300]   I don't know why the government,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.780]   anyway, that's my soapbox rant here.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.180]   But yes, if the rate is, I don't know,
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.540]   higher than 5% or so right now
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.580]   and you wanna divert some,
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.740]   I think I don't see a huge problem with that.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.580]   No.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.500]   - No, 100% Duncan.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.420]   Yeah, and at 7%, again, it's negative compounding, right?
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.460]   So if it takes you 10 years to pay off that balance,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.500]   I would.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.180]   And frankly, the other point,
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.300]   and this is something that we talk a lot with our clients,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.260]   that like nothing feels better in life,
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.620]   I think, than paying off debt.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.340]   If you ask clients on a survey,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.100]   what was the best financial decision you made?
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.900]   Paying off the house, paying off the loan,
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.460]   that's usually at the top of the list.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.900]   So even if it's not the right mathematical answer,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.780]   Duncan, not having to make that student loan payment
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.420]   in a couple of years, that feels better
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.340]   than any tax savings.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.500]   - Which is funny coming from us, Bill,
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.220]   'cause you and I are the ones who said,
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.300]   a few years ago, we're never paying our mortgages off.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.140]   - That's mortgage.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.980]   (laughing)
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.420]   - Does that mean we're not human?
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.580]   We don't have human emotions, I guess,
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.420]   is what you're trying to say.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.060]   - Yeah, yeah, and it's one thing to live life
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.900]   on a spreadsheet.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.780]   I think that can give you the answer.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.660]   But again, it makes a lot of sense
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.220]   to right sides of your life for what you wanna achieve,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.060]   right, and what you wanna do.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.180]   So yeah, I would prioritize paying off debt at 7%.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.980]   - Yeah, at that rate, I think so too.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.380]   - Amen. - That's good advice.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.580]   - Okay, good question.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.040]   Thanks to Bill and Duncan, as always.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.540]   - This is a fun one.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.700]   - Thank you to John behind the scenes,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.540]   and Nicole in the chat.

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.660]   (upbeat music)
