[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.280]   This session, however, is going to be
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.460]   one I've been looking forward to.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.500]   We're gonna be talking about financial independence.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.900]   Our interviewee is gonna be Brad Barrett.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.180]   Barrett, he's the host of the Top 50 Business Podcast,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.020]   Choose FI.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.220]   He's passionate about financial independence
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.860]   and mostly helping people take action
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.940]   to make their lives richer in every way.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.740]   Wealth, health, connections, and ultimately, happiness.
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.220]   He achieved financial independence at 35,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.980]   which is pretty impressive to those of us
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.140]   who didn't come out of residency until about that age,
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.800]   and lives in Richmond, Virginia
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.000]   with his wife and two daughters, so welcome.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.180]   Interviewing him is Sean Mullaney.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.260]   He's an advice-only financial planner
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.420]   and the president of Mullaney Financial and Tax.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.420]   He writes the Plutus award-winning blog, FI Tax Guy,
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.340]   on the intersection of tax and financial independence.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.620]   He also has a personal finance YouTube channel
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.420]   and published a book that apparently
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.300]   21 million people in this country need,
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.820]   Solo 401(k), The Solopreneur's Retirement Account,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.900]   a book about his favorite retirement account in 2022.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.540]   So, Sean and Brad, take it away.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.060]   - Thank you very much, Jim.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.900]   Before we get started, I do want to address
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.540]   the elephant in the room.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.700]   Oh.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.900]   - And I'll be collecting questions during the session.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.360]   - Yeah, yeah, so your questions go to Jim.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.540]   I do want to address the elephant in the room.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.020]   A lot of people believe financial independence
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020]   is all about deprivation.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.300]   Well, I think we can safely say after two nights
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.300]   at the luxurious, the opulent Bethesda North Marriott,
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.820]   that is most certainly not true.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.860]   So, well, Brad, thanks so much for being here today with us.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.700]   - Yeah, thank you for having me.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.940]   - Looking forward to this conversation.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.020]   Let's kick it off with what has the pursuit
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.080]   of financial independence meant to you?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.580]   - Yeah, that's a good one, Sean.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.080]   So, the pursuit of financial independence
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.420]   has essentially changed everything in my life.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.420]   It took me from, I was a corporate tax accountant
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.420]   doing corporate state tax returns,
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.220]   which, as you can imagine, is as mind-numbing
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.940]   and Groundhog Day as that sounds.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.060]   And now I'm, I think it's not hyperbole to say,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.220]   I am a different human being.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.220]   I get to spend time seeing my daughters grow up.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.660]   I, at this point, now they're 15 and almost 12,
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.660]   and I left my corporate career eight and a half years ago.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.700]   So, since they were little girls, I've been home.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.380]   And I've been there every single day
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.340]   when they get off the bus.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.460]   And as Sean said, I think the caricature of FI
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.540]   is that it's about deprivation.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.420]   And I reject that so wholly you can't even imagine.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.380]   Because to me, it's about reorienting
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.860]   to what actually matters in life.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.980]   And having the financial wherewithal
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.900]   to not be stressed constantly, right?
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.740]   So, obviously, speaking to the choir here at Bogleheads,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.340]   but nevertheless, most people are financially stressed
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.600]   all the time.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.980]   And that is an ever-present,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.460]   and they can't think about anything else.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.420]   But when you focus on saving money,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.500]   obviously investing wisely, but saving money specifically,
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.860]   and you have some net worth,
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.380]   you have some space to take a step back and say,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.060]   what do I actually want to do in life?
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.180]   What do I want my life to look like?
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.340]   And my wife and I, actually, it's interesting.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.140]   Sean and my wife went to high school together.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.420]   And we grew up about four minutes apart on Long Island
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.180]   and reconnected about, what, a handful of years ago?
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.500]   Five, eight years ago, give or take.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.700]   And my wife and I lived in this high-cost-of-living area.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.220]   And we got married at 26 years old
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.780]   and basically decided at the point,
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.860]   okay, look, we're both CPAs.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.680]   We have done everything conventionally well.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.100]   We've succeeded college and getting great jobs
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.540]   at the best accounting firms.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.020]   But it all seemed like a hamster wheel.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.520]   It all seemed like this never-ending,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.020]   the carrot when you're at an accounting firm
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.980]   or an investment bank, et cetera, or a law firm is,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.340]   oh, I can make partners someday, right?
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.180]   But I looked around, and I looked at the partners,
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180]   and I saw them working until 2 a.m.,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.980]   just like I was in tax season.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.420]   I mean, literally, this is the old days, right?
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.560]   But literally stapling tax returns with me
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.960]   at 1.45 in the morning because April 15th
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.520]   or October 15th, the deadline's coming up, right?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.760]   And that just, that wasn't a life that I aspired to.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.860]   It didn't make any sense.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.640]   And at 22, I looked around and said,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.320]   okay, there has to be something better.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.360]   There has to be some purpose here other than just
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.240]   I'm going to do this for the next 40 years.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.800]   I just simply didn't want to.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.000]   And luckily, my wife is of similar mind,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.160]   and we just saved money.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   And at that point, we didn't have an investing philosophy.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.480]   We hadn't come across J.L. Collins, Simple Path to Wealth,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   or Bogleheads, or Vanguard.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.300]   But when we focused on our savings rate,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.200]   it enabled us to really stockpile money
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.120]   and give us choices.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.720]   And when we got married, like I was saying a minute ago,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.080]   we decided, okay, look, we can make a life here
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.160]   on Long Island, but we don't want to.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.440]   It's always gonna be giving something up.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.320]   There was no way that one of us could stay home
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.800]   with these future fictional kids, as I like to call it.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.240]   At that point, we didn't have kids,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.000]   but we knew someday we would want to.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   And it's incredible now to look 15 years,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   18 years after the fact, and say, wow,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   all those plans we set out as, I mean, kids, 25,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.360]   it's worked out better than I could have possibly imagined.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.480]   So, yeah, it's interesting.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.280]   Sean, it's been a wild journey.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   - Yeah, and Brad, I really like some of that reframe there,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.120]   because essentially, you and your wife, Laura,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.240]   met one of the biggest goals of financial independence
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.580]   well before you ever retired from your day job, right?
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.640]   You were able to have your wife stay home
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.840]   with your children, and you weren't financially independent
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.680]   at that point.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.960]   You probably weren't even all that close.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.800]   Maybe, I don't know your numbers, but.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.760]   - No, you're right, you're right.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.400]   - So I think that's just a great reframe of the whole,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.040]   people think it's tech bros,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.960]   and we're gonna get to retire at 40.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.080]   Well, no, you just saw it with the Barretts,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.520]   that it was, hey, step one, goal one, a huge goal,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.480]   is mom gets to stay home with the two daughters.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.280]   I think that's fantastic, Brad.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.520]   - Yeah, and you hit on something, which is,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.640]   there's, many of you have heard of FIRE, right?
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   So Financial Independence Retire Early.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   And I feel like the RE is such a distraction.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.280]   It becomes this, it sucks up all the oxygen
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.760]   in the room, essentially.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.360]   People only focus on, oh, what are you gonna do?
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.920]   Sit around, do nothing, just be unproductive,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.280]   and just waste away, in essence.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   And it becomes, oh, these 30-year-old kids,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.160]   they're just doing nothing.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.240]   And I just, again, that's something I reject
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   so significantly.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.720]   I don't know anybody, well, A, as you notice,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.680]   this is about financial independence.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.960]   There's no retire early.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.240]   My podcast is choose F-I, not choose FIRE,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.280]   because, again, it's a distraction.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.080]   The RE is irrelevant.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   I don't know, I know there are a lot of my friends here
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.120]   in the audience who also create content
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.280]   in the financial independence world,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.800]   and I can't think of one single person I've ever met
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.360]   in the FI world that just sits around and does nothing.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.720]   Because that's not what we aspire to.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.080]   We aspire to make a difference in the world.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.160]   We aspire to add value to our community.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.520]   Whatever you define community as,
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.080]   could be as micro as your neighborhood
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.880]   to your religious organization,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.840]   to the local nonprofit, to your university,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   to whatever it may be.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.400]   And when you have that time and space
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.160]   to focus on these things, you actually can
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.800]   for the first time in your life.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.760]   So it does feel a little bit odd for many of us
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.000]   to step off the career path,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.680]   because I think so many of us have defined success
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   as the career path, but if you can just reframe it
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.040]   and not think that you're being unproductive
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.920]   or people are gonna look at you differently
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.480]   or negatively, and just say,
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.080]   there is a big wide world out there,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.040]   and if I'm really, really fortunate,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.800]   I get nine decades on this planet, right?
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.920]   Think about that, really fortunate.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.160]   You get nine healthy decades.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.320]   To spend any of that additionally working for money
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.160]   in a job that you don't absolutely love,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.200]   that you're not cartwheeling down the road to go to,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.960]   I think that's the height of folly.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.560]   It doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.000]   - Brad, what are your thoughts on the difference
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   between financial independence
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.560]   and conventional personal finance?
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.080]   - Oh, yeah, that's a good one, Sean.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.000]   So I would certainly not define Bogleheads
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.440]   as traditional personal finance.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.520]   I think to me, the biggest thing,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.200]   and we had thought about calling this talk
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   the superpower of financial independence.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.640]   I think the traditional personal finance world,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.520]   it's almost like fear-mongering to a large degree.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.600]   I know you hear the Susie Ormans of the world say,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.760]   oh, you can never retire,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   or you're gonna need $12 million because healthcare.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   Okay, well, healthcare is expensive.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.240]   Nobody's gonna deny that.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   But do you need, is $12 million completely made up?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   Yeah, of course it is.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.440]   Can most people aspire to 10, 12, $15 million?
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.040]   No, they can't.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.600]   So what do they do?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.000]   What do humans do when we're met with something
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.160]   that is just so far out of reach
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.280]   that we can't even contemplate it?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   We throw our hands up and we go on YOLOing our lives, right?
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.600]   And I think what Phi does is, and the biggest superpower,
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   is it reorients around what you can control.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.120]   And I think this is really the biggest distinction
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   is Phi looks at, and it's funny
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.800]   because this is gonna be the least technical talk
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.080]   of this entire weekend, obviously, by a mile,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.480]   but Phi looks at what does my life cost?
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.800]   Okay, it's not just some magical number
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.440]   for your financial independence or your retirement number.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's not based on what a retirement calculator says
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.200]   because, I mean, frankly, those are fundamentally flawed
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.480]   because they start with your current income,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.000]   which is wholly irrelevant to what you actually need
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.120]   in retirement or financial independence
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.040]   or whatever you wanna call it.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.360]   We look at what does my life cost?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.760]   And that's actually what I need to cover
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.160]   to live each year, right?
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.200]   Just very simply.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.120]   Again, this is a rethink,
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.480]   but it's pretty evident once we think about it.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   And then, again, the technical,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.760]   we can have large, in-depth conversations,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   but just very simply, even just saying the 4% rule.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.040]   Again, we'll put to the side the analysis
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.440]   and just say, all right, my life costs $80,000 a year
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.160]   multiplied by 25, I need $2 million.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.720]   That's my Phi number, mine.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.880]   It's not what Susie Orman tells me.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.200]   It's my Phi number because my life costs $80,000 a year.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.760]   And now, of course, that's gonna change
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   and seasons of life, you can model that clearly.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.160]   But I think what's so beautiful about the message of Phi
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.640]   is there is some degree of certainty
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.480]   and you control the starting point.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.720]   And like Sean said, there is a caricature
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.920]   of Phi being about deprivation.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.480]   And I think that's because, frankly,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.000]   many of the early adherents of the Phi world
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   were people who, Jacob from early retirement extreme
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.840]   who spends, whatever it is, $8,000 a year on his life.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.000]   I don't aspire to that.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   I can't imagine any of you do either.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.840]   I mean, that's not a life I want to live,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.480]   but if Jacob wants to live that, then wonderful.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.320]   That's great.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.160]   If your life costs $30,000 a year, all right,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.280]   well, you need, what, $750,000 to reach Phi.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.740]   And that's your life and you control it.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.640]   And so again, I think just that fundamental starting point
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.720]   is really the biggest difference, Sean.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.400]   - Brad, what do you think are the superpowers
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.040]   of financial independence?
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.400]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I guess that is honestly,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.960]   that's one of them is really that starting point.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.720]   Yeah, superpowers.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.360]   So I jotted down some things here.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.280]   So right, it certainly gives you certainty.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.320]   I think your savings rate being critical.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.620]   So I don't know if anybody's ever heard
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.840]   of Mr. Money Mustache, which is kind of a funny name,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.680]   but he's the biggest name
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.160]   in the financial independence world.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.560]   And he has an article that I would suggest
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   every single person read.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.480]   It's called "The Shockingly Simple Math
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.680]   Behind Early Retirement."
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.600]   And I think this is one of those aha moments.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.360]   So yeah, everybody that's, take a second, write this down.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.960]   "Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement."
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.600]   Because when you see it,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.400]   it's one of those moments you can't unsee.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.800]   It's similar to when you learn about Vanguard
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.860]   and low-cost index fund investing.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.960]   You can't unsee it.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.800]   When you see that, hey, if I had my money
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   in a 1% expense ratio fund with a 1% advisory AUM,
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.760]   I'm gonna lose whatever it is,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.080]   30 to 50% of my net worth over a 40-year period.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.880]   You can't unsee that.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   It's the same with this in terms of,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.360]   hey, what is your savings rate?
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.320]   And Sean, this frankly goes back to your question,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.360]   what's the biggest difference
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.560]   between traditional personal finance and FI
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.200]   is traditional personal finance says,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   oh, you're succeeding if you save 5 or 10% of your income.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.520]   And yeah, I mean, to some degree,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.200]   you're certainly better than living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.080]   We can all agree on that.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   Or going in the red every month.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.880]   Obviously, saving 5 or 10% is better.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.160]   But when you look at that article,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.960]   and I don't have it committed to memory, unfortunately,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   but it's something absurd like 45 or 50-year working lifetime
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.680]   you would reach financial independence.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.280]   If you save 10%, it would take you about,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.920]   is that roughly somewhere in the vicinity of 40 years?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.840]   - Something like that, I'm not entirely sure.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.760]   - Again, don't quote us,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.520]   but it's somewhere right around there.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.000]   It might even be more, frankly.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.500]   But if you save 50% of your income,
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.200]   which to most people sounds outlandish,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.600]   but if you happen, like I think about my daughters,
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.720]   before they've made any mistakes, right?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.880]   Before they bought fancy cars and a big house
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.820]   and went to college and got $200,000 of debt,
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:53.080]   if I can reorient them around saving 50% of their income,
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.240]   I would argue you essentially cannot possibly
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.040]   screw up your financial life
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.200]   if you save 50% of your income.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.720]   You can, I mean, I've done incredibly stupid things.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.080]   I invested in some real estate speculation
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.680]   when I was in 2007, 2008,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.080]   that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.780]   and because I oriented around a significant savings rate,
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.980]   it's but a blip.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.200]   I mean, sure, would I love to have compounded?
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.800]   It's probably $700,000.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.880]   Would I love to have that money?
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.040]   Obviously, I would.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.120]   But I don't think about it ever again
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.640]   because it was but a blip.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.200]   And so you look at that article,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.720]   and I think he has it as if you save 50% of your income,
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.160]   you reach fly in 17 years in his article.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.480]   I think a lot of people have it
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.320]   a little less than that, actually, 14 years.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.920]   So somewhere, again, we're not gonna quibble
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.880]   over exact details,
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.280]   but somewhere in the 14 to 17 year period,
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.740]   that sounds like a much better working career
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.240]   than 40, 50, 60 years.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.400]   So again, orienting around savings rate,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.380]   I think, is just absolutely critical.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.320]   - All right, let's get away from the technical stuff
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.040]   and back towards the lifestyle stuff.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.760]   Are there major life changes that are necessary
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.620]   in order to pursue financial independence?
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.320]   - Necessary, no.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.000]   But every single person,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.320]   and I almost cringed as the words were coming out
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.200]   of my mouth talking about my daughters
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600]   and saying, "Oh, before they bought fancy cars
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.560]   "or big houses."
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.960]   And frankly, if you saw my house,
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.280]   it's a nice big house
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.920]   in the best part of the Richmond metro area.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.640]   This is not about deprivation.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.800]   And if you wanna drive your BMW, great, do it.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.880]   Make choices based on value, okay?
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.280]   And what you value and not what your neighbor wants you,
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.560]   or the keeping up with the Joneses nonsense, right?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.320]   So I think, hold on, Sean,
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   I lost the plot on your actual question.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.040]   - So just the major lifestyle change,
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.480]   are there major life changes necessary?
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.560]   - Thank you, I'm sorry.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.720]   So, right, and I've led this story with,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.000]   I lived in a high cost of living area,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.440]   and I moved to a lower cost of living area,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.120]   which again, is something that I almost cringe about
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.120]   because I don't want anybody to think
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.520]   that that is a prerequisite,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.840]   that you have to live in Richmond, VA,
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   or Alabama, or wherever, fill in the blank.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.720]   Not the case at all.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   Again, it's orienting around a mindset of savings
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.520]   and savings rate, however that fits into your life.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.840]   It might, very simply,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.120]   there are two sides of an equation, right?
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   So earning additional income, upskilling, negotiating.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.960]   We have multiple episodes on salary negotiation,
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   which has been a remarkable thing for our community.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.560]   I mean, I get emails constantly from people,
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.040]   hey, the woman's name is Financial Mechanic, she goes by.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.480]   So I heard the episode with Financial Mechanic,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.120]   and I negotiated a $15,000 raise with my next job.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.240]   I get these all the time.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.760]   So obviously, there's two sides of an equation, clearly.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   But is your path to FI going to be accelerated
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.920]   by cutting out some of the frivolous waste,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.900]   which we all have, in your budget?
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.440]   Yeah, I mean, it obviously is.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.360]   I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you and say,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.280]   if you're living the YOLO mentality,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.520]   and you're living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.920]   or going into the red every single month,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.200]   that you can just continue doing that,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.280]   and reach FI in 10 years.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.280]   It's not gonna happen, right?
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.660]   What is the critical part,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.400]   and this is, I think, really the fundamental lesson
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.040]   from my podcast, which, I mean,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.760]   I'm not one of those pat myself on the back people,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.920]   but 600 episodes, 65 million downloads,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.320]   a community of hundreds of thousands
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.720]   of people across the world.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.160]   The common bond is very simply taking action, okay?
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:10.040]   So you can get all the information you want
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.940]   from Bogleheads this weekend.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.960]   But if you just sit there and just passively take it in,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   it's worth nothing.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.760]   You might as well go home.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.320]   You have to get up off the couch
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.400]   and take action to make your life better, very simply.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.480]   Hard stop, end of story.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.320]   So I think that is the thing that I've been hardened
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.560]   by most of people pursuing FI and people in our community
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.480]   is they understand that every situation is personal.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.080]   The old cliche, the personal finance is personal, right?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.700]   It is, because every one situation looks different,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.080]   and I don't give blanket advice to anybody.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.640]   The only advice is you have to take action
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.880]   to make your life better.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.280]   And you have to determine what is valuable
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.000]   to you in your life.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.660]   So for me, automobiles mean nothing.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.500]   They're literally gets me from point A to point B.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.880]   And driving old cars.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.040]   I recently upgraded from a 2003 Honda Civic
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.280]   to a 2013 Honda Civic, so you can tell
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.560]   just how much I care about what people think of me
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.680]   driving around, but that decision to essentially
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.560]   have no car payments for the last 20 years,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.200]   except for obviously two lump sums,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.640]   I think when compounded, that's a,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.100]   somewhere in the vicinity of $400,000 plus decision.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.960]   And obviously timeline, et cetera,
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.240]   we can go on into all this.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.580]   I have podcasts about it, but nobody really cares.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.440]   But it's a massive decision, right?
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.960]   And that's one thing.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   Do I feel like I'm depriving myself
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.920]   because I drive a 2013 Civic?
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.400]   No, gets me where I'm going.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.480]   Again, if you value that, if you value BMW or something,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.500]   okay, do it.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.440]   But understand, it's a finite pot of money, right?
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.220]   You can grow your income, but at the end of the day,
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.160]   the easiest first steps, I think,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.000]   are cutting frivolous things.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.520]   So yeah, I guess, Sean, that's what I would say.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.120]   It is certainly not a prerequisite,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.440]   but you have to take action.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.000]   So Brad, what type of investing strategies
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.180]   do most people pursuing financial independence follow?
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.840]   - Yeah, so this is near and dear to everyone here.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   Certainly it's, most people in the FI world
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.880]   follow J.L. Collins and his book, "Simple Path to Wealth."
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.960]   VTSAX, obviously Total Stock Market Index Fund
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.840]   from Vanguard, has become, really thanks to J.L.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   and his book and his message
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.260]   and the stock series on his website,
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.240]   that's almost become the default investment strategy.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.800]   And of course, it doesn't start and stop there.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.120]   But I think for a lot of people,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.560]   low-cost index fund investing is where the vast majority
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.000]   of people in the FI world put their money.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.360]   And I know for me, it was, and I'm sure many of you out there
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.760]   have had this same aha moment with Vogelheads,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.840]   is when you see it, again, it's one of those moments
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.280]   you can't unsee once you've seen it, right?
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.200]   You understand, all right, what is the likelihood
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.560]   that I'm going to beat the market?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.880]   Net of fees and taxes for trading
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.480]   over a 40, 50 year investing lifetime,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   what's the chance I'm gonna beat the market?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.800]   Approximately zero, right?
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.720]   So why would I even try?
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.120]   If like literally the brain-dead version,
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.800]   it's the only place I can think of in life
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.600]   where putting less effort in
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.120]   is going to get you better results.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   So again, I'm preaching to the choir here, obviously,
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.820]   I don't need to waste a lot of time on this,
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.800]   but yeah, the vast majority of people put the,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.400]   I would say the vast majority of their net worth
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.880]   in low-cost Vanguard and the like index funds.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.960]   There are many people who pursue real estate
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.480]   as an investing strategy, certainly.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.080]   There's a large overlap between the bigger pockets community,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.960]   anybody who's a real estate investor
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.760]   certainly recognizes bigger pockets.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   And of course, there are always the religious arguments
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.200]   of dividend investing and real estate
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.800]   and people thinking that their specific type of investment
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.880]   is gonna outperform.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.960]   I mean, I find it a little dubious at best,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.600]   yet to be swayed.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.880]   So the vast majority of my net worth
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.160]   is certainly in low-cost index funds.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.960]   So yeah, I mean, Sean, I think it's probably a pretty large,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.920]   there's a large sample,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.760]   but I would say the vast majority of people,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.920]   it's index funds and real estate.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.360]   - Yeah, it's certainly an area I think of overlap
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.000]   or alignment between the typical bogal head
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.320]   and the typical financial independence person.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.000]   You know, Brad, so you are one of the most prominent voices
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.600]   in the FI community.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.640]   And one of the things I appreciate about your voice
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.480]   is you're very goal-oriented, right?
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.720]   What are we trying to get to?
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.640]   What are we trying to achieve here?
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.360]   But you're certainly not the only voice
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.880]   in the financial independence community,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.160]   as it should be, right?
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.200]   I've got a question for you about that though.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.040]   Are tactics overemphasized
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.480]   within the financial independence community?
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.600]   - Ooh, so our tactics.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   So like precise tactics?
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.240]   - Yeah, I mean, things like,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.320]   it could be backdoor Roth IRA, it could be 529.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.120]   It could even be just maxing out your 401k,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.520]   getting your employer match.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.960]   Do we spend, you know, HSAs,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.880]   there are all sorts of tactics out there,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.000]   even on the investing side, right?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.120]   Are tactics too, are we focusing too much on tactics
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   in the financial independence movement
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.200]   over sort of the bigger picture and the goals?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.520]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.600]   So for me, I focus,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.880]   I don't wanna speak for the community at large, certainly,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.520]   but for me, I focus so little on the tactics.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.960]   So yeah, I mean, I guess I would say by extension,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.600]   if there is significant focus on the minutiae,
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.240]   I think it's missing the forest for the trees.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.080]   I really do.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.040]   So, because again, I think the biggest driving factor,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.960]   and obviously, all of the events that I've been to today
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.840]   have been phenomenal, but you know,
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.160]   we're getting into the weeds.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.160]   And I think if you're saving zero to 5% of your income
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.360]   and you're focusing on little tenths of a percent of return,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.120]   I think you're missing the forest for the trees.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.280]   I think the better way to start
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.440]   is to really prioritize your savings rate,
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.640]   because the bigger shovel you have to throw
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.360]   and just put it in low-cost Vanguard funds, ETFs,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.880]   wake up in 50 years, you know, what's the,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.120]   is it, I don't know if it's Bogle or if it's,
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   I think it was Bogle, wake up,
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.480]   you're gonna need a cardiologist on hand, right?
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   So to me, it's, all right, focus on savings rate,
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.600]   but then honestly, it's focus on your life.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.280]   I think so many of us, and this is something, frankly,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.840]   that is very personal for me now,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.480]   is so many of us lose sight of ourselves, right?
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.880]   Like we lose sight of who we are as humans,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.920]   what lights us up, what we wanna do
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.520]   with our finite time on this planet.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.560]   And again, this is very personal for me,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.920]   and I'll tell you honestly,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.600]   like this is something that's going on in my mind now.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.200]   I have focused, and again, our goal
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.240]   before our kids were born was to spend so much time
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.400]   with our kids, and mission accomplished,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.960]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.320]   But I think just like anything in life,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.920]   you can get out of balance.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.000]   And I think what Sean's question ultimately is asking is,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.680]   can we get out of balance with our personal finance?
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.540]   My question is, can we get out of balance with our lives?
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.160]   I think they're inextricably tied.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   I think you need to take those couple of steps back
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.800]   and figure out what you want your life to look like.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.500]   So I have these funny little examples of like,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.240]   it almost sounds laughable,
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.840]   but I think I've watched fewer than 10 movies
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.420]   in the last 15 years.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.920]   I think I used to be a huge English Premier League
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.840]   soccer fan, like back in the 1990s,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.800]   like before it was big here,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.560]   and like I probably watched fewer than 10 matches
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.980]   in the last 20 years.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.560]   And like, you know, again, this is very personal,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.720]   and this is not necessarily what this event is about,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.680]   but I think it's important,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.020]   and I think it's important to be honest with ourselves.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.200]   And of course, each of you are gonna have something
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.920]   different in your own minds and your own lives of,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.780]   all right, focus on what's actually important.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.760]   Don't necessarily focus on the little tenths of a percent
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   of, oh, if I over contribute to my 529,
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.040]   or if I contribute to my 529,
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.680]   I'm gonna get a state tax benefit,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.480]   and what's the absolute maximum?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.000]   Should I be in the Utah plan, or I live in Virginia?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.720]   You can do all that stuff.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.380]   And I think it's fine at the margins,
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.220]   and I think there is a place for it.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.080]   So I'm not saying it's not important,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.720]   but I think you have to look at your life.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.640]   I think you really do.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.920]   And you have to say, what am I doing here?
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.960]   What am I doing on this planet for the nine decades
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.760]   that I'm afforded if I'm really lucky?
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.520]   And don't focus on the tactics.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.260]   Don't focus on the minutia.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.640]   Focus on your relationships.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.560]   Focus on the real things that matter.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.940]   So yeah, Sean, I mean, that's what I got.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.160]   - Great.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.640]   So those of you in the audience,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.880]   you may listen to the Choose a Five podcast.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.520]   You may think of it as sort of a one-way street, right?
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.680]   Brad talks into a microphone, maybe he has a guest on,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.040]   but it truly is a two-way street, right?
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   Especially at the size and scale of Choose a Five,
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.320]   you should see how active their Facebook group is.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.080]   Brad has a very successful newsletter
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.440]   that he sends out every Tuesday.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.540]   He gets tons of responses to that.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.080]   So you really have sort of a view
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.560]   as to the community and the listener reaction.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.600]   And I'm gonna ask you something about the Five movement,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.160]   the Five community, and we're gonna talk about this
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.520]   a little later today, just in the Vogelheads context.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.640]   You know, I worry about other sources,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.160]   such as say TikTok, and what they're putting out
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.080]   about personal finance.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.600]   As much success as you've had, and as the Fire movement,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.200]   Five movement, whatever you wanna call it, has had,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.540]   are we missing 20 and 30 somethings?
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.800]   Are we missing a cohort out there
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.880]   that might be getting their financial information
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.360]   and education from other sources
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   that perhaps are looking to sell more financial products?
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.520]   You know, in places like TikTok,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.120]   I think we're probably somewhat familiar
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.280]   with things like IULs and all that.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.600]   There's a lot of that content on TikTok.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.240]   Or maybe, Brad, hopefully you're getting
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.980]   a lot of 20 and 30 something interaction.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.960]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.360]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   It's hard to say.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   I think there's always the allure of get rich quick, right?
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.340]   I think there's always the allure of
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.640]   there's some secret behind the curtain.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.580]   And I mean, I guess at this point,
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.140]   I have a fairly decent net worth.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.080]   I know a lot of other wealthy people.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.660]   I've yet to find the secret behind the curtain
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.620]   that's actually real.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.020]   Or hey, I'm let into this room now all of a sudden.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.700]   So, you know, for me,
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.820]   I orient my life around simplicity, certainly.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.260]   So, which again, is preaching to the choir here,
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.980]   and bogal heads investing.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.860]   But yeah, I mean, I think unfortunately, Sean,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.360]   and we saw this with GameStop, and we saw the Robinhood.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   I think there is a mentality of YOLO,
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.340]   some intersection of YOLO, get rich quick,
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.140]   and stick it to the man, right?
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   And not understanding that investing in stocks
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.780]   is not gambling, right?
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.260]   I think like, if we can proselytize for one thing
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.700]   here as bogal heads community, it would be everyone,
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.420]   you hear it, you hear the phrases, right?
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.420]   I'm gonna gamble, gamble in the stock market.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.240]   Like, people think of it as risky.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.220]   Like, I'm rolling the dice.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.840]   Like, I've actually heard people use this phrase.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.700]   Like, no, you're buying a tiny little ownership percentage
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.500]   of, in the case of VTSCX, of three to whatever it is,
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.140]   4,000 American companies and 100 plus million workers,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.960]   and their ingenuity and hard work.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.580]   That's a totally different thing.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.860]   It's not get rich quick.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.460]   It's you are buying a tiny little ownership piece
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.420]   of all of those companies, and getting all of these
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.380]   amazing American workers and workers across the world
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.000]   as essentially your employees, right?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.400]   So, yeah, I mean, Sean, I think, ultimately,
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.920]   everyone is susceptible to the get rich quick mentality.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   So, I think it's incumbent on people like us
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.120]   to, again, not stand up, and even though
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.040]   I just used proselytize, and shout from the rooftops
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.720]   and try to, like, win people over.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.400]   It's to look for people in our lives
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.080]   who might be open to a message of orienting around
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.040]   long-term thinking, around savings rate,
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.000]   around smart, low-cost investing.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.120]   And where do you find those people?
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.160]   How can you help them?
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.540]   Like, I have never found success in spouting.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.840]   I'm not a very outgoing person in general.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.880]   So, if you see me sometime later this weekend,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.520]   come up and say hello, 'cause I'm probably
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.840]   gonna be standing in the corner.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.480]   So, I'm not running around telling people about FI,
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.800]   but when I hear people talk about,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.680]   oh, I invested in my 401k, or even down to,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.320]   oh, I'm clipping coupons, like, people who are oriented
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.360]   around, again, somehow saving money,
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.120]   somehow thinking about money.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.320]   Because, I mean, I think all of us know
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.200]   the vast majority of people are just kind of YOLOing it,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   and we never learned, we never learned personal finance.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.320]   It's not like, I'm not blaming anybody.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.000]   It's all of our faults.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.800]   But if you can find those people,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.080]   I think we can make a difference in our own lives
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.780]   and families and communities in a very empowering
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.320]   and positive way, as opposed to demeaning people.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   Obviously, that never works.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.320]   Or talking down to entire groups of 20-somethings,
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.760]   whatever, fill in the blank.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.400]   And find people to help in your lives.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.280]   Find that younger niece or nephew or cousin
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.240]   who hasn't made mistakes yet.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.000]   And, of course, this is not predicate.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.440]   We have a lot of, we have Bill here
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.780]   from catching up to FI for late starters.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.780]   FI is not about getting it right at 17.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.760]   But it's a hell of a lot easier, right?
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.380]   Like, let's be honest.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.680]   But there are many people in the FI community,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.960]   I would even hazard to say the majority of people
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.320]   in the FI community who are finding it
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.840]   in their 40s and 50s.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.640]   So it's never too late.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.800]   But again, not to sound like a broken record,
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.080]   but you have to take action.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.840]   You just, you have to, very simply.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.220]   - By the way, so we're getting close to the time
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.160]   for the audience question.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.040]   So if you have one, please write it down.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.480]   Dr. Jim's in the back.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.880]   Brad, I'm gonna challenge you here with a two-parter, right?
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.880]   I know this isn't really fair, but I'm gonna do it anyway.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.400]   So are there contradictions
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.940]   in the financial independence movement and do they matter?
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.640]   And I'll give you an example, right?
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.320]   Maybe someone out there is in the FIRE movement,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.380]   FI movement, and they're like,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.280]   you know, I'm gonna retire early at say age 50.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.360]   Well, how are you gonna support yourself?
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.240]   I'm gonna leave corporate America, right?
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.100]   Done, right?
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.240]   No more nine to five job, no more corporate America.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.640]   All right, well, how are you gonna support yourself
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.200]   in your early retirement?
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.480]   Invest in corporate America, right?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.520]   So Brad, are there contradictions in the FIRE movement
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.480]   and do they matter?
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.960]   - Yeah, that's an interesting one, Sean.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.360]   I've never thought about that.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.280]   So yeah, this will be on the fly thinking,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   but I don't, oh, he's dangerous.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.160]   I don't think that's a contradiction, certainly,
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.360]   if that is a caricature.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.420]   Yeah, I mean, contradictions,
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.320]   where my mind goes,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.600]   and I don't know if this is necessarily a contradiction,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.120]   but is like the,
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.160]   this is going back to the RE, the retire early.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.000]   And if you take that as kind of the bare bones of this,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.880]   whether you believe that or not,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.040]   but a lot of people think,
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.300]   okay, once you leave your corporate job,
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.540]   that you have to be done.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.400]   You're retiring early, hanging up the boots, whatever,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.040]   and riding off into the sunset, and that's it.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.200]   And you're gonna sit on a beach and sip umbrella drinks.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   And that's the only definition of successful FIRE,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.320]   which you can tell, dripping with sarcasm,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.860]   because I think that's preposterous.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.600]   I think what most of us actually aspire to
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.280]   is making a difference, however we define that.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.120]   So again, Sean, I'm not sure if this
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.560]   is necessarily a contradiction,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.780]   but I think what should be apparent to all of us
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.780]   is after you leave your traditional job,
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.800]   or frankly, renegotiate your current situation.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.900]   I think what FIRE does is it gives you power,
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.760]   and it reorients, and this doesn't mean lord it over people,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.160]   or be a jerk at work because you can,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.000]   because you have power.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.880]   It doesn't mean that at all, obviously.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.820]   But what it means is when you are not beholden to your job,
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.200]   like most people are, right?
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.280]   Most people's lives will fall apart
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.160]   in somewhere between 30 and 90 days
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.840]   without their current income,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.640]   because they live paycheck to paycheck.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.080]   It's a house of cards.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   They might even make a nice income.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.920]   But if you spend it all, and you have no net worth,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.840]   you are poor.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.340]   You know, that sounds a little extreme,
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.400]   but it is the truth.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.360]   If you have no net worth, you're living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.260]   I don't care if you make 70 grand or 300.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.540]   Same bottom line, same net worth, right?
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   So I think, yeah, ultimately,
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.960]   it's like I was saying.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.600]   You can reorient and not lord this over people,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   but what do I actually like as part of my job?
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.760]   For people that, I'm sure there are many of you
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.040]   who would say, "I love my job."
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.420]   And I believe you to a degree,
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.100]   but I'm sure there are many aspects of your job
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.660]   that you don't love.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.840]   I'm sure nobody wants to go to endless meetings
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.700]   and fill in TPS reports and whatever other nonsense, right?
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.300]   Well, I wonder if there's a way to re,
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.620]   I don't know, reorient?
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.340]   I guess I'm overusing that word,
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.380]   but to change the entire way that your job looks
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:15.180]   and add more value, potentially the same value,
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.900]   with less time spent at the office, okay?
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.140]   So what does that look like
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.120]   when you reach financial independence
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.100]   and the power is in your court?
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:28.500]   Could it look like, "Hey, I only want to come in
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.260]   "three days a week for four hours,
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.180]   "but I really love this aspect of my job,
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.380]   "and I think I do it in a way
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.620]   "that would be really hard to replace."
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.260]   Nobody's irreplaceable, obviously,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.180]   but this would be really hard to replace,
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.540]   and there's no need to because I want to keep doing this.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.940]   Well, I think the powers that be at your office
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.320]   will be a little bit taken aback at first,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   but I suspect you have more power than you think.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.180]   And that would be kind of like a parting message
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.820]   that I would leave to everyone here is,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.300]   I think you have more power than you believe,
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:13.340]   and when you are at this point of financial independence,
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.560]   and even, frankly, far before it,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:21.220]   the power just keeps subtly shifting towards you,
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.560]   and then you can actually devise a life
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.340]   that you want to live, and it's not just the same
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.140]   groundhog day nonsense over and over again.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.420]   So, John, I didn't exactly answer your question,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.860]   but I think the contradiction is,
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.820]   it's ultimately like, it's not either/or, right?
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.620]   Like, you're going to be doing something,
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.980]   but you're gonna be doing it on your terms,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.260]   and that might mean earning income.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.840]   For most people, it will be in some way,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.780]   but it doesn't have to be the same amount of income.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.180]   It can be a tiny little fraction.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.940]   It can be anything.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.460]   The ball is in your court,
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.840]   and I think that is just so powerful.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.780]   - All right, we've got some audience questions.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.780]   We don't have that much time,
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.780]   but we're gonna try to get through some of them.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.420]   This one's very personal to you, Brad.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.420]   How did you feel about your portfolio during March 2020,
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.340]   and did you rebalance or spend less
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.420]   after restrictions were lifted?
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:21.580]   - Yeah, this is a good one.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:27.180]   I think all of us would like to believe,
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.580]   like Dr. Jim over here,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.820]   that we have an investor policy statement,
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.380]   and we have steeled ourselves
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.380]   for whatever calamity is gonna befall us or the world,
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:47.700]   and I think what's really important to remember
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.660]   is we're all human, right?
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.660]   And I think, for me, 90% of personal finance
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.580]   is up here in this little primitive brain,
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.220]   and 10% of it is numbers and getting the minutiae
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.780]   and all the tactics right.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.020]   So yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.700]   In March of 2020, when the world,
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.800]   when who the heck knew what was gonna happen,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.900]   I mean, I freaked out like everybody else did,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:22.780]   and luckily, because I have some degree of knowledge
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.420]   and I understand that this is, in this case,
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.820]   a 60-year investing horizon,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.520]   I didn't sell everything and run for the hills
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.280]   and buy gold and MREs and whatever other nonsense, right?
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.900]   But the thought crossed my mind, you know?
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.820]   I'm sure it did most of us.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.340]   But obviously, that's what having
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.580]   an investor policy statement, where that helps,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.000]   or even if you don't have it written down,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.260]   just understanding that this stuff happens, right?
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.060]   It's not gonna be COVID next time.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.460]   It's gonna be something.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.480]   Something is coming, right?
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.540]   And we've all seen the numbers,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.740]   and I'm not gonna get the paraphrasing right,
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.340]   but if you miss the 12 best days in the market
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.340]   over a 20-year period, you lose X% of the return, right?
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:12.840]   You cannot let your emotions rule you.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.700]   But man, it's hard, right?
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.540]   It's hard.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.800]   I think a lot of us freaked out.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.820]   So did I sell a little bit?
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.740]   I mean, this might be the first time I've publicly said,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.460]   yeah, I did.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.660]   It wasn't a lot, thankfully.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.700]   It was just, it was emotional and it was rash
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.900]   and it was stupid, frankly, and it obviously cost myself,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.100]   but it was, luckily, I didn't make anything terrible.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.060]   This wasn't a significant thing.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   So my, and I guess to the second part of the question,
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.860]   I am still in an unusual place where my,
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.260]   I own a number of websites.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.140]   I travel miles 101 where I help people travel the world
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.780]   with credit card points, and I choose a FI.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.420]   So I'm earning enough money to cover my life expenses.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.060]   So in all candor, there has never been a month
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.000]   where I've had to draw down on my assets.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.860]   So I am not the prototypical, but again,
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.380]   there is no prototypical FI person
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.860]   'cause I think many of us continue to earn
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.620]   some amount of money after we've reached FI.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.300]   But yeah, have I reached a point
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.380]   where I'm earning zero dollars and drawing down?
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:26.180]   No, so I mean, frankly, my tactics and strategy
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.900]   didn't have to change, which I think
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.740]   is perfect world scenario anyway,
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.260]   that hey, I'm not changing anything amidst calamity
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.460]   or coming out of a calamity.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.740]   I think we should all, again, the hardest part is up here.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.620]   Let's all be honest with ourselves, right?
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.620]   So anything you can do, it's like running the reps on things.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.500]   How can you get these reps in?
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.120]   And do we want calamities to befall us
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:53.960]   to get these reps in?
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.420]   No, but okay, I've been through 2008,
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.500]   and again, I screwed up royally on real estate there,
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.380]   but at least I've learned, and now I look at real estate
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.180]   as I own a couple single-family rentals down in Georgia,
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.100]   and I own them mortgage-free, and nothing can go wrong.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.700]   So that was a lesson that I took from it,
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.220]   and I will never make that speculation mistake ever again.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.380]   I learned that I am as susceptible to freaking out
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.900]   as anybody amidst a market downturn,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.540]   but now I understand the emotion.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.100]   I understand what's gonna happen the next time
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.700]   in my own head, and hopefully, I'm the wiser for it.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.820]   - Here's a little one, Brad,
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.100]   that is near and dear to your own heart.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.220]   Kids are expensive.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.780]   What advice do you have for parents of young children
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.580]   seeking to reach financial independence?
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:57.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I think kids can be expensive.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:01.980]   I don't think kids necessarily are by definition expensive,
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:06.980]   though I guess if we look at opportunity cost,
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.580]   which I think, so I would argue that my kids
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.660]   have not been terribly expensive, like out of pocket,
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:19.980]   but I think that would be a silly analysis
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.860]   because the opportunity cost is my wife
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.460]   has not been working now, essentially, for 15 years.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.380]   So I would have to be a fool to stand up here and say,
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.660]   "Kids are not expensive," right?
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.600]   So opportunity cost has to function,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.940]   has to matter in any equation.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:42.700]   I think pursuing FI with kids
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.900]   is just like pursuing FI, to a large degree, without kids,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.540]   in the sense that it's about choices, right?
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.940]   So, and every single person is different.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.660]   Now, my kids are both excellent,
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.420]   like I guess they were, national-level swimmers
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.860]   as younger girls, and we had them
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.220]   in a very expensive year-round swim program,
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.220]   and that was a choice we made,
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.540]   and that was very, very expensive,
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.220]   but we made that choice from a place of value,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.300]   and I think that's the important part is,
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.700]   so I'll take this 30,000-foot view,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.720]   is make any spending decision, whether kids
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.260]   or just in your own life, from a place of value
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.260]   and not from a place of impressing people or, right,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.020]   impressing your neighbors or whatever it may be,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.900]   and frankly, so this swim program,
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.220]   I said it was in the past tense,
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.020]   is they fell out of love with it.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.200]   It's anybody, I don't know if anybody has swimmers in here,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.780]   but that is a brutal sport.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.180]   I mean, they're swimming 20,000 yards a week,
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:59.020]   and it's just ludicrous, and we could've forced them, right?
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.580]   If we were parents who cared about,
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.220]   "Oh, my kid got a scholarship,"
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.820]   or, "My kid is swimming Division I,"
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.340]   like, they could've easily done that,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.900]   but they fell out of love with it,
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.660]   and that was the day they stopped swimming
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.620]   because it wasn't about us, right?
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.340]   So I think a lot of parents, and this goes,
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.580]   let's all be honest with ourselves,
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:23.140]   it goes with the car decal that you put up
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.220]   on the back of your car, right?
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.540]   Like, again, my daughter, who's the older one
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.180]   who's an excellent swimmer, that very easily
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.900]   could've said, "MIT," but she stepped off that hamster wheel,
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.100]   she stepped off the swimming,
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.900]   and it was made with eyes wide open.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.740]   And, you know, I'm kinda going off the rails here,
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:48.020]   but I think the more important point is,
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.400]   yes, kids can be expensive, but I think, just like anything,
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.860]   kids don't want fancy stuff.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.380]   They want your time, and they want your attention,
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.700]   and they want you to put the stupid phone down
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.660]   and just spend time with them, right?
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.580]   So like, yeah, kids can be expensive as you make them,
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.440]   or they can be as inexpensive
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:18.060]   as your family wants it to be, right?
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.140]   Like, there's so many free, amazing,
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.440]   I live in Richmond, VA, which is not, like,
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.120]   the center of the universe, by any means,
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.820]   but we could do something free, outdoors,
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.980]   or some festival, every weekend of the year,
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.060]   if we decided, and that costs nothing.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.820]   I know we had, and I know we're running out of time here,
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.960]   but Liz from Frugal Woods, on way back in,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.940]   I think it was, like, episode 12 of "Choose a Buy"
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.340]   in early 2017, and she was saying
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.820]   that the interesting thing of living in a city
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.880]   is everybody thinks it's so expensive.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.900]   She's like, "That's laughable."
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.860]   Yeah, it's expensive to actually, the rent,
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.820]   but everything else is free.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.220]   They lived in Boston, and there are 30 universities there
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.780]   with events every single weekend,
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.340]   so I think the larger point that I would give
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.340]   to everybody here is think a little bit differently, okay?
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.420]   We're all thinking a little bit differently
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.940]   being here at Bogleheads.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.820]   We're thinking a little bit differently
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.320]   being in the Phi community.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.940]   Think a little bit differently.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.380]   You don't have to be cookie cutter.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.860]   You can actually do what you want to do
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.260]   based around your values, so that's my challenge.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.900]   Think a little bit differently,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.000]   and get up off the couch, and take action.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.140]   - Brad, well, first of all, thank you for being here today,
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.660]   and can we get a round of applause for Brad Barrett?
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.060]   (applause)
