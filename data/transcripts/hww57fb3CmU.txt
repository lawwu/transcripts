[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   The only way to get really good at something
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.000]   is to actually be focused.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.580]   Use the word prioritization.
[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   If you have more than three priorities, you have zero.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.800]   Very few companies go on to become excellent, great.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.120]   Even very few companies go on to keep existing.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.720]   Even really, really good companies
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.800]   that we think are good right now
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.320]   are not gonna exist in five or 10 years.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.240]   Good will stop existing, just remember that.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.280]   Good is gonna stop existing, it's gonna fail.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.040]   Good will fail, only the great can even have a shot
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.080]   at succeeding, let alone continuing to exist.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.880]   I'm just talking business, but this also fits with life.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.120]   So the companies that become great let go
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.720]   of everything that is merely good.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.160]   They are hyper-focused.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.840]   And so you don't need to think about your future self
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.280]   in like 50 different factors.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.560]   It's actually just two or three, right?
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.200]   Like you've got two or three areas of life
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.560]   that you're massively going to focus on, invest in,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.360]   and honestly, quote unquote, take 10X,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.760]   like take to a totally different level.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   You know, there's a great quote that says,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.760]   "It's better to be a meaningful specific
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.720]   "than a wandering generality."
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.600]   So like when it comes to your future self, be specific,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.480]   highly specific, and it can't be specific in 50 ways.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.720]   maybe specific in three.
