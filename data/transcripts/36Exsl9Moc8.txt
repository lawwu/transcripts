[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   My favorite all-time quote on, on being a startup founder is from Sean
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.240]   Parker, who says, starting a company is like chewing glass, eventually you
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.480]   start to have a taste of your own blood.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.960]   That quote always gives people like this.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.980]   I always get this queasy look at the face of people I'm talking
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.900]   to, and I roll that quote out.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.780]   But it really is, it's really intense.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.400]   And so I always tell people, whenever anybody asks me if they should start a
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.840]   company, the answer is always no, because it's just, it's such a, just like
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   gigantic, like emotional, irrational kind of thing to do.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.640]   The implications of that decision is so profound in terms of how you live your
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.560]   life that I, yeah, look, there, there are plenty of great ideas, plenty of
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.280]   interesting things to do, but the actual process is so difficult.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.200]   It, it gets romanticized a lot and it's not romantic.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.340]   It's a very difficult thing to do.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.360]   And I did it, I did it multiple times before.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.400]   So at least for now I don't, I don't revisit that.
