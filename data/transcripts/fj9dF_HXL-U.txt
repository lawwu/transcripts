[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   the default thinking here when it comes to speaking with agents is that your conversation
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.360]   or chat history with a agent is a set of messages but i think the better way of thinking about chat
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.440]   history and interactions is not to think of them as chat history or interactions the better way is
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.080]   to think about this as a sequence of events this sequence of events does not need to be user
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.280]   assistant user assistant and when we think more about these as events it becomes much more obvious
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.840]   that an agent is more of a workflow execution engine that goes and performs different tasks
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.200]   based on particular triggers those triggers might be a user sending a message but it could be something
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.000]   else so it's best to think about the interactions with a agent as being more a log of events
