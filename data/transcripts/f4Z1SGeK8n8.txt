[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Episode 1001 now in the life of the podcast, and our question today comes
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   from a longtime listener named Jordan. "Dear Pastor John, what is your
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.320]   conviction about owning a pet? Do you have any pets, or do you see them more as
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.200]   a hindrance and a distraction when considering how we should spend our time
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.000]   here during our short stay on earth?"
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.400]   Well, the first thing I would say is surely, yes, pets can take up too much of
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   your time and too much of your money, just like food can, and health can, and
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   family can, and church can, and work can, and every hobby under the sun can, and
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.960]   sports can, and all manner of entertainment can, and cars can, and
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.800]   clothes can, and home improvement projects can, and lawn care can, and
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.240]   exercise can, and hanging out with friends can, etc., etc. Yes, yes, yes, pets and
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.480]   anything else besides the glory of God can be a distraction from what we ought
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.600]   to be doing. Yes, right, good warning. So, if your conscience is indicting you for
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.040]   the money you spend, or the time you spend combing your dog's fur, or
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.880]   scratching her behind the ears, you should stop. Stop. You should get rid of
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.240]   the dog. No pet is worth the damaging of your conscience. Or, if you look at the
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.680]   sixty billion dollars a year that Americans spend on pets annually and
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.720]   resolve to spend nothing, absolutely nothing, in order to protest that
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.440]   priority, you are fully justified so to protest, keeping in mind that America
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.560]   spends 1.8 billion dollars on toothpaste annually, and 22 billion dollars on air
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   conditioning annually, and 2.8 billion dollars at Halloween on candy, and 48
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   billion dollars a year on coffee. So, we have to be careful with the way we use
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   our numbers. The question with regard to time and money is not only whether it's
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   exorbitant, which it can be, but shouldn't be, but even if it's modest, would that
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.480]   time, if you had no pet, be devoted to more refreshing, more encouraging, more
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   edifying, more loving, more God-glorifying tasks? That's the question.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.520]   Mathematically, you might compute that those ten minutes or half hour a day
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   could be better used, but my question is, would they? The same could be said about
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.440]   almost any activity of lesser importance in our lives. Giving up, would they
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.040]   automatically be then piled into the other column of more significant
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.120]   activity? I think we will go mad, at least John Piper will go mad, if we try to live
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   our lives in that kind of mathematical way. We all know that there is excess
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   that dishonors God in lesser matters, and we should spot that and avoid that, and
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.960]   far too many of us fail to spot that and avoid that. But if we think we can
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:39.000]   do that every minute of our day and use only what is maximally useful in those
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   minutes, we'll probably become a victim of a mental disorder. They've got names
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.080]   for those, and I certainly would. I have tried it. So, why might one consider a pet
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.800]   worthy of even a small amount of money and amount of time? And my main answer
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.160]   would be based on why God created animals at all. He didn't have to, and
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.920]   Genesis seems to say he meant for the air and the land and the sea to be full
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.960]   of creatures. God delights, it seems, in, let me call it, variegated fullness of
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.640]   space. Really, really variegated, like millions upon millions of species. And
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.520]   besides the sheer usefulness of animals, like a horse to get around once
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.320]   upon a time, or fish for food, or cows for milk, or worms for the soil, or sheep for
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   sacrifices and sweaters, besides the usefulness, the relationship between
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.320]   animals and man in the Bible seems to be one of God-saturated fascination. Listen
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.120]   to Job 39. "Can you hunt the prey for the lion or satisfy the appetite of the
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   young lions? Do you know when the mountain goat gives birth?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.640]   Do you observe the calving of the does? Who has let the wild donkey go free? Is
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.480]   the wild ox willing to serve you? The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   are they pinions and plumage of love? They're idiots!" That's my paraphrase. "Do
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.660]   you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? Is it by
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.640]   your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south?
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.920]   Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high?"
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.280]   That's Job 39. Or what about Job 12? "Ask the beasts, they will teach you. The birds
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   of the heavens and they will tell you. Or the bushes of the earth and they will
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.360]   teach you. And the fish of the sea will declare to you. Who among all these does
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.040]   not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?" Or Proverbs 30 24. "Four things
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.400]   on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise. The ants are a people
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.920]   not strong, yet they provide food in summer. The rot badgers are a people not
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs. The locusts have no king, yet they
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.000]   march in rank. The lizard you can take in your hands, and yet he dwells in kings
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.400]   palaces." Or the most familiar of all, Matthew 6. Jesus says, "Look at the birds
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   of the air. They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.880]   Father feeds them all. Are you not a much more value than they?" Same with plants.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.160]   Consider the lilies. So, without going to any more psychological detail, which I
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:53.600]   could, or spiritual detail, it seems to me that having a pet may fall into the
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:02.680]   category of God-saturated fascination and joy. So I do have a dog, and her name
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.640]   is Dusty. She's an eight-year-old golden doodle, and I could give reasons for why
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.400]   I think it's healthy for children to have such a dog, but we could do
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.640]   that another time, maybe. It's just Noel and me at home now, no excuse. Like, here
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   we are. So what is Dusty to me? Well, if Jesus says, "Consider the birds," etc., I say,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:37.600]   "Consider Dusty. She loves people more than food. She overflows with affection
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:46.240]   without testing your character first. She is indomitably happy, rain or shine. She
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.360]   holds no grudges whatsoever, no matter how she's treated. Her youth at eight
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:01.240]   seems to be renewed like the eagles. So, if you, Father, so taught a beast with no
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.440]   soul, no moral or spiritual capacities to live that kind of life, how much more
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.680]   should her master feel ashamed that even with the Holy Spirit I struggle to do
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   those things?" Yeah, thank you, Pastor John. And Jordan, thanks for the excellent question.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.480]   And everyone who's listening, thanks for joining us and listening in today and

[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.840]   of personal pain. Does my pain mean that God is angry with me for my sin? It's
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.120]   such an important question. It's coming up on Monday. I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.040]   Have a great weekend.
