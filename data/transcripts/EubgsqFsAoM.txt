[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   In John chapter 6, Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 hungry mouths with five loaves and two
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.280]   fish.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.640]   That same crowd hunted Jesus around the countryside and found him the very next day.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.760]   And in that second encounter, Jesus took an opportunity to teach them the distinction
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.600]   between the bread that perishes, like they got the day before, and the bread that never
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.280]   perishes, namely, Christ himself.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.240]   He pled urgently with them so strongly, he commanded them this in John chapter 6 verse
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.680]   27, "Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.740]   which the Son of Man will give to you."
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.200]   So the question is, should we labor and work to buy bread?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.960]   Should we work at all, or should we trust God to supply all of our bread needs supernaturally?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.440]   The answer to this question actually sheds much light on how we work and labor each day,
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.080]   as John Piper explains in his 2009 sermon.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080]   Here he is.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400]   What does the first clause in verse 27 mean?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.960]   Do not labor for the food that perishes.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.200]   Now, this is mainly for you believers, you who've eaten, you who've tasted, and you're
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.240]   wondering, "Okay, what's the implication of this for my job?
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.720]   My eight to five, my nine to six, my 60 hour a week job, my home making, my mothering,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.040]   my student life?"
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.680]   What does he mean, "Don't labor for the bread that perishes?"
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.160]   That's what he says, "Don't labor for the bread that perishes."
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.440]   And clearly, he means ordinary food, because that's what verse 26 says is the context.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.480]   "You are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of ordinary
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   food.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.720]   Don't labor for that kind of food."
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.120]   So what does that mean for us practically day to day?
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.320]   Two things it does not mean, and then what it does mean.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.400]   Number one, it does not mean quit your jobs.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.040]   Now we know that, and I could spend a lot of time proving this from virtually every
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.720]   book in the New Testament, we know that because the whole New Testament assumes and commends
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.120]   the dignity of work.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.840]   Ephesians 4:28, just one example, "Let the thief no longer steal, but let him labor,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.080]   doing honest work with his hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.400]   who is in need."
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.120]   Get to work, earn a living, a straight biblical understanding of what the lion's share of
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.840]   our life should be devoted to.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   Do your work.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600]   So it doesn't mean quit your jobs.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.040]   Second thing it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean don't bring home the bread.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.680]   I go and work, but don't do it for the bread that perishes.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.760]   Don't bring home the bread.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.720]   Don't bring home the check, put it in the bank, and then buy food.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   Don't do that.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.780]   It's not what it means.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.000]   And we know that for the same reason, and the example that you would think of probably
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.440]   is from Thessalonians, "If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat," which implies that
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.960]   the ordinary, now there are clear exceptions to that, right?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.880]   But the ordinary way of eating is to work, not mooch.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.160]   That's the ordinary way to get your food.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.880]   And the Bible everywhere assumes that and teaches that.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.120]   So two things, it doesn't mean quit your job, and it doesn't mean don't bring home the bread
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   when you put in your hours.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Bring it home.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Buy the food.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   Eat.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.000]   Stay alive so you can work.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.440]   That's biblical normal life.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   Well, what then does Jesus mean when he says, "Don't labor for the bread that perishes"?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   Well, the question I ask myself, trying to get at the deeper meaning of this is, what
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.760]   changes for this person who eats Jesus?
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   Okay?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   So you've got another kind of bread.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.600]   You've got normal bread that I'll eat in about two hours, bowl of cereal probably, and then
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.880]   there's spiritual bread.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   If I don't eat this, then I'll die and won't be able to preach anymore.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.040]   I think it's God's will that I should preach, and same thing for you.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.120]   And then we've got this other glorious, all-satisfying, eternal bread.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.240]   What changes here when you eat this?
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.480]   That's the question I ask myself, because that would help me know, "Okay, I'm going
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.760]   to work," just like you said, "going back to work after I got saved.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.420]   What changes?"
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.420]   And two things are real clear here.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.040]   This bread, it says, is food that endures to eternal life.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.560]   So the first thing that changes is a new chapter is added to your work life, eternity.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   Mark that.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.360]   A new chapter.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:34.380]   It's the last chapter, which means retirement isn't, whatever that is.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.000]   You got a new chapter added to your life called eternity, because if you eat this bread, your
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.040]   life doesn't stop.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   It goes on with joy forever.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.400]   That's the first thing that changes.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.480]   The second thing that changes is that this bread becomes your supreme treasure.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.760]   This bread, when you eat it and discover who He is, and over a lifetime, discover more
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.320]   and more of how deeply nutritional this is for souls that were made for God.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.880]   All other values go down, down, down, as He goes up, up, up.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   That's a huge change.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.840]   So you got a temporal change and a treasure change.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.560]   A chapter is added to your life and a treasure is added to your life, and the treasure is
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   more valuable than anything, and the chapter lasts forever and brings infinite happiness.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   So conversion goes like this.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.200]   Your eyes are opened.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.240]   You wouldn't have been able to put words on it like this, but that's why you're reading
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.160]   your Bibles.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.760]   Your eyes are opened.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:01.960]   You see Jesus Christ for who He is, crucified Son of God, risen, bred from heaven, righteousness,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.000]   forgiveness of sins.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   You see Him.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He starts to grow.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.400]   Even a little six-year-old can see, "Not what I need."
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.120]   And then you eat.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   You eat.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   You don't work for Him.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   You eat.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.240]   And you take Him into your life and He becomes your portion in your life.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.780]   It may have happened when you were a working man or a working woman.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.520]   So what happens then?
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.720]   You stay in your job, most of you.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   First Corinthians 7:24, "Let everyone stay in the job in which he was called, with God."
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.620]   So staying where you are is ordinary, normal, steady state Christianity.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.800]   And something about everything in that job changes.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.780]   That's carefully said.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.600]   I'm tempted to say, "Everything changes!"
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.420]   I will say that eventually.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:03.920]   But what I mean when I say it is, something about everything changes.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.020]   Christ dominates your mind as the supreme treasure.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:18.240]   And if things look bleak in work or at home, you remember you're going to live forever.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   So you go to work, not dominated by the desire for the bread that perishes or for the fear
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   of losing it.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.560]   You go to work knowing Him, trusting Him, treasuring Him, being satisfied in Him, with
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.160]   your heart set on making much of Him.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.560]   That's how you go to work now.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.040]   He's dominant in your mind.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.640]   He's dominant in your heart.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:50.260]   And every aspect of your vocation becomes a way of magnifying Him.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:57.680]   Living eternal life before you and snacking all day long on the bread of life will not
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.500]   make you a lazy worker.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.340]   It will not make you a shoddy worker.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.020]   It will not make you a gloomy worker.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:16.540]   You will bring zeal and excellence and joy to your work because you know Him, you trust
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.940]   Him, you treasure Him.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.020]   You want to make much of Him in all that you do.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.820]   You know that everything, everything done in the name of Jesus and for the glory of
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:36.220]   Jesus from the washing of the bathroom to the running of the boardroom will be rewarded
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:43.020]   forever with 10,000-fold undeserved joy.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   Powerful.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.700]   That was from Pastor John's sermon from November 15, 2009, titled, "Do Not Labor for the Food
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.700]   that Perishes."
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.820]   You can find the whole sermon at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.060]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John's in a recent message or an old
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.440]   message, send it to us.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.840]   Give me the timestamps from the audio of when the clip begins and ends.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.800]   Keep it to about five to eight minutes if you would.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.940]   Tell me why that clip especially impacted you.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.900]   Give me the story behind that.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.700]   And then send us your name and the closest city to you.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.540]   Email me all of that information to AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.380]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.340]   And if you would put the word "clip" in the subject line, that'd be easier for me to find
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.340]   it.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.080]   I'm always very interested to hear your favorite clips and what has most impacted you over
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.080]   the years.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.460]   And at the start of the week, we talked about leading someone to Christ.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.580]   We walked through those four treasure chests that Pastor John led us through.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.880]   Well next time when we return, we're going to talk to new believers who are just simply
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.780]   overwhelmed by all that the Bible has to say.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.540]   So where does one begin?
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.540]   Such a great question.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.620]   We need to address it.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.620]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.660]   Pastor John will be back with me in the studio on Friday.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.220]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220]   [Music]
