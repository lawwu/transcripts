[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention are to be found in the portion of
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.440]   Scripture that we have read at the beginning, namely in the Gospel according to St. Luke
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   in chapter 23, reading again verses 27 to 31.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.400]   Verses 27 to 31 in the 23rd chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.440]   And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.720]   and lamented him.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.480]   But Jesus, turning unto them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.400]   yourselves and for your children.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.640]   For behold, the days are coming in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren and
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.960]   the wombs that never bear, and the paps which never gave suck.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills cover us.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:12.680]   But if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.720]   I would like this morning, in other words, to consider with you what happened on that
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.480]   Friday morning, as we now call it, so long ago in that city of Jerusalem.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.640]   We are met together to consider that.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.160]   We are, as it were, gathered together as the crowd was there, this great company that we
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.360]   read of, a great company of people and of women following him.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.760]   We are looking at him and considering him and what happened to him.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.640]   Now this incident reminds us that there is one great question facing every one of us,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840]   therefore, at this moment.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200]   How does this incident affect us?
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.080]   That is what we have here, an account of how it affected certain people, and in particular
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.640]   these women of Jerusalem who were following him as he goes to his death.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.680]   That, I say, is the great question.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.720]   How does this affect us?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.480]   What does it mean to us?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   How does it strike us?
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640]   What does it do to us?
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.800]   There are surely two great dangers that always confront us on this particular occasion, two
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.960]   dangers of which, therefore, we have to be very wary.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:54.240]   The first is the danger of being solely interested in the events as such.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.000]   The danger of dramatizing, trying to repeat the various incidents that took place, the
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.960]   stations, as it were, on the way to the cross, a kind of dramatic interest, an interest in
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.320]   the spectacle, turning the whole thing, as it were, into a kind of tableau.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.120]   That is one danger, and the Church, often throughout the centuries and still today,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.400]   is ever in danger of doing that, of just looking at the details and dwelling upon them in a
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   mournful and in a sad manner, and just repeating them in a dramatized form.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.400]   That is one of the dangers.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.600]   But there is another danger which is the exact opposite of that, and that is the danger of
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.320]   being concerned only about the doctrine of the cross.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.080]   The first people are little interested in the doctrine, they are interested in the spectacle,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   some drama, something moving, something affecting in a general sense.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.560]   But these second group people, belonging to the second group, they are only interested
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.600]   in the doctrine of salvation, and they are not at all interested in the details, in the
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   facts, and in the events.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   To them the whole thing is intellectual.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.440]   Now I am trying to show that both these extremes are wrong, and that it behoves us always,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.240]   as Christian people, to combine these two things together.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.300]   We are meant to concentrate upon the facts and upon the details.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.880]   That is why we are met together.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.520]   That is why we observe this day at all.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   It reminds us of the historicity of these events.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   The Christian gospel, the Christian message, is not a mere teaching, not just a philosophy,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.600]   a way of life.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.440]   It is something that is based solidly upon facts, history, upon events, and we must never
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.960]   lose contact with the facts and with the events.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.100]   But at the same time, it is essential, of course, that we should understand their meaning
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.400]   and their significance, that we should allow them to take us and to direct us and to lead
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.180]   us to the teaching.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.800]   And what I want to try to do this morning is to show you how in this incident our blessed
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.360]   Lord himself does the very selfsame thing that I have just mentioned.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:39.420]   He teaches us how to look at and to face him and what happened to him on that occasion.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.160]   This in many ways is the last piece of public teaching that was delivered by our Lord.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.480]   From there on, he is on the cross and he answers questions, he makes statements.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   Here is his last piece of teaching, and this in itself is amazing and astonishing.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.440]   Let's glance at it for a moment.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.520]   Here we are told, "But Jesus turning upon themselves."
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   Now, what an amazing thing that is.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.280]   Here he is going to that death, knowing, as I am going to show you what that meant and
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.440]   what it involved and what it would mean to him, with his soul in an agony.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.000]   He has just been sweating drops of blood in the garden.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.640]   He is in an agony of soul.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:35.240]   He is facing this terrible crisis, facing a position that no human being ever has faced
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.760]   or ever can face.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   And yet the amazing thing is this, that in that very situation he turns.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.680]   He is concerned about these people.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.480]   He preaches to them, he teaches them, he thinks of them rather than of himself.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.040]   Oh, how typical and characteristic this was of him.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.760]   Always in the midst of his own problems and trials, his heart is concerned about others.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   And later, as we have been reminded, even in the agony nailed to the tree, he deals
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.760]   with the soul of that thief that was crucified by his side.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.960]   Now, here I say our Lord does this astonishing thing.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:30.160]   And the very fact that he did that teaches us that we must also learn how to face his
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.880]   death upon the cross and all that happened to him.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   The picture really puts it all before us in a very simple manner.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.440]   There followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   him.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   And he turns upon them.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.440]   And he rebukes them.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.120]   Why does he rebuke them?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.200]   Here's the lesson for us.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.160]   He makes it plain in his action, he makes it still plainer in his words.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.480]   What is he rebuking?
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.680]   Well, he is rebuking thoughtlessness.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.760]   Thoughtlessness.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.400]   He does it, of course, with gentleness.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.840]   But nevertheless, it is a rebuke.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.720]   He is rebuking this attitude that looks upon him and all that's going to happen to him
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.480]   without really thinking.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   It's a way of looking at him and what happened to him which is purely emotional, purely sentimental,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.400]   which doesn't trouble to really consider what is taking place.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.280]   It's so typical of a crowd, isn't it?
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.080]   They followed him in great company and the women in this special manner bewailing him
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.360]   and lamenting him full of grief and of sorrow as they look at him.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.160]   But that's the very thing he turns upon.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:01.520]   And he turns, I say, upon it because he wants to show the danger of thoughtlessness, or
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.560]   to put it positively.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:11.120]   His teaching about his own death is this, that we should approach it with thought, with
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:20.040]   contemplation, with intelligence, with understanding, that we must realize what is happening.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.120]   So you see, my dear friends, in a way we can describe this statement of his, this last
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.960]   piece of teaching of his, as a great appeal to us to think.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.920]   And if ever that message were necessary for the Church as well as for the world, it is
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.640]   at this present time.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.760]   This is no time for pictures, for tableaus, for dramatic representations, for mere singing.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:55.120]   The Church needs to think and to consider what he was doing there.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.680]   And indeed he tells us to so think about it that we shall end by weeping.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:08.600]   Weep not for me, he says, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   What does this mean?
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.720]   Well, you see, he is telling us so to meditate upon these things, so to think of them, so
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.960]   to realize their meaning and their significance, that we shall repent.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.160]   That's what the weeping means.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.480]   Now here again we are struck by a very remarkable thing.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.560]   Our Lord began his ministry and ended it on exactly the same note.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.000]   What was his first message?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.320]   Well, the first report we have of his preaching is found in the Gospel according to St. Mark
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.280]   in the first chapter and the fifteenth verse.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.480]   And this is what we are told, that Jesus began at that time to preach, and this is what he
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:58.240]   said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand."
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   Meditate and believe the Gospel.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.560]   The first note in his preaching is the note that called to thought leading to weeping,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.600]   to repentance.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.920]   And here is his very last message, his last piece of teaching.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   As on the way to the death he turns and addresses the daughters of Jerusalem, and what he says
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:32.560]   to them is what he said at the beginning, "Think, think, apply your minds, consider,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.160]   until you weep, until you repent."
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.960]   And this, my dear friends, is his message I feel to us this morning.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.640]   Yes, to us who are Christian people, as well as to the whole world.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.320]   To repent, why are things as they are?
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.200]   Why is the church as weak as she is at the present time?
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.840]   Why does she count for so little in this country and in the world?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.120]   Look at the whole state of the world.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   What's needed?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.480]   Well, what's needed this morning is repentance.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:13.000]   His first message, his last message, is the call to thought, to weeping, to repentance.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.560]   Let's work this out together briefly, under a number of headings which are suggested to
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.520]   us by this incident.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   Why did these women weep and lament for him, and because of what they could see happening
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.240]   to him?
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.960]   We must face that as our first question, because this tells us a great deal about him.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.360]   "Here they are, there of those in the crowd who have been shouting away with him, 'Crucify
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   him!'
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.480]   The Pharisees and scribes and the doctors of the law are filled with a bitter hatred
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.600]   against him, and it was they who brought about his death."
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.720]   But these people, and the women in particular, they weep and they lament.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   Why?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   Well, it's not difficult to answer that question.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   Part of the explanation is his own blessed person.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.920]   There was something about him that always attracted and impressed, especially the weak
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   and the suffering.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:17.600]   Publicans and sinners drew nigh unto him, little children were brought to him, the women
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.720]   gathered round him.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.920]   There was something about his person that drew people.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.680]   They felt they'd have sympathy and understanding.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   Something about his very personality.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.480]   You find it running right through the accounts of him in the Gospel.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.640]   He was different from all others.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.240]   There was something about his very appearance, his person, that had this effect upon men
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   and women.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.800]   But then, I've no doubt, there was something in addition to that, and still more important,
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   and it was this.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:56.320]   And no doubt, many of those people who were weeping and lamenting for him were women of
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   whom it was true probably that their relatives had perhaps been healed by him, or some of
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   their friends.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.360]   He'd gone about for three years doing good.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.560]   The blind received their sight, the lame walked, the lepers were cleansed, the deaf were made
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.040]   to hear, the dead are raised.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.320]   Peter describes him later in those terms.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   That was his ministry.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.160]   He went about doing good.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.760]   He relieved the suffering.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.080]   He had an eye of compassion.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   And doubtless, many of the relatives of these people had been the recipients of his kindness,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.160]   his love, his mercy and compassion.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:39.520]   Never had there been one who had done so much good, but here he is being led away to death.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   And their hearts were moved with pity and with compassion.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.040]   But still more striking, I believe, was their realization of his innocence and the utter
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.720]   injustice of his condemnation and of his crucifixion.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.280]   This is something which comes out in the entire record.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   Pilate realized he was guiltless, that he was innocent.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.800]   And it's important we should remember this particular aspect of this matter.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.720]   Pilate did his utmost to set him free.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.040]   Pilate's wife, you remember, still miserable.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.280]   She had a dream.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.380]   She was troubled.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.880]   She was in difficulties.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.840]   She knew his innocence.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.480]   Even Herod, we are told, was aware of his innocence and of his guiltlessness.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.280]   Pilate uses that as an argument.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.080]   He says, "I have examined him before.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.720]   You have found no fault in these men touching those things whereof ye accuse him."
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.080]   No, nor yet Herod.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.480]   They could find no cause of death in him.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.840]   The thief and the cross, this one of the two thieves realizes it.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.480]   He says, "We are being put to death and richly deserve to be put to death because
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.700]   we are guilty men, but not this man."
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.960]   And you remember the remark of the centurion after he died.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.800]   "Surely," he says, "this was a righteous man.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.680]   Certainly this was a righteous man."
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.600]   Well, now that is why these women were weeping and lamenting.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.760]   He was innocent.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.520]   And he said himself he was innocent.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.600]   There was no cause of death in him.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.720]   He defied anybody to bring a charge against him.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.000]   No one could do so.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.380]   They did their utmost.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.560]   But he was innocent.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.380]   He was guiltless.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:30.360]   He is the righteous son of God, and yet he is being led away to crucifixion.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.800]   It is unjust.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   It is unrighteous.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.160]   It is typical of the world.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:41.760]   Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:52.320]   This is a world in sin that is unjust and unrighteous, condemns the guiltless, and demands
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.220]   a murderer to be set free.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:02.040]   What a picture of the world, and what a picture of him in his holy innocence and absolute
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   righteousness.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.240]   But let's go on to what is more important.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.900]   Why does he tell the women not to weep?
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.960]   That is why they wept.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.360]   And in a sense, you see, it was fully justified.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:20.560]   And yet he turns and he says to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me."
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.840]   Now here this brings us to the very heart of his teaching.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.720]   The principle, of course, he lays down is this, that he doesn't need our sympathy.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.080]   He refuses to accept our sympathy.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.320]   He doesn't need our defense.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:45.080]   He doesn't call upon us this morning to condemn the injustice and the unrighteousness.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.240]   We note it, but we mustn't spend our time on that.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   There are people who have written books even in this century, dealing with this whole trial
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   to prove how unjust it was.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   There's no need to spend time on that.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   That's obvious.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   That is self-evident.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.880]   Don't stay with that, he says.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.720]   Here's the principle of his teaching, but let's analyze it.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   What do we find?
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:12.440]   Well, he tells them not to weep for him for this reason, because he had come into the
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   world in order to go to this.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.040]   That's why he, the son of God, had never come out of the glory into this world of time.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.140]   He wasn't surprised at his death.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:34.680]   He had come into the world in order to die.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.240]   He had talked about it.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.440]   Hadn't he said in his teaching, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.760]   so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.320]   He knew this.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.120]   He knew his Old Testament scriptures.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.320]   He knew all about the types and the sacrifices and the offerings, and he knew his relationship
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.960]   to them.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.800]   Hadn't he said on that occasion which is described in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel, "For
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   this hour came I into the world."
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.760]   You remember, he prays that.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.120]   "Father," he says, "what shall I say?
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.720]   Shall I say, 'Save me from this hour?'
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   No.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.240]   'For this hour came I into this world.'"
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.820]   We tend to forget this, my friends, in our sentimental thinking or lack of thinking.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:33.360]   We tend to forget that he came deliberately into the world in order to die.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   He's not taken by surprise here.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   He's not disappointed.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.560]   It was the whole object of the incarnation.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.560]   Now, this was stated later, of course, by the author of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.320]   who puts it in the second chapter in the ninth verse in these words, "We see Jesus, who was
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.240]   made a little lower than the angels."
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   What for?
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.880]   "For the suffering of death."
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.760]   That's why he was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.080]   That is why the word was made flesh, "For the suffering of death."
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   That he, by the grace of God, might taste death for every man.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:22.680]   So I say that this is one reason why he tells the women not to weep for him.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.480]   He knows that this was going to happen.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   Why?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.800]   On the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.880]   You remember when Moses and Elias appeared to him.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.440]   You remember the subject of the conversation.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:37.800]   What they talked about, our Lord, and Moses and Elias, was the exodus that he was about
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.920]   to accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.920]   So he's not disappointed, because he's been arrested and because he's going to the cross.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.720]   He had left the glory in order to go there.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:21:00.640]   But secondly, he tells them not to weep because he knows what was really happening.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.400]   They are weeping because of the cruelty of men, and the men were cruel.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.680]   There is no justification for them.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.240]   But our Lord knows that what is happening to him is not ultimately the action of men.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   It is the action of God.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.880]   Peter, you see, preaching on the day of Pentecost, puts it very clearly when he says, "Him being
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.000]   delivered by the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and by
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.520]   wicked hands have crucified."
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.800]   But remember, it was God's predetermined counsel and foreknowledge.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.880]   Our Lord knows at this moment, and that's why he rebukes the weeping and the wailing
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.520]   of the women, that he is about to fulfill that great plan of God for the redemption
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.840]   of men.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.720]   So I say, he tells us not to weep about this.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.360]   This is the carrying out of God's great plan of salvation.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.840]   John the Baptist had seen it in a flash of insight and inspiration at the very beginning
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   when standing that day with his two disciples, he pointed to him and said, "Behold the Lamb
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.320]   of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:19.960]   And he knew that he was the Lamb of God.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.400]   Hasn't he already spoken in the Garden of Gethsemane about the cup?
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.480]   "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by."
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.480]   What's this?
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:38.040]   "Oh, this is the way in which God is going to deal with the sins of men in order that
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.360]   he may forgive men.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:49.520]   The cup of the wrath of God, the cup of estrangement for a second from the face of God, the thing
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.800]   that made him sweat those terrible drops of blood there in that garden."
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   He knows.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.240]   He's not surprised.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.720]   They only see the action of men and the injustice.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.960]   He says, "Look beneath the surface, look deeper, it isn't men.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.600]   Can't you see what's happening?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.080]   I am God's Lamb.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.480]   I've come to give my life a ransom for many."
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.360]   He told them that the Son of Man, he said, "Is not come to be ministered unto, but
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   to minister and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   There's no surprise here.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.160]   He doesn't merely see what men are doing.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.920]   Men are doing it, but that's the superficial way of looking at all this.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.880]   That's the thing that makes us just weep and cry for him.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.320]   He says, "Don't.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   Stop.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   Realize what is happening.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:50.800]   Can't you see," he says, "that I am now going to do that which alone can save the
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.720]   souls of men.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.320]   Don't try to save me from this.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   Don't hold me back.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.560]   Don't feel sorry for me.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:06.480]   I am now about to fulfill the grand commission which sent me into the world at all."
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.960]   Or let me put that in these terms.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:18.760]   He tells us not to weep for him because he knows that now, in a few minutes, what is
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:26.480]   going to happen to him on that cross is going to glorify his heavenly Father in a way that
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   nothing else has ever done or ever can do.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.720]   He has already prayed, "Father, glorify thy name."
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.600]   That's with reference to the cross.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.960]   Look it up when you go home in John 12, 28.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.040]   He's speaking about his death.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.600]   "Father, glorify thy name."
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.800]   The reply comes, "I both have glorified it and will glorify it again."
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   What's he mean?
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:01.360]   Oh, what he means is this, that it is his death upon the cross that glorifies God as
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.960]   nothing else has done.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:08.560]   It's there and there alone you really see the love of God.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.520]   But remember, if you look at men only and think it's only the action of men, you don't
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   see it.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   You simply see God passively allowing men to do this to his Father.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.240]   That isn't what our Lord sees.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.320]   What he sees is this.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.400]   The Father glorifies himself.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.960]   He manifests his love.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   How?
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.160]   Well, he's given the answer many times over.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   Listen.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.760]   God so loved the world.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   How?
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   How did he love the world?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.520]   What is this love of God?
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   What do we know about it?
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:47.920]   Oh, God so loved the world that he gave, and gave, remember, to the death on the cross,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.360]   to the shame, the spitting, the scorn, and all that is true.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.640]   He gave his only begotten Son.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   That's it.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.840]   "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.160]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.920]   "If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.080]   shall we be saved by his life?"
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.560]   What he's saying is this.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.160]   And this is the glory of salvation.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.240]   That while we were yet sinners, God died for us.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.880]   God commendeth his love toward us.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.640]   God himself teaches us about it, shows it to us.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   This is how God says, "You are to look at my love."
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.320]   God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, while yet we were
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.000]   without due strength, Christ died for us, even while we were sinners, even while we
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   were enemies.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.400]   God delivered up his Son for us.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.200]   That's what you see on the cross.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.000]   "Oh, don't stop me, sir.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Don't keep me back.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.760]   Don't merely weep and lament and feel sorry for me.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.960]   I am going to manifest the glory of my Father."
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:13.520]   Or again take it in Romans 8, 32, "He, God, that spared not his own Son, but delivered
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.080]   him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   Don't merely look at men.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.000]   It's unjust, I know, but don't waste your time.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.440]   Don't spend your time there.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.240]   You'll just be sympathizing with Jesus.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:34.080]   No, no, I say, "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up."
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.960]   It's God that delivered him to the death of the cross, not men.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:47.200]   And in doing so, God has glorified his name, has manifested his great love toward us, in
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:54.240]   that though we are guilty, he gives his only begotten guiltless Son to bear the punishment
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.760]   of our sins in his own body on the cross.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.680]   There's nothing more wonderful in all history or ever will be than God's love toward us
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:17.480]   in giving his only begotten dearly beloved Son even unto death for us men and our salvation.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.440]   That's why he tells them not to weep and lament.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.240]   And then, of course, he knows the consequences of that.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.040]   What are the consequences of his death upon the cross?
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.560]   He knows.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.880]   He says it there again in that same passage in John 12.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.600]   "Now," he says, "is the judgment of this world.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.680]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.440]   And it happened.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:53.000]   On the cross, he defeats the principalities and powers, as the apostle puts it in Colossians
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   2, 14 and 15.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.320]   He has made an open show of them, triumphing over them openly, putting them to an open
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   shame.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   He knows all this.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:11.360]   There he is staggering to the cross, and he hears the weeping and the lamenting, and he
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   turns round and he says, "Weep not for me.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   Don't weep for me.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.640]   Don't be sorry for me.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.840]   Don't waste your sympathy and compassion on me.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.800]   Don't merely be filled with a sense of injustice and of the unrighteousness of it all.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   Don't weep for me."
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   Why?
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.680]   "Well, what I'm about to do, terrible though it is, is the judgment of this world, and
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.160]   the prince of this world is cast out."
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.380]   It is the moment of his greatest triumph.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:47.360]   It is the means whereby he reconciles men unto God and delivers them from this bondage
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.040]   and the serfdom and the slavery of Satan and of sin and of hell.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   It's the way in which he sets the captives free.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:05.300]   Well, that is why he tells the women not to weep for him.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.520]   But you notice his teaching doesn't stop at that.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:25.080]   Because of Jerusalem he says, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, weep for yourselves
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   and for your children."
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:35.200]   Now then, he says, if you want to weep, this should be the cause of your weeping.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.200]   Weep for yourselves.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   Why does he tell them to weep for themselves?
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.040]   He doesn't need any special critical acumen to answer that question.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.320]   Weep for yourselves, he says, because you evidently, obviously don't know who I am.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.800]   You just regard me as a good man and a kind man, a benefactor, a benevolent person, one
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.480]   who's gone about doing good and relieving suffering, healing the sick and giving beautiful
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.520]   teaching, and you're weeping because I'm a kind of another Socrates, another hero,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.680]   another prophet not appreciated by the world.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   You don't know, you don't understand, you're ignorant, you don't know who I am.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:29.640]   Weep because of your ignorance concerning me.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.040]   But wait a minute, there's another cause for weeping.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.480]   Weep because of your ignorance of yourselves.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.320]   You're weeping for me, you're not weeping for yourselves.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   Why are you not weeping for yourselves?
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:50.840]   Well, because you've never realized your sinful state and condition.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.760]   You're not thinking of yourselves, you're thinking of me and of the injustice.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.960]   You're very sorry for what's happening.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.240]   You've never thought about your own condition.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.680]   You've never thought about who I am and why I've ever come into the world, and you've
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.280]   never realized that because you've never realized the truth about yourselves.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.520]   You know nothing about your own guilt, you know nothing about your own helplessness before
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.600]   God.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.000]   You know nothing about your need of redemption.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.480]   You wouldn't be weeping for what's going to happen to me if you really knew what you
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.320]   need before you'll ever be forgiven and reconciled to God.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.400]   That would make you weep for yourselves and rejoice in this.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.080]   You don't know, you're ignorant.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:44.200]   And the world in its false sympathy and sentimental sympathy for the weak and helpless Jesus
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.080]   just doesn't know who he is, just doesn't realize its own guilt, its own need, its own
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:57.040]   helplessness, its own woe, its own emptiness.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.720]   Deep beneath the surface, he says, consider who I am, what's happening, why it must happen.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   Then you'll begin to weep for yourselves and not for me.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.160]   And then of course there was undoubtedly another element in this statement, a very particular
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   one.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:21.440]   He's addressing the daughters of Jerusalem, and in a sense he's saying this, it's a great
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.840]   dispensational statement if you like.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:31.480]   He is telling them about the calamity that's going to overwhelm them, they, their children,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.920]   their rulers, the whole nation, the city of Jerusalem.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:43.080]   Has he not already stood looking at the city and said, "Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killest
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.600]   and stonest of prophets and all the righteous men that have ever been sent unto you, how
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.640]   often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathers her chicks beneath her wings."
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:04.960]   But he would not, and now your house is left unto you desolate.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.320]   This nation was having its last opportunity in the Son of God.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.800]   God had raised up a whole succession of prophets to this nation and had sent them one after
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.720]   another as our Lord put it in a parable to the Pharisees and scribes, the parable of
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   the vineyard.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.520]   God had sent his prophets, they'd appealed, God had called them to repentance, he'd warned
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.120]   them but still they wouldn't listen.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.000]   At last he sends his Son, his only Son.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.560]   He says, "They've listened to my Son, so the Son comes and please calls them to repentance."
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:45.520]   They won't listen, and there's nothing left for them but retribution and punishment.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.320]   He is prophesying here in his teaching to the daughters of Jerusalem what happened in
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:57.480]   A.D. 70 when the Roman legionaries surrounded the city and sacked it, razed its buildings
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:03.760]   to the ground and cast out the Jews as a nation and as a people right out amongst the Gentiles
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.240]   where they've remained until this very day.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.320]   It is the fulfillment of what he'd said on one occasion when he said this, "The kingdom
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.680]   shall be taken from you and given to a nation bearing forth the fruits thereof."
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:24.400]   It is a judicial pronouncement upon the nation of Israel and what terrible things happened
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.000]   He said if they do this sort of thing in a green tree, what shall they do in the dry?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.720]   If the malignity of men is expressing itself like this in me, how will it express itself
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.400]   when it's poured out upon you and it was literally fulfilled?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:52.160]   He's warning them of the tragedy that is the lot of a nation that refuses and rejects him.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:58.200]   And beyond that, you see, he is making this solemn pronouncement, and it's for the whole
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.920]   world this morning.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   He is indicating the fate of all who die impenitent.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   That's what he is proclaiming.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.640]   "Don't weep for me," he says, "weep for yourselves.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.320]   Don't spend your time merely in talking about the injustice and the unrighteousness, the
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   cruelty of men, these politically minded people.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   Don't waste your time.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320]   Don't stop at that.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   Think.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.320]   Go down to the depths.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   Get understanding.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.960]   Realize this, that if you die without realizing why I had to die, if you die in your sins,
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.520]   you go on to eternal punishment."
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.960]   He'd been saying it right through his ministry.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:47.160]   Here it is again, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.800]   What for?
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   Why?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.560]   "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.440]   If a man doesn't believe in him, he does perish.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:06.560]   The only way to evade perishing is to believe in him, to realize who he is, and to realize
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.080]   why he died upon the cross, why he set his face steadfastly to do so, why he had to do
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.200]   so, why he tells people, "Don't weep for me.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   Don't be sorry.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   Don't hold me back.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   I must."
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.720]   "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:29.880]   But who doesn't believe of necessity does perish.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.520]   There is only one way of salvation.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:41.480]   It is in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:48.760]   A man who doesn't realize that he can only be saved because the Son of God has borne
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:55.440]   the punishment of his sins is a man who is lost and a man who dies in a lost estate,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440]   perishes.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.760]   There is no hope for him.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:03.920]   He goes on to eternal misery and happiness and torment in whatever form it may be.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.880]   That is the only thing that awaits him.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.040]   "Weep for yourselves," he says, "that you don't realize this.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:19.160]   Weep as you contemplate the torment, the agony, the suffering of a damned soul that has never
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:28.800]   seen the need of what I am about to accomplish on that cross that awaits me."
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.280]   That is why he tells them to weep for themselves.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:42.000]   Oh, it is this ignorance, our ignorance of God and his holiness and his righteousness,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.760]   our ignorance of the day of judgment, our ignorance of the responsibility of every human
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.960]   being made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.480]   The world doesn't know about it.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   It is ignorant.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   It doesn't think about it.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:03.120]   That is why it can sentimentalize about this injustice.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:11.080]   It doesn't know the truth about itself, its lost condition, its vileness, its blackness,
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   its hopelessness.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:21.640]   And it doesn't know this amazing act of God in not only sending his Son into the world,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:28.480]   but even sending him to the cross, laying our sins upon him, punishing, smiting, striking
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:35.920]   him that we might be delivered and forgiven.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.440]   Is there anything more tragic than that men and women shouldn't know about that?
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.000]   That is why they should weep.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.160]   That is why they should still weep.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.560]   Very well, my friends, let us close by facing the question ourselves.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:40:01.840]   How have you reacted to him and to what happened to him on that cross on Calvary's Hill?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.600]   What effect has his death had upon you?
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.800]   Let me put it plainly and bluntly.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.040]   Have you ever wept for yourself?
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   You have thought of him.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.000]   You have got your ideas about him.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.320]   You know about his death upon the cross.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   How do you regard it?
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   What is it?
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.000]   Is it just a tragedy?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.760]   Is it just a supreme pacifist?
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.740]   Is it just a great and a good man not understood by the world?
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.080]   Is that how you regard it?
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:39.240]   If it is, you are feeling sorry for him and not for yourself, and he rebukes you for that.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   That is of no value.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   You are wasting your sympathy.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   He doesn't need it.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   He doesn't want it.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   He doesn't need your defense.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.560]   There is only one test.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   Have you wept for yourself?
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:57.960]   Looking at him and what happened to him, have you seen yourself and have you wept with contrition?
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.440]   Do you know the love of God is as great as this?
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:10.600]   These very people who actually were responsible for his crucifixion, even they could be forgiven
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.280]   if they repented.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.960]   No man is condemned eternally for crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.520]   The physical act, even that can be forgiven.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.760]   There is only one cause of condemnation, and that is to reject the Son of God, not to realize
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.440]   who he is and your need of him and why he died.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.160]   To me it is a very wonderful thing to go from this chapter to the second chapter of the
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.960]   book of the Acts of the Apostles, and there you see more or less the same crowd and the
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   Apostle Peter filled with the Holy Spirit preaching to them and explaining what happened
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.840]   on the cross and Calvary's hill.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.360]   And you remember what happened.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.720]   In the midst of the sermon, men began to cry out saying, "Men and brethren, what shall
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   we do?"
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.040]   They were preached in their hearts.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.400]   And Peter replies saying, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.120]   the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   Holy Ghost."
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.920]   And you know, three thousand of them did it.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.120]   The people who cried away with him crucified him, the people in a sense responsible for
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.640]   his very death, the moment they repented, they're forgiven.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.360]   The moment they began to weep for themselves and to cry out in agony saying, "Men and
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.480]   brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.600]   They're all right.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:39.920]   They have thought, they have wept for themselves, they have realized who he was and why he died,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:46.160]   and they enter into the great salvation in the kingdom of God.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.120]   And that therefore is the one question for us at this moment.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.200]   Have you wept for yourself?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.320]   Have you ever realized your sinfulness?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.520]   Have you ever realized your vileness?
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.880]   Have you ever realized what an affront to God's sin is?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.440]   Have you ever realized what a terrible thing rebellion against God is?
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.920]   A pygmy man standing up against God, putting his own will instead of God's will, flouting
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.600]   God's laws, ridiculing him, living for himself, debasing the very nature that God had given
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   him.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.800]   Have you ever realized what an insult it is to the Holy God?
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:38.480]   The moment we begin to do that, we begin to weep with shame and sorrow.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.320]   Not only at our vileness, but at our unutterable folly.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.160]   Have you ever realized your helplessness?
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.280]   Have you ever realized that you can never put yourself right?
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.840]   Have you ever realized that all your righteousness is but as filthy rags in God's sight?
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:01.520]   Have you ever realized the uselessness of all that a man can do?
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   Have you ever realized that your case and condition are so desperate that it necessitated
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.840]   the coming of the Son of God out of the eternal glory into this world?
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   That's why he came.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.080]   If a teaching could save men, teaching would have been given.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.000]   It was given in the moral law, Ten Commandments, prophets.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Teaching can't save men.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.840]   Before a man can be saved, a single individual, the Son of God, must leave the courts of glory
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   and be born as a helpless babe, live as a man.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:39.080]   But above all, he must go to the cross, have our sins put upon him, bear their punishment
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.040]   in his own body, die and be buried in a grave, and rise again.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:49.000]   Have you realized that?
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.800]   Have you ever realized what it cost him in order that you might be forgiven?
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.920]   If you realize that, you won't weep for him, but you'll weep for yourself, that you are
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.960]   such a cab, such a fool, such a vile rebel, such a helpless, hopeless person, that he
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:11.280]   had to endure all that in your stead and for your sake.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:19.360]   But you know the thing that makes one weep above everything else, I think, is this, is
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:28.160]   his amazing love, that he did all that for us, miserable sinners as we are.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:35.080]   Proud, self-satisfied, self-righteous in our ignorance and blindness and darkness, talking
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.720]   about him and giving our opinions about God and judgment, deserving nothing but hell and
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:47.560]   eternal punishment, no goodness at all.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:56.440]   He so loved us, so loved us in spite of it, that he gave himself up.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.000]   That's the thing that broke the heart of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, and he
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   never got over it.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:13.920]   The Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.040]   And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:28.400]   Did he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued, amazing love?
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.280]   And can it be that thou, my God, hast died for me?
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   Oh, they've all seen it and they've all wept.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:45.680]   Charles Wesley, Isaac Watts joins him when I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.800]   of Glory died.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:58.680]   My richest gain I count but loss and poor contempt of all my tribe.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.200]   Miserable fool, wretched I am.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   What else can one say?
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.360]   Or have you ever felt like this upon the cross of Jesus?
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:19.920]   Mine eye at times can see the very dying form of one who suffered there for me.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:33.160]   And from my smitten heart with tears, from my smitten heart with tears, two wonders I
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:46.080]   confess, the wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:52.680]   I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:59.320]   I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of thy face.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:07.160]   Content to let the world go by to know no gain nor loss.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:22.240]   My sinful self, my only shame, my glory, all, thy cross.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.960]   Have you ever felt like this?
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.160]   Have you ever spoken like this?
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:36.440]   The wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:43.320]   But thank God, in spite of it, he died for me.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.280]   He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.160]   He died to make us good.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.360]   Beloved people, you've looked at him again.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.000]   You've seen him staggering up Golgotha.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.520]   How have you reacted?
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.760]   Have you wept for him only?
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:10.720]   Or have you wept for yourself?
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:22.000]   The moment you begin to weep for yourself, you'll begin to glory in him and in his wondrous,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   glorious cross.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Amen.
