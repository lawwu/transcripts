[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   60% of mainstream media funding
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.580]   comes from pharmaceutical companies.
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   So of course, we're seeing tons of ads
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.180]   that sort of create this insidious culture
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.120]   in our country that, like, medications are the answer
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.520]   for all health problems.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.420]   And medications can be very valuable,
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.120]   but what that does is it kind of, like,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.460]   subverts our attention away from more, like,
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.920]   natural mechanism of healing towards pharmaceuticals.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.000]   That's not legal in most other countries in the world.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.600]   The spend that goes towards ad on a children's network
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.400]   like Nickelodeon is from ultra-processed foods.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540]   That's not allowed virtually anywhere else in the world.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.940]   We have federal agencies in the U.S., like the FDA,
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840]   where 75% of their budget
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.540]   is coming from the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.220]   Not to mention, there's dozens and dozens
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.820]   of chemicals allowed on our food and in our food in the U.S.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.680]   that are just straight-up banned in the EU.
