[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   And Danielle says, how can I stop my digital minimalism principles from going out the window
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.640]   after having a baby?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.440]   So she talks about, I'm going to condense this some, um, she's on her phone a lot more
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.680]   because she's taking pictures to send to her family.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.400]   And there's also useful things for her baby that she uses on the phone, like controlling
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.480]   the lights or the white noise in the room.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.960]   And reading, she really emphasizes reading when you're doing those feedings in the middle
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   of the night.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.840]   And then she ends up, I'm quoting her, quoting her here, doom scrolling, the guardian online
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.200]   at 5:00 AM to check the latest COVID news, et cetera.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.840]   All right.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.200]   She says, uh, the bad phone habits have now set back in like rot.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.320]   My phone seems like the most efficient way to stay occupied during this long feeds.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.360]   I don't want to give myself too much of a hard time, but I don't want my son pretty
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.600]   much ever to see me on my phone.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.120]   Once he's old enough to be able to recognize it, you know, what do I do?
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.240]   Well, Danielle, first you're right to go easy on yourself when you're in the infant stage.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.000]   I mean, anything goes survival, not a time to be really on yourself about your phone
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.960]   habits on exercise and food on, are you properly socializing with people?
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   It's a little bit of an all hands on deck, at least until you sleep train.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.600]   And I do hope you sleep train Danielle, because you got to balance the needs of the baby with
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000]   your own.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.920]   One concrete thing I'll just offer from our own experience is when we had our first, my
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.040]   wife had the same issue with the phone reading during the late night feeds.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600]   So she bought a Kindle paperwhite.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.440]   That's when the pin Kindle paperwhites first came into our lives.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.520]   So you could read a book during the feeds and the paperwhite has its own built-in backlight
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.920]   that is not disturbing.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.320]   It doesn't fill the room with light.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.840]   It's not going to bother the baby.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.360]   It doesn't change you into, Oh my God, it's daytime.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   And so the Kindle paperwhite is not a bad idea for distraction during late night feedings.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   That is not going to send you down a doom scrolling rabbit hole.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.720]   The other thing she innovated in our household was also like the, uh, the go basket next
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.800]   to every place you might feed.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.880]   It had all sorts of various things like snacks, water bottles.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.960]   I'd read, I get, you know, fresh ice water and good insulated things before the night,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.120]   um, towels, you know, for the mess.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.880]   He had these go baskets next to all the places you would, you would feed and see if your
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.520]   paperwhite and all the stuff you need, you just got to make that as easy as you can.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.760]   I like your idea by the way of not having your kids see you on the phone all the time.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   It doesn't matter with an infant.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.800]   It doesn't matter even with a one year old or two year old.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.540]   I do think it matters.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.120]   We should talk about this more as a culture.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.760]   When you're talking about a five year old, a seven year old, a 12 year old, they see
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.840]   you on your phone all the time.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.920]   You can have a hard time convincing them they shouldn't do the same.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.660]   (upbeat music)
