[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.680]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.940]   and each week I sit down with the world's best experts
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.260]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.860]   that shape their success.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.700]   A couple days ago,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700]   I had a fascinating conversation with Tad Fallows,
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.260]   and we talked about how high net worth investors
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.920]   manage and invest their money,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.420]   including their asset allocation percentages,
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.040]   and a deep dive on alternative assets.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.780]   So if you wanna check that out or get more context on Tad
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.260]   and the community of high net worth investors he runs,
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.180]   definitely listen to that episode.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.800]   But today, I wanted to release a little bonus episode
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600]   with the rest of that conversation,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.620]   which is all about how he thinks about money and kids,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.180]   things like allowance, college savings,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.020]   sharing family finances,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.080]   as well as a real estate tax hack and his recommendations
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.460]   if you're ever in his hometown, Dallas.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.680]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.600]   Science has shown that being charitable
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.960]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.440]   They're a not-for-profit community
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.580]   built around a new modern way to give,
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.520]   and they have a mission I think we can all get behind,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.600]   helping people be more generous more often.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.320]   because they offer an account that makes it easy
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320]   to put money aside for charity.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.340]   You can make a one-time contribution,
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.840]   or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.000]   and all your contributions are tax-deductible,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.040]   except you don't actually have to know
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760]   exactly where you wanna give the money right away.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.160]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.400]   and invest that money into stocks or even crypto
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.080]   so it can grow tax-free
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.680]   and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   Then, whenever you're ready,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   you can give to any of more than 1 1/2 million charities,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.300]   schools, or faith-based organizations
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.140]   in a matter of seconds.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.640]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.620]   if you wanna start giving today,
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.260]   and for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.780]   you can get a free $25 to give
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.700]   to the charity of your choice.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.380]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.500]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.120]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   So I love having an easy way
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.080]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.940]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.200]   for this episode.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.520]   what all the hype was about,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.980]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.160]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.360]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.720]   and energized for the day,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.480]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.320]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.120]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.300]   or artificial anything.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.080]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.600]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.520]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.440]   All you have to do is visit
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.120]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.000]   to take ownership over your health
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.040]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.480]   I am curious about another type of financial education,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.920]   which is how you're thinking about
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.440]   sharing all of this knowledge with your kids,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.580]   because mine right now at two and five months,
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.640]   we're not really talking about it a lot.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.720]   A guy I know, Rob Phelan,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.600]   has this awesome book called "Emma's for Money"
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.700]   that we bought for my daughter.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.380]   So it's like an alphabet book,
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.400]   except each page is talking about an aspect of money.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.800]   And my daughter knows that the piggy bank has money
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.000]   and that the money buys things.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.680]   And that's about as far as we've gotten.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.320]   You're further on the journey.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   How have you thought about trying to make sure your kids
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.920]   both understand all of this
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.280]   and are equipped with the knowledge,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.560]   but also, I went to a conference recently
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.720]   and there was a group of people that said,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.800]   "How do we raise kids that aren't entitled?"
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.720]   Have you thought about that and what are you doing?
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.900]   Yeah, I love this question.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.960]   Of course, I'll start with the comment
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.360]   that I don't have all the answers here,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.160]   but if I look at myself
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   and actually all the members of our community,
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.760]   I'd say, what is the number one problem
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.520]   that most of them are struggling with?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.440]   It's this question of, as you're saying,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.680]   what's the right way to raise kids in regard to money?
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.080]   And I might put that into two groups.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.560]   One, you talked about how to make sure you're instilling
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   them with the right values
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.600]   and not to take things for granted, not to be entitled.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.920]   And then the other one is just practically
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.800]   how you get them sort of the information
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.600]   and knowledge about it.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.040]   In the world of not being entitled,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.940]   don't have a full answer there, but a few things.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.660]   In general, I would say that communication
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.260]   and honesty and transparency,
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.500]   I think is the best way to go.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.780]   So my kids are a little bit older, they're seven and 11,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.900]   and we've been trying to do this throughout.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.740]   So in terms of making sure that they value money,
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.460]   of course, they can see that we have a nice house.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.860]   If we wanna go on vacation, we go on vacation.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.140]   But my wife and I are transparent
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.700]   when we talk about decisions we're making.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.740]   Like we bought a new car recently
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.780]   and my son was asking, "Well, why didn't we get a luxury car?
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.980]   "Why did we get a Hyundai?"
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.340]   And it was that we didn't have the money for it.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.120]   I said, "We could if we wanted to buy a fancier car,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.880]   "but that's just not important to us.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   "And other things that we spend our money on
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   "are more valuable to us."
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   I used actual numbers with him.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.880]   Okay, here's how much a Mercedes would cost,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.400]   here's how much the Hyundai costs.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.560]   This one seems nice to me.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   They both get from A to B.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.280]   So just this idea of communicating,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.360]   no matter how much or little money you have,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.520]   there are trade-offs.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.280]   Whether it's whether to buy the coffee at Starbucks
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.360]   versus making it at home versus do you wanna fly private
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.840]   versus do you wanna fly commercial?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.620]   I personally have not moved beyond the idea
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.460]   of flying economy.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   I can't get my head around flying first class.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.380]   So the kids actually, it de-mysticizes it.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.700]   They see this as something that mommy and daddy talk about
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.020]   and they think about these trade-offs
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.780]   and I think that kind of gives them exposure to it.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.660]   In terms of how to sort of educate the kids
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.420]   on money and how it works,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.060]   is something where I wouldn't say
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.820]   that we've done a lot of things right in parenting,
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.900]   but this is one where I feel like
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.000]   we have done a pretty good job of it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.380]   I think the fundamental thing is your kids are interested
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.040]   in everything that you're interested in
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.400]   and everything you do.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.280]   So again, my wife and I just talk transparently
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.120]   about our jobs and when I'm looking at an investment here,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.760]   I will put it in words that will make sense
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040]   to a seven-year-old or make sense to an 11-year-old,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.880]   but I'll tell them,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.040]   "Hey, we're looking at this whiskey aging fund
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.880]   "and here's how it works.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.640]   "You're buying stuff that this factory makes
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.560]   "and you're holding onto it
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.100]   "and you think you can sell it for more for later.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.480]   "And does this seem like a good deal?"
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.320]   And asking them,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.960]   "Hey, what would you be worried about on this deal?
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.380]   "How do you think it might not work out?
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.180]   "Why do you think it does make sense here?"
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.960]   Just that open talking about it
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.760]   of not having money be a taboo.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.960]   Our son was asking about how we bought a house
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   and how we decide which one to buy.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.280]   And we didn't make up numbers saying,
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.360]   "Okay, let's pretend a house costs $100."
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.000]   We talked about the actual prices of that
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.220]   because they are sooner than we want or realize
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.160]   gonna get access to the actual numbers.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   So versing them those real numbers is super helpful.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.220]   And then the other thing we've done
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.680]   is actually just tactically in the world of investing.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.080]   Each kid, as soon as they were born,
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.800]   I opened a brokerage account for them.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.040]   So this was separate from their 529 college savings,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.000]   but just a brokerage account
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.920]   to buy individual shares of stock.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.680]   And then for every birthday and Christmas and Hanukkah,
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.580]   they each get to pick out one stock
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.480]   that they're interested in.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.680]   Starts when they're little kids, like,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   "Okay, how about Mattel?
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.560]   "Or how about Disney?"
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.440]   Or something like that.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.880]   And I just print out a cute, goofy looking stock certificate
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.720]   and they think that's semi-cool.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.520]   But then, especially my son, now he's 11, has gotten older.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.880]   He's expressed interest in this.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.420]   And so we will actually talk about particular companies
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.780]   and say, "Hey, your birthday is coming up.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.800]   "What do you wanna look at?"
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.180]   And depends, sometimes he'll be,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.100]   he wants a share of stock in the company
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.600]   where my wife works or something like that.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.560]   And sometimes he'll say, "Well, which one's growing faster?"
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.440]   And start to do a junior version of analysis on them.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.920]   And it's not like this is his passion.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.160]   He may show no interest in it for two months,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.540]   but then the brokerage statement will come,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.000]   he'll look at it, he'll read it.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.120]   And the cool thing about kids is
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.840]   if he's getting 75 cents in dividends from some companies,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.280]   like, "Wow, I just got 75 cents I didn't work for."
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.120]   For a grownup, you might say,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.140]   "Hey, who cares about the 75 cents?"
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.860]   But for a kid, actually those small numbers
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.440]   are an exciting amount of money.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.120]   And it's a way to sort of start getting them
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.120]   that exposure there.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.000]   And they can get those little wins.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.640]   And they actually then see that continuity
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.520]   where a year from now, in two years, in five years,
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.960]   he's seen those same shares that he got
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   for his third birthday.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.040]   Now it is eighth birthday or his 13th birthday.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.180]   He's seen those there.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.760]   If he puts on dividend reinvestment,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.480]   he's seen those numbers get bigger.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.840]   And just sort of, at least for him,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.800]   I saw this light bulb go out of these dividends.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.040]   "Hey, I didn't do anything.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.200]   And now I got this money here."
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   I think he sort of gets the value.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.280]   We also nudge them in that direction
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.520]   where they get an allowance.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.360]   And we give them the option of,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.560]   "Hey, you can spend it on whatever you want to.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.400]   It's your money.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.360]   It's your choice.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.240]   But if you donate to charity,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.320]   we're going to match that 100%.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.880]   And if you invest it, we're going to match that 100%."
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.160]   And so the kids, they spend some on trash,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.680]   but I would say most of it they choose to donate or invest.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.840]   And they see the value of that 100% investment.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.320]   And it gets it compounding pretty fast.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.240]   I've also found, especially as they get older,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.320]   it's been a nice discipline tool.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.640]   Every parent, discipline is such a challenge.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.960]   You don't want to yell at your kids.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.980]   You lecture them, you give them consequences,
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.080]   timeouts, takes things away, et cetera.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.680]   But for a certain class of misbehavior,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.040]   this can actually be really effective.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.360]   So my son and I were at Boy Scouts a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.080]   He was throwing around his Boy Scout book
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.760]   and he accidentally threw it up in the rafters
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.040]   and it got stuck there.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   And so I was being like so frustrated with him.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.320]   Like, "Why'd you do that?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   It's going to cost $25 to buy a new Boy Scout book."
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.280]   And then I realized, "You know what, Jack?
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.680]   You got to spend the $25 to buy that Boy Scout book.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   I told you not to throw it around.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.480]   You knew that was the wrong thing to do.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.160]   It factually costs $25.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.600]   We can look on Amazon here and saying getting a new book
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.820]   is costing $25.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.760]   That's coming out of your account there."
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.320]   And so that was, I would say, a very fair consequence.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.600]   It was just a natural consequence of what he did,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.720]   but it really reinforced it.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.980]   He has not done that same thing again when he realized,
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.560]   "Hey, I have to pay out of pocket for this."
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.120]   And of course, he destroys our sofa.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.640]   We're not going to charge him thousands of dollars for that.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.680]   But you get these sort of small classes of things
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.620]   where you can actually just make them more responsible,
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.160]   at least with material things,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.240]   by making them live with the consequences when they act
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.120]   irresponsibly.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.960]   - I like it.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.440]   I feel like I got a lot of thinking to do
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.480]   before we get there.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.680]   I will ask in case you've thought about it,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.600]   have you thought much about college savings and 529s
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.960]   versus just keeping something in a little bit more liquid,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840]   less restrictive place?
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.580]   - Yeah, I looked at this a lot when they were born,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.840]   and I've just started put on autopilot since then.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.100]   The math I did when they were born was basically,
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.100]   if you put $1,000 a month from day one into a 529 plan,
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.620]   assuming some reasonable rate of return,
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.700]   that's going to more or less cover the cost of college
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.540]   when they get there.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.460]   Since that was seven, 11 years ago,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.740]   it's probably a higher number today.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.140]   Maybe it's 1,200 bucks that you need
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.540]   to put a month into that.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.060]   But I just started that from day one,
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.820]   and those accounts have been building up.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.460]   The upside to 529s, they're great from a tax perspective.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.420]   You put the money in untaxed at the beginning,
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.740]   but basically it grows untaxed.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.100]   The dividends are untaxed, capital gains are untaxed.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.980]   And when you take it out,
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.860]   as long as you're spending it on education,
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.500]   and there's a very broad set of things
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.700]   that count as education,
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.540]   there's no taxes ever when you're taking it out.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.900]   So it's great there.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.380]   The only quote risk is that you actually overfund it
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.920]   and maybe your kid doesn't go to college
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.100]   or they get a full scholarship
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.180]   or they go to an inexpensive in-state school
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.860]   and you've got too much money in there.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.760]   I think it's a really pretty small problem.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.140]   One reason is that you can take that money out
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.060]   and just pay a penalty,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.700]   but if it's been compounding for 20 years,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.060]   you've probably done better than the penalty anyway.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.860]   Or if you're fortunate that you've got extra money
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.300]   and there's money left over in there,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.880]   you can always just repurpose that to a new beneficiary.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.420]   So in theory, you could make your grandkids
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.380]   the beneficiary of that.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.060]   And then you've done your kid's college savings
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.300]   on their behalf for them.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.500]   I have probably overfunded what we need to have in there,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.620]   but just in the idea of that,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.780]   the downside is pretty small
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.460]   and the upside of not having to worry about it
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.740]   is pretty significant.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.780]   There's other things you can do in terms of also
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.460]   putting money in trust for your kids
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.540]   and UTMA accounts, et cetera.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.520]   I wouldn't say I have the exact answer there,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.900]   but for the 529s, I think just picking a number
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.380]   and consistently putting in every month
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.860]   is kind of a no-brainer if you can afford to do it.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.980]   Someone sent me,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.540]   I can't even remember the name of the website
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.600]   or I'd share it,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.660]   but this guy who basically teaches a course
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.940]   or does consulting.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.180]   I can't figure out how legitimate it is,
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.140]   but it's a bunch of hacks and a series of tactics
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.200]   to basically offset the cost of college.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.140]   And it seemed like it was kind of asset location
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.820]   meets scholarship eligibility and financial aid
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.660]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.520]   I'm thinking of doing an episode on college savings
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.020]   in and of itself and I'm trying to do some research now.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.980]   So stay tuned if I learned anything interesting.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.900]   And if I don't, then that means there's not really
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.060]   any interesting tactics to learn from.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.500]   - Yeah, and I will say if you send your kids
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.240]   to private elementary school,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.420]   you will question why you're saving for college.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.900]   It costs just as much to send them to a private elementary.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.260]   Fortunately, our kids are going to a public school now,
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.380]   but when they were previously going to a private school,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.960]   I really questioned why there was all this hoopla around it
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   when it costs just as much before that.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.800]   - That was kids.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.180]   Are there any other areas of life,
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.260]   things you've picked up, tactics you want to share,
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.480]   tips, hacks, before we take off?
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.260]   - Sure, I think one that does not work for everybody,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.660]   and I don't personally do this,
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.280]   but if you can make it work, there's a huge upside too,
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.960]   is having you or your spouse
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.420]   become a real estate professional.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   And what that means is whoever is a real estate professional
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.540]   needs to spend 750 hours or more,
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.700]   and at least half or more of their business hours
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.660]   doing real estate.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.500]   It's pretty broad variety.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.460]   It can be a contractor, a real estate agent,
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.260]   managing your properties, et cetera.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.780]   But if you do that,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.180]   then all of your paper losses on real estate
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.820]   are actually deductible against your ordinary income.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.200]   So if you have one spouse,
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.600]   say your wife is a lawyer earning a lot of money
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.000]   or a doctor earning a lot of money,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.240]   and you can qualify as a real estate professional,
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.540]   you can actually cancel out her income
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.200]   with your paper losses on real estate.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.960]   I don't know that I think this is good public policy,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.880]   but if it's something you can do,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.560]   it's a real savings for your portfolio.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.400]   - Awesome.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.260]   Unfortunately, no real estate profession here,
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.780]   although maybe that definition gets wide enough one day,
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.720]   it'll qualify.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.900]   I know you love all this stuff.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.020]   This conversation has been great.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.020]   We've had other ones before.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.580]   Are there other places online that you consume content?
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.600]   You've got Long Angle, you've got this podcast, of course,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   but other resources, sites, blogs, people you follow
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.460]   to stay on top of all of this?
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.300]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.780]   There's a couple websites I like.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.420]   Mr. Money Mustache, I'm sure you're familiar with,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.060]   a lot of your listeners probably are.
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.020]   He was one of the ones that initially got me into this idea
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.260]   of a lot of the investing and I guess financial hacks.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.180]   It's fairly different from some of the stuff I do,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.980]   but I find him a very entertaining writer
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.920]   and a lot of interesting content there.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.900]   There's also the Fat Fire Forum
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.400]   on which Mr. Money Mustache is all about extreme frugality.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.180]   Fat Fire is more around financial independence,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.340]   but spending a lot of money.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.980]   So between those two, you kind of get a yin and yang of it.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.100]   In terms of podcasts,
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.980]   there's probably three that I really like.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.900]   One is the Odd Lots podcast
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.820]   by a couple of the Wall Street Journal reporters.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.660]   It covers different economic topics
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.880]   in a really good degree of detail, sort of like yourself.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.820]   There's one called Money for the Rest of Us
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.820]   that, again, he'll pick sort of one generally investing
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.240]   concept or asset class and really go deep on it
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.460]   for half an hour or so.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.140]   And I've learned quite a bit from that one.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.580]   And then there's one that won't appeal to all listeners,
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.460]   but it's called The Business of Family.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.540]   And especially people who are in a demographic
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.700]   of having a family office or a family company
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.620]   and having quite a bit of assets
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.540]   in some company like that.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.220]   Every episode, he interviews the sort of person
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.180]   leading one often multi-generational family company
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.900]   and talks about what they do to pass values and wealth
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.340]   and practices and other things across generations
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.260]   and how to run these family companies.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.540]   I'm not personally in that situation,
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.740]   but I just find it fascinating to hear
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.760]   what some of these very successful families have done there.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.080]   So those were three that I would point you to.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.920]   - Great.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.700]   We always end up asking you to pick a place
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.020]   that you're pretty familiar with
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.860]   and share a few recommendations,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.780]   something to do, eat, drink.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.620]   What's your spot?
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.020]   - So I live here in Dallas.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.540]   I've lived here about seven years.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.920]   Anybody who talks to me knows
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.500]   I'm basically the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.340]   I love it here.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.020]   So I'll talk about a couple of things with Dallas.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.240]   You know, if I were looking at a really nice day in Dallas,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.820]   I'd probably go for a walk down the Katy Trail,
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.300]   which is our rail trail here.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.620]   There's a nice place called the Katy Trail Ice House.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.780]   There's not great food there,
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.340]   but the atmosphere is awesome.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.020]   And one of those places where you can get a margarita
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.860]   the size of your head.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.620]   So that's a fun kind of people watching on the trail.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.460]   And then where I'd probably go,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.560]   what might surprise people about Dallas
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.660]   is the symphony here is actually phenomenal.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.060]   I'm not a very cultured person
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.700]   and not historically into the arts,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.540]   but we went one time to the symphony
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.380]   and I absolutely love it.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.820]   We became season ticket subscribers
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.460]   after the concert hall was designed by I.M. Pei.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.060]   And apparently it has top 10 acoustics
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.580]   in the world among symphony halls,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.060]   given the way they designed it.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.380]   I would definitely recommend anybody
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.340]   who has a free Thursday, Friday, Saturday night
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.000]   here in Dallas checks out the symphony.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.840]   - This is awesome.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.700]   I really appreciate you being here.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.140]   - All right, thank you for joining
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.660]   for this short bonus episode.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.340]   If you have any thoughts, feedback,
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.300]   or questions for me about anything,
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.540]   especially because I'm prepping
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.740]   another listener question episode soon,
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.580]   shoot me a DM or email me chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.180]   Okay, that's all for this week.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.140]   See you next week.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.200]   you
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:01.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
