[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.600]   Radical personal finance episode 12
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.280]   How long do you guys would you work how would you decide not to work you gonna work forever
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.680]   Have you thought about that at all
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.680]   No, no Warren is much more fixed in his mind about what he's going to do about it
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.920]   And that's why when when people say well
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   We ought to write a story about who's going to succeed Warren Buffett
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.400]   I say, you know, it's just kind of ridiculous to say that because he isn't gonna retire and if he doesn't retire if he
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.200]   Say he runs Berkshire ten years more the whole set of people who might succeed him will have changed and so it's ridiculous
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   To write a story about that. No, I agree
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.280]   The
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.120]   You know, I I'm having the time of my life at some point your mind goes
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.880]   I mean and I've told my my kid I think was I think it was David Ogilvie that says
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   Develop your peculiarities when you're young that way when you get older, they won't think you're going gaga
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.920]   So I did that I followed that advice, but my children will come in to me and some point
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.840]   I've told all three to come in at the same time and tell me you're going gaga daddy
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.260]   And and if only one of them comes in there out of the will so they have to come in
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.640]   But it's the truth is
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.200]   In terms of managing money or even managing a business
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.680]   Depending on the nature of the business and the way it's managed
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.360]   Age really isn't much of a deterrence if you turn everything else
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.480]   I mean, you know, I'm in terms of I hand I coordination balance all kinds of things
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.400]   but in terms of getting the most out of other people which is
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.240]   What my job is and in terms of allocating capital so far it hasn't been a deterrent, you know
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.760]   Who knows what happens next week? It's but you have a contingency plan in terms of governance. Oh, it's total
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   I mean it if I died a night tomorrow morning
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.880]   There will be a CEO name every board knows exactly who it is if for some reason that person's unavailable
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.320]   They know another one. I mean, it's what we spend a majority of our time on
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.240]   You you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's totally true and the reason is
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.940]   Is because it's so hard that if you don't any rational person would give up
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.260]   It's really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.080]   So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, you don't really love it
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.360]   You're gonna give up and that's what happens to most people actually if you really look at
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.320]   At the ones that ended up, you know being successful on quote in the eyes of society and the ones that didn't oftentimes
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.880]   It's the ones that are successful loved what they did so they could persevere when you know when it got really tough
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   And and the ones that didn't love it quit because they're sane
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640]   Right who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320]   so it's a lot of hard work and and it's a lot of worrying constantly and
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.120]   If you don't love it
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.840]   You're gonna fail so you got to love it. You got to have passion and I think that's the high-order bit
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   the second thing is
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.360]   You've got to be you've got to be a really good talent scout because no matter how smart you are
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.720]   You need a team of great people and you've got to figure out
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.280]   how to how to size people up fairly quickly make decisions without knowing people too well and
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.560]   Hire them and you know see how you do and refine your intuition and be able to to help
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.480]   You know build an organization that can eventually just you know build itself
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.080]   Because you need great people around you
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   I want to talk about the fact that this is my last keynote
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.720]   and
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.760]   It's middle of this year in July
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.760]   That I'll move from being a full-time employee at Microsoft to working full-time at the foundation
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.560]   As you heard and so this will be the first time since I was
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.240]   17 that I won't have my full-time Microsoft job
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.440]   And I'm not really sure what that last day is going to be like
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.080]   You know it could be a bit strange. You know what do you do on your last day?
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.800]   So I asked some friends
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   to help me prepare for that and so
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   We got together and did a little video
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480]   So let's take a look at that
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   It is a day the industry never thought would come join us all day as we report on Bill Gates last full day at
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   Microsoft
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.840]   It's been in the planning for the past two years
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.440]   He'll still be active as chairman. It's hard to believe it's really here
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.920]   Yeah, I think Bill's ready for his last day
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   He's worked pretty hard saved a little bit
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.320]   He is
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.920]   Completely focused I
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.580]   Mean Bill's been going all out for more than 30 years so not having a completely full schedule every day
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.960]   It's been a little well
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.600]   interesting
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.640]   Never doubt the magic of software
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   That's right listen to tobacco
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.640]   You know after all these years he's finally taking work-life balance seriously. He's even got a personal trainer
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.800]   All right, that's good one in a row
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.240]   And you keep this up you're gonna get sexist man alive next year, bro
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   That's good for the set man you won't let it go you want to keep going well
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.560]   Am I am I ready to take my shirt off um not yet?
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.760]   Yourself come on back lean a little forward just think hi hi to the sky you and I
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.600]   right now
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.840]   Yeah, Bill's always been a bit of a ham, but more importantly it's the creative risk he takes that really set him apart
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.560]   Big pimpin I'm Bill T
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.480]   Big pimpin yeah, you know
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   I
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   Hey, let me let me get one thing straight with you you can retire and then unretire
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.240]   Exactly got keeping guessing. Thanks Jay. No I was great
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.520]   Not so much
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.440]   Somebody got talent it's horrible
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.760]   Hello bill yeah, yeah, I'm a little busy here
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:14.000]   Dude wasn't that the craziest rip you ever heard
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.920]   We've talked about this before
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.680]   We're full up in the bag
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.200]   Positions are filled
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   I know I know, but I can't just replace edge because you got a high score on guitar hero
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:44.520]   Bill's always had a passion for music and as long as it's not my music. I'm fine with that
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:55.520]   Bill's always been a big fan of the movies, but he's probably gone a bit too far with this whole audition real thing
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.240]   Who are you expecting Superman?
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   Well what money can't buy
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:19.120]   Yeah, I just watched it yeah look we all know it's all about casting anyway, right I know Steven I can't it's just I
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.160]   can't play Bill Gates, it's
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's just not something I'm good at I want you Russell Crowe to do it you'd be
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.720]   You were
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.760]   Passed on that one too
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.000]   Hey, I was thinking though the last time I was on the show. I I thought it was really successful
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.800]   Yeah, no you were great on the show man. We loved it was
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.440]   Although you know you did kind of run off at the end like guy you know had monkey pops
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:02.200]   You want to come back on the show that's fine
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:08.320]   That's you know maybe we could make it sort of a regular thing like you mean that the news a
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:16.800]   Co-anchor kind of a situation it's it's a great idea. I gotta tell you it's a it's a great idea
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.080]   it's the only thing is I'm on my jet right now and
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.880]   they
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.040]   I'm worried the phone will they have to turn it off or it will throw off the navigation system
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.520]   The boom boom and you didn't hear this from me
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:42.280]   It's a pretty strange coincidence that his transition date is right in the middle of the 2008 presidential campaign
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:48.240]   I know you're super busy, but I I'm sure you're starting to think about who would be your best running mate
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   No, I know I haven't actually declared a running mate yet bill, but I'm not sure politics is really for you
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.360]   Hey, it's bill
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.960]   Bill Shatner of Star Trek now the other bill bill Clinton oh
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.600]   Hey bill
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.640]   No, it's not an inconvenient time
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.120]   Yeah, I get it. Yeah, that was a good one
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.720]   Trust of course we'll miss him in the daily brainstorming meetings
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.540]   He's always been an innovator really inspiring all of us to think creatively about the future
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.160]   And we'll be the first to give credit where credit is due oh
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.920]   Absolutely Microsoft Bob his idea all his
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:44.960]   Like I said we've been planning for this
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.200]   But he's still bill and we'll miss seeing him in the hallway every day
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   Hey, buddy. See you tomorrow at the board meeting
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:25.320]   and all tech markets remain steady as Bill Gates completed his historic last full day as
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.840]   Microsoft
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   Personal note all of us here at NBC News will miss reporting every night on this brilliant powerful
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.280]   Let's face it sexy and good-looking leader of men and women
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.720]   It just doesn't believe in paying more than seven dollars for a haircut. I'm Brian Williams in New York
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.240]   Good night
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:57.520]   You probably know Bill Gates as the founder of Microsoft the hard-driving tech executive whose software fueled the personal computer
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.200]   Revolution you might also know him as the longtime richest man in the world
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.720]   Who left Microsoft five years ago so he could work full-time giving his money away
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.360]   We had the chance to witness Bill Gates 2.0 the man you don't know
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.880]   He is driven as much as anyone we have ever met to make the world a better place
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.840]   Gates told us why he thinks inventions are the key to success and just what he intends to accomplish with his time
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.080]   intellect and
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   67 billion dollar fortune
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.780]   Starting with its plans to knock out some of the world's deadliest diseases
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.160]   The story will continue in a moment
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:48.600]   You're gonna spend the next 20 years of your life trying to eradicate disease, yes. Yep. That's your mission
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.820]   That'll be the the majority of my time starting with polio get it done by 2018 tuberculosis
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:02.560]   That one will have to see how the tools go. The current tools are not good enough. We can to do an eradication
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.840]   They're good enough to reduce the the deaths very
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.880]   dramatically
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.120]   But we'll we'll we need a few better tools that'll take probably six or seven years malaria
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.320]   Malaria is the one that the tools are being invented now 15 and perhaps even 20 years but
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.040]   Start to really shrink that map
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.240]   These are the people Gates wants to help
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.960]   They are what he calls the bottom two billion a third of the world's population that struggles on less than two dollars a day
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.080]   They are poor
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.760]   Hungry black electricity and clean water
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:47.280]   Gates most urgent goal help the millions of children under five who die every year one every 20 seconds from
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.000]   preventable diseases
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.640]   No one alive that I know of has said my goal is to eradicate a disease and then another disease and then another disease
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.960]   This is somebody that dreams high
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.120]   Yeah, because I'm excited about that and and it's it's doable
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.960]   Today Gates spent most of his time here at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:18.120]   He runs it with his father Bill senior and his wife Melinda whom he credits with being a driving force behind the foundation
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.360]   There are over 1100 employees to help them decide which programs to fund
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:30.520]   But Gates still visit sites around the world to see what's working and what's not
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.840]   The government of Ghana and all school-age children are grateful for your support
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.180]   Very well done great to be here. The grant here go towards school nutrition. This is spinach
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.840]   Improving agriculture. We don't have enough water in the river
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.160]   And most important to Gates
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.120]   lifesaving vaccines
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.760]   Well, whenever you see a mother bringing a sick child into a facility
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.480]   It's easy to relate to what if that was my child you realize how crazy it is
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.600]   That with the world being rich enough to afford all sorts of frivolous things that those basic things still aren't aren't being provided
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.560]   But providing vaccines throughout the developing world is no simple task
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.480]   So Gates has set up his foundation to run like Microsoft
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.900]   He insists on strict accounting and when a problem arises he pulls in the best people to find solutions
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.600]   We saw a good example of that when it comes to vaccines to be effective. They need to be kept cold
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.240]   So this is using electricity, but that's tough in hard to reach areas where refrigerators are rare and unreliable
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:54.200]   So back in Seattle Gates turned to scientists at a company called intellectual ventures where he is both an investor and an inventor
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.840]   They created a superthermos using the same technology that protects spacecraft from extreme heat
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.520]   Using only a single batch of ice it can keep vaccines cold for 50 days
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.440]   So here is the thermos. That's right
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:17.880]   This holds vaccines for over 200 children and it doesn't require any battery any energy
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.520]   Its walls have been designed to be such a good thermos that even in very very hot days
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.440]   Inside it will stay cold enough to make the vaccines work
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.080]   And then when you want to take them out you just go in here and there there's a whole tray of the vaccines
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.880]   You take them out it records everything you've done with it the temperature
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.320]   So it's a replacement for all those refrigerators that have been so unreliable
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.480]   I mean just look at this thing when we take it out in the field people go. That's amazing
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.640]   You can't do that
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.760]   No matter how perfect the vaccine if you can't get it to the people who need it. It ain't doing no good
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.240]   That's right. And now you know, we need to get it to every child in the world
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.320]   Gates is betting technology will solve other age-old problems like sanitation
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   Two and a half billion people around the world do not have adequate toilets
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   That means streams and rivers get clogged with debris and human waste
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   Becoming breeding grounds for disease the toilet is one of those things
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.400]   That's like a vaccine where it really would change the situation
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:31.480]   So Gates launched a global competition design a toilet that works without plumbing
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:39.000]   We had over 20 entrants. We gave four top prizes. Some of them used burning some of them used a laser approach
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.520]   There there were quite a few novel ideas of how you reinvent the toilet
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.560]   And so this was one of the prototype designs of what a good-looking new toilet would look like it actually
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.800]   Processes everything down in here and then recycles water over the next four or five years
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.720]   We think we can have a toilet that's every bit as good as the flush toilet
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.880]   You can learn a lot about what motivates Bill Gates by visiting his private office
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.240]   He showed us why he draws inspiration from the Italian genius Leonardo da Vinci in
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.960]   1994 Gates bought da Vinci's 500 year old notebook
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.600]   He had an understanding of science that was more advanced than anybody of the time
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:28.440]   The notebook we have here is one where he's thinking about water and he's looking at how it flows when it hits barriers and goes
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.320]   Around comes back together. He's actually trying to understand turbulence
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.680]   You know, how should you build a dam how you know does it erode away?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:42.960]   It cost 30 million dollars at auction making it the most valuable manuscript in the world
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.720]   For Gates it is priceless
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:53.920]   It's an inspiration that one person off on their own with no positive feedback. Nobody ever told him, you know, what was right or wrong
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.680]   That he kept pushing himself, you know found knowledge in itself to be a beautiful thing
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.320]   Gates scoffs at any comparison to the great Leonardo
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:09.800]   But a look around his private office reveals a man equally obsessed with understanding his world
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.600]   Can I look at these sure? This is the weather one meteorology
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.360]   My very first course that I watch is this geology course
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.600]   This is a whole series on the joy of science mathematics philosophy in the real world
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:29.480]   Gates collection of DVDs contains hundreds of hours of college lectures that this famous Harvard dropout has watched
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.600]   The more you learn the more you have a framework
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.440]   That the knowledge fits into when he's on the road Gates who's a speed reader
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.000]   Lugs around what he calls his reading bag when he finishes a book. He posts his thoughts on his website
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.760]   Gates notes what I'll do is I'm reading these books. I'll take notes. Well, these are your notes already
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920]   Right. Yes. No, I love to take
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:02.040]   So I just haven't written it up yet how long will it take to read all of this Oh long time
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.880]   Thank goodness for vacations. I read a lot
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:13.640]   But Gates isn't just reading books for pleasure. He is determined to use his knowledge to back groundbreaking innovations
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:21.440]   Take this high-tech zapper. It is a laser designed to shoot down malaria infected mosquitoes in mid-flight
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.920]   And Gates showed us one of his boldest and he says most important ventures a new kind of nuclear reactor
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.120]   It would burn depleted uranium
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:38.400]   Making it cleaner safer and cheaper than today's reactors and your fuel lasts for 60 years
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.080]   And so during that entire time you don't need to open it up refuel it. You don't need to buy more fuel
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:49.400]   So there's a certain simplicity that comes with this design and when could it come on stream best case?
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Would be to have a prototype
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.640]   around 2022
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.640]   Bill Gates calls himself an
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.400]   impatient optimist a
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.340]   Description his wife Melinda says was accurate even when they met over 20 years ago Melinda. What did you like about him?
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:12.640]   Just his curiosity and his optimism about life and this belief that you know that you can change things
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.760]   I mean he believed that clearly in Microsoft. He was changing the world with software and he knew it
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:23.160]   It's the curiosity shared curiosity or their different curiosities. Well, we both have curiosity for lots of things
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.840]   Bill at this stage in our life also gets more time to read than I do quite honestly with three kids in the house
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.560]   But the great thing is Bill will go read an entire book about fertilizer and I can tell you
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Three kids in the house. I'm not gonna read a book about fertilizer, but he loves to teach and so as long as I have time
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.000]   We'll spend time. What is it about a book about fertilizer? I mean seriously fertilizers are very interesting
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.960]   We we couldn't feed a few people people would have to die if we hadn't come up with fertilizer
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.560]   How do you find a balance in all this father?
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.260]   Chairman of a major company a foundation and then all these other ventures has the balance come to you. I don't mow the lawn
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:13.040]   He's come a long way from that teenage prodigy obsessed with writing computer code over nearly four decades
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   We've watched Bill Gates helped lead the digital revolution with what he now admits was a fanatic and relentless
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:25.160]   Determination you guys never understood you never understood the first thing about this
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.600]   I'm not using this thing in the early years. There was a demanding guy. There was a driven guy. There was obsessed guy
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.280]   There was some say an arrogant guy. Have you changed?
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.760]   I'm certainly learned
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:48.640]   When I make a mistake, you know and my thinking is sloppy I like to be very hard on myself like that is so stupid
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.800]   How could you not see how those pieces fit together and that way that you're you know?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.600]   Very disciplined yourself and careful about your thinking you don't want it to extend
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.080]   To when other people may not get something quite as quickly
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   It's like oh, you know, how come you don't don't get this thing as he mellowed at all
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.320]   I hope any of us in life mature, right?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.040]   We all mature but look I wouldn't have married Bill if there wasn't a huge heart with all the adjectives
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:22.560]   You just used about how he drove his career, which was very successful for Microsoft. There was an enormous heart always there
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.600]   No question Gates has softened with age
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   Just listen to how he reflected on his often tumultuous relationship with the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.040]   He and I in a sense grew up together. We were within a year of the same age and you know
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.800]   We were kind of naively optimistic and built big companies
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:51.080]   We achieved all of it and most of it as rivals, but we always retained a certain respect communication
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:58.320]   Including even when he was sick. I got to go down and spend time with them and talked about what know about
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.920]   what we'd learned about
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   Families anything
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:10.880]   Today gate says he gets advice on patience and generosity from his friend Warren Buffett who seven years ago
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.320]   entrusted the majority of his fortune to the Gates Foundation and
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:23.400]   From his father Bill senior a lawyer who prodded his son into giving his money away. You've said before this is your hero
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   Why?
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   Well, my dad has
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   integrity
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.920]   He's got a humble approach to things. He's calm
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.800]   And wise about things
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   It's just a huge influence to always, you know want to live up to a great example
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:49.000]   Someone said to me your son may be the most influential person in the 21st century. I can only say yes
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   he's determined as
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He already has proven that he can dramatically reduce the number of kids under five who died
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.840]   You can't do any better than that. That's right. That's right is
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.200]   There's no way to be unimpressed about that
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:12.040]   You couldn't be more proud. I couldn't be more proud. That is exactly true
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:21.200]   Go to 60 minutes overtime calm to hear more about the great rivalry and friendship between
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   You
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:43.240]   You're working at two companies simultaneously which is kind of extraordinary in itself and you have this amazing way of
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.320]   You spent just talk really quickly about how you balance those two. I think it's kind of interesting. Yeah, so I
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.440]   the only way to do this is to be very disciplined and very practiced and
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.800]   And the way I found that works for me is I theme my days
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:06.560]   So on Monday Monday at both companies focus on management and running the company, which is you know
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.440]   We have our directional meeting at square and we have our op-com meeting at Twitter
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.080]   I do all my management one-on-ones on that day
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.000]   Tuesday is focused on product Wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   Thursday is focused on
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.660]   developers and partnerships and Friday is
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:32.280]   Is focused on the company in the culture and recruiting Saturday? I take off I hike and then Sunday is
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.080]   reflection feedback strategy getting ready for the the rest of the week and
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.440]   there's interruptions all the time, but I
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.400]   Can quickly deal with an interruption and then know that it's Tuesday
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.520]   I have product meetings and I need to focus on product stuff and it also sets a good cadence for the rest of the company
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.960]   So that we're always delivering. We're always showing, you know where we were last week and where we're going to be
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.640]   The following week so it's been good
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.760]   But we're always we're always evolving and you're splitting your time equally between the two. Yep. How many hours at each one?
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.120]   eight hours at each one and I live across
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   eight hours
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:27.560]   Another thing I wanted to ask you about was your work day. I mean, I know you're famous for the four-hour work week
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:35.360]   But you've also explained, you know that beyond just doing the basic things you you go beyond those four hours
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:42.280]   Do you love doing that you're passionate about and that yeah, that's inspiring and I'd like to hear about your
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:49.240]   Typical work day your routine. I know it changes probably, you know day-to-day, but just something that you typically do
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.120]   Sure, so I'll give you the framework
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.840]   I think that that routine can be very empowering as a as a positive constraint and I think
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.400]   Having things scheduled also helps you to get more done
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.280]   So you've probably heard the expression if you want to get something done give it to a busy man
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.100]   I think that's very true and that comes back to Parkinson's Law
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.980]   So I'll give you my framework for the day and then what fills certain spaces varies day to day
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.160]   But generally I wake up around 10 a.m
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.240]   Which is very late for most people but I go to bed around 2 or 3
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.200]   And I do make sure that I get my sleep
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:30.640]   Almost always 8 to 9 hours unless it's prior to some type of event or presentation in which case
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   I generally don't sleep
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.240]   Then I'll get up have a quick breakfast
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:44.160]   Do about 10 to 15 minutes of reading generally things like Seneca something to really put my mind in the right frame
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.840]   for the rest of the day and
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.760]   Then I'll do a
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.760]   Workout, so I'll do a workout generally
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.960]   Resistance training for 20 to 30 minutes and then from that point for about a two-hour period
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.040]   I'll work on any one of my projects that could be helping
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.280]   Startups that I've invested in I do work as an angel investor here in Silicon Valley
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.480]   It could be any number of different things this week
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.520]   I'm actually selling a company that I'm involved with and that's taking up most of my time
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.520]   Then I'll have lunch around 1 or 2 p.m
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.400]   and that's usually
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.280]   Along with a trip to pick up mail or packages if I have any after that point I will
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.840]   In the last few months do a
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.600]   Swimming workout of about 45 minutes then do another let's say 4 to 5 hours on particular projects
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.320]   I'll take us to 6 or 7. I have a small snack workout again
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.240]   and then
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   Two or two or three, but they're very short some of these workouts might only be 10 15 minutes keep in mind especially in the morning
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.880]   It's the greatest mental performance enhancer
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   Possible physical exercise really not separating the the brain and other organs
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.760]   and then I will have after working out I'll have a nice big meal and
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:21.480]   Come home and from about I would say 8 p.m. To 11 p.m. Is generally allocated to spending time with friends
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:28.840]   And I'll oftentimes have lunch with friends business associates. They're they're usually one in the same now
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.560]   And then my most productive writing period and I enjoy writing
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:41.000]   As difficult as it is for me my best writing period is from about I would say midnight or 1 a.m. To
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.840]   3 4 a.m. And so I'll generally sit down with a glass of wine or two and
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:56.080]   Some tea and write and I'll put on a headset and usually play music off of Pandora and I'll have a music in the I'm
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.840]   Sorry a movie in the background playing on big screen TV
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.400]   So that it feels like I'm in a social environment, even though the TV is actually muted
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.000]   That is my routine
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.680]   Well, that's part of the reason I found that I get my best work done between 1 and 3 or 4 a.m
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.440]   Is that particularly since I'm on the West Coast the options for?
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.040]   procrastination and distraction are fewer and
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.400]   Whenever possible in my life, I try to control my environment
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.040]   Rather than control my behavior. So I think that's
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.640]   Changing your environment and designing your environment and that includes schedule is oftentimes much more effective than trying to rely on
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:57.040]   Self-discipline for certain things and I've really tried to follow that as much as possible making it impossible for me to misbehave in other words
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Welcome
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:21.080]   Welcome welcome welcome. Welcome to episode 12 of the radical personal finance podcast today is July 2
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.660]   2014 and our topic of the day retirement
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.340]   Today we're gonna expose the elephant in the living room is
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:38.620]   Retirement a complete and utter scam or is it something that we should be working towards at all? Stay with us
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.540]   So welcome welcome welcome again, my name is Joshua sheets
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:00.260]   I'm your host for today's episode of the radical personal finance podcast and after that length the
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:06.940]   Introduction. I hope that you have some sense of where we are going with today's show
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.900]   I'm sure that if you
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.340]   picked up on it the theme through all of it is retirement and
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.020]   so
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:22.700]   One of the things that I've learned working with financial planning is that retirement is almost the universal goal in the universal
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:30.060]   Universal discussion. So today we are going to try to break down some of the myths of retirement and we're going to try to
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:38.180]   Expose some alternate ideas and some alternate things that can be done to advance retirement. I
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.980]   Find the return I find the retirement
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:51.060]   Discussion a lot of times extremely frustrating and the thing that I've learned over time is that nobody retires
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:56.820]   Nobody retires. I first learned this I'll share a little bit of personal history
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.780]   I first learned this watching my two grandfathers and I had one grandfather
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.380]   Who was a farmer and another grandfather who was a teacher?
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.260]   he was actually a
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.860]   Farmer and a rancher earlier in his life and then he went back to school and became a teacher and ultimately
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.220]   Wound up spending most of his career working as a college professor
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:21.460]   But in working with and watching these grandparents, one of the things that I learned is that neither of them quit
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:27.140]   My grandfather who was a teacher he actually quote-unquote retired about three times
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.700]   I think he left three different retirement parties at different points of his age, but at his final job
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.020]   He was working as a tutor at a local community college tutoring students on
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.820]   on
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.740]   Math and
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.140]   The only reason he ever quit at about the age of his mid 80s
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.740]   I think it was 84 83 84 something like that
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.760]   But the only reason that he ever quit is because it became unsafe for him to drive, but he loved it every single day
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.340]   Every single day of his life prior to that time
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.540]   He would get in his car get up early 5 5 30 in the morning get up early go down spend his day
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.840]   Tutoring his students and he loved it. My other grandfather was a farmer and if any of you know farmers
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.060]   Then you know that a farmer never retires
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:14.220]   He just kind of pulls back a little bit and so I on the other hand was always interested in early retirement
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.860]   I was always interested in quitting work early
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.380]   And so when I became a financial advisor about six years ago
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:25.540]   One of the things that I decided to work at was to focus a lot on retirement planning
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.500]   but I learned that
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:37.180]   Nobody retires and I make I'm gonna make some broad generalizations in today's world and I'm gonna bake
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.780]   Excuse me in today's show. I'm gonna make some broad generalizations, and I understand when I'm making
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.860]   Statements for dramatic effect, so I'm aware of them, but I think they do need to be said
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.780]   But one of the things that I learned is that nobody retires in today's world
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.420]   the people that have the money to retire are the ones that never quit and
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:36:00.340]   the people that desperately want to retire the most are the ones who never accumulate the money to quit and
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.380]   So in in essence you find out that nobody is retiring
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:11.620]   so I just played that audio montage and I'll tell you who they were as far as who all of the all of the
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.700]   Videos were that I played for you there
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.620]   But the first video that you had was an introduction the first video was an introduction
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.860]   From on Warren Buffett and here's Warren Buffett at however old he is now
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.080]   He's never retired. He wrote a there's a book written about him called tap dancing to work
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.780]   That's his by and the person that was being interviewed with him was Carol Loomis who's his longtime
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.820]   Person who editor who helps him with his writing and so Warren says I'll never retire and the day
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.840]   I'll retire is the day. I'm gonna go is the day. I'm gonna die
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.300]   Billionaire Steve Jobs billionaire never retired till the day that he died
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.140]   Bill Gates billionaire that video that I played was from his see
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.060]   CES
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.980]   Presentation right before he quote-unquote retired and then the video following shows that clearly it's obvious that he's never retired although
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.540]   He's no longer working at Microsoft. He moved on and he's spending more time working
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.060]   He's spending more time working
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:13.020]   Than probably he did before and maybe there's a little bit more of a balance in his life
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.060]   There sure could be but he's certainly not retired. The next video was Jack Dorsey who is the billionaire?
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.100]   co-founder of Twitter and and the CEO of Square
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.420]   The next video after that is Tim Ferriss
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.660]   So Tim Ferriss writes a book called the four-hour workweek excellent book highly recommended enjoyed it immensely
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.580]   But he writes a book called the four-hour workweek and it's clear from his daily schedule
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:38.540]   He's probably working on average 12 to 14 hours a day now to his credit
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.420]   He's very clear about that in any interview and he's very clear that you know
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.200]   The four-hour workweek is kind of a gimmicky title designed to sell books and that he doesn't praise
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.900]   inactivity his goal is to get people to
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:55.920]   His goal is to to get people to be to stop the time-wasting parts of activity
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.960]   But just pointing out this this issue of that nobody retires
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:07.260]   so this one this has really bothered me over the years and I do not have I don't have the answers but
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.540]   As I observe something I just I believe we need to have a new conversation
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.820]   In this country and where it's gonna start is with retirement in today's world in the finance world
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:24.100]   You have a lot of people that are very focused on early retirement. I think that's awesome to me. That's a really valuable
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:30.820]   Thing to pursue as well, but even the people that are early retirees. They don't retire
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.620]   The
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:40.200]   Probably the two most prominent financial bloggers that I'm aware of one is is is Jacob Lund Fisker who writes the blog
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.580]   Early retirement extreme I've reviewed his book and I hope he'll come on this show for an interview at some point
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.620]   But Jacob Fisker
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:53.540]   He's written on his in his writings that he actually regrets using the word retire because he's not retired
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:59.300]   Even now he's no longer blogging. He's working to the best of my knowledge in the investment trading business
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.440]   Earning money. I don't have any idea doesn't really matter
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.940]   Mr. Money mustache at mr. Money mustache comm blog about early retirement. See retired. Absolutely not
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.900]   he's working harder than ever, but he's working on projects that he enjoys and
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:21.660]   He's probably making more money than ever. He's probably just simply enjoying his life more. So whether we
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:27.060]   By the way, he wrote an article called the internet retirement police, which is quite fun
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.700]   I don't think I qualify as part of the internet retirement police, but it's one of the common
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:38.380]   Allegations against people saying, you know, you're not actually retired. I just think the word retired. We needed an expanding
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.660]   understanding of that word
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:46.660]   The idea that you're gonna reach a point in time at which you just completely quit and never and never
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.020]   work again is a very
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   new and interesting idea
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:58.340]   so it's the origin of the retirement has always really always bothered me and
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.900]   I'm gonna do my I don't first of all to be clear. I don't have all the answers
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.540]   In fact, I am looking for answers on this subject and I've done a good bit of research
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:14.180]   But I've done a good bit of research, but I still don't have I still don't have
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.640]   A full understanding of it. And so for the next couple of shows we're gonna be talking about retirement
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:25.020]   But not from the technical how do you save money and what should you do to save for retirement that comes later?
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.620]   But right now we're just gonna be talking about retirement as a concept and I would invite your comments and invite your feedbacks
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.100]   I'm gonna be doing a lot of
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.840]   Reading of some articles and I'm gonna be doing some extensive reading from a book which I'll introduce in a little bit
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.500]   as well that has helped me and basically the idea behind today's show is simply to
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.780]   Give some background for you
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.260]   As far as some ideas and some commentary that may help you to understand more of what you want to do
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.580]   I'm gonna add one more article before we go into
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.740]   Kind of the history of retirement. I'm gonna read an article from the Washington Post
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.200]   And this article was bylined of June 10
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:11.180]   Of the art in the Washington Post and the title is called Bill Marriott Warren Buffett Rupert Murdoch Murdoch and the age of the everlasting
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.940]   executive
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   The writer here is Michael Rosenwald
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.580]   He's 82 now
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:22.180]   But Bill Marriott can't bring himself to completely walk away from the company that bears his name on Tuesday
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.080]   the octogenarian presided over the grand opening of the gleaming
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:34.460]   1175 room Marriott Marquis the new Convention Center Hotel in Northwest, Washington that his family considers one of its proudest legacies. I
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.260]   Really do wish my parents could be here to see this wonderful and monumental
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:46.260]   Hotel Marriott told about 200 guests who toasted the hotel with root beer to honor the nine stool district root beer stand that begat a
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.820]   hotel empire
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.440]   Though Marriott no longer runs the company. He transformed into a global lodging chain
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:42:00.540]   He remains its executive chairman still working 50 hours a week and visiting more than 200 hotels a year in the process
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.020]   He has become one of the country's most prominent everlasting executives a small but high-profile
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:14.220]   group of golden aged Titans whose identities and personal fortunes are so wrapped up in their firms that the concept of retirement is
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.300]   incomprehensible
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   Many of them bear famous names
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.160]   News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch age 83 Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:31.620]   91 Berkshire Hathaway investment legend Warren Buffett 83 and Marriott who ran his company for 39 years
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.980]   But there are less prominent ones to Melvin Gordon chief executive of Tootsie Roll Industries is 94
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:44.460]   Oh Bruton Smith, the chief of Sonic Automotive a fortune 500 group of auto dealerships is 87
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:50.460]   Owning large stakes gives these executives the ability to essentially hang around as long as they please
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:57.780]   But academics who study and interview older executives say there is a complicated psychology at play and that advances in health care
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.840]   Marriott has survived several heart attacks mean the country could see more everlasting executives in the future
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.900]   What motivates them for starters death?
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:14.440]   One way of pushing death away as hard work said Manfred FR Ketz DeVry who studies management
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.880]   psychology and is the author of a paper titled death and the executives and
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.020]   Executive encounters with the stealth motivator
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:27.360]   Work as a way of not thinking about it as opposed to sitting on the golf course and having some drinks
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.800]   It's about finding and having meaning though
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.400]   There are studies showing that the older executives get the more risk averse they become
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:41.000]   Potentially robbing shareholders of big acquisitions that could improve companies bottom line that that drawback
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.200]   some experts say is ignored by corporate boards too worried about pushing out popular figures whose identities would vanish without their jobs a
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:56.920]   report by the conference board a business research group showed that mandatory retirement policies are now seldom used and the
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.920]   Idea of everlasting work is filtering down to the lower executive ranks with surveys by Gallup and others
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.040]   Showing that large numbers of baby boomers intend to put off retirement because they find work
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.760]   Rewarding or because their retirement accounts took a beating in the recession
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:19.120]   Some 10% of organizations now offer some form of phased retirement according to the Society for Human Resource Management
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.880]   If you have reasonably good health and a real interest in what you're doing
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:31.080]   There is no reason why you can't continue contributing for as long as you can said Fred Malek a close friend of Marriott and former
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:37.040]   President at the company. He's still working at age 77 people like Bill are lucky to have that
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.400]   Marriott's everlasting career is somewhat rare when compared to Murdoch
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.720]   Redstone and Buffett all of whom still wield considerable day-to-day control over their companies
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.920]   Marriott stepping away was the subject of intense speculation over the years
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:57.880]   Especially after his son John left the company in 2005 leaving no other family member ready in age or experience
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.200]   to fill the top job
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:05.880]   Marriott turned to Arnie Sorenson a young well-liked executive he had personally groomed
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.240]   Sorenson said he regularly consults with Marriott whose office is just down the hall at the company's Bethesda, Maryland headquarters
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.880]   Not because he has to but because he wants to
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:22.820]   Marriott he added remains deeply interested in hotel operations and isn't shy about bringing up ideas or problems
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.560]   He attends monthly senior staff meetings in
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.440]   Marriott Sorenson has a counselor with such love and recall for details that in an interview
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.120]   He offered the secret to a famous hot shops dessert
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.840]   The key to our hot fudge ice cream cake was to leave a spot in the middle of the cake on the top and not cover
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.580]   It with anything so you could put your whipped cream and cherry on a dry spot
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.160]   If you put it on top of the chocolate, it would slide off and you wouldn't have good ice cream cake
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.640]   by hanging around
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.160]   Marriott is hedging a bit and making sure his successor lands on his feet said Donald C
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.860]   Hambrick a management professor at Penn State University who has studied lengthy executive tenures
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.200]   He is showing that he's pooling for Sorenson and doesn't want to leave him high and dry
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:11.600]   Asked what he thinks Marriott gets out of his role Sorenson said it keeps him young and active and engaged
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.400]   He's a big competitor. He wants to win
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.040]   His family thinks they win, too
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:24.080]   My dad will never stop working said daughter Deborah Marriott Harrison and we're happy about that because he would probably curl up in the fetal
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.860]   Position and die because this company has been so much a part of his life
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.280]   But he's no longer putting in 80 hours a week. They get more of him at home
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.680]   He's less preoccupied and more in the moment Harrison said earlier this year
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:42.080]   Harrison saw him play a game with one of his 15 grandchildren a fishing expedition with magnets
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:49.200]   He and his granddaughter played for 45 minutes who won. Are you kidding? Marriott said laughing she won
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:56.000]   So contrast that article with this article right here, this is from USA Today
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.120]   of
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.800]   from a USA Today article on personal finance
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.160]   published April 1
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.640]   2014 and the writer here is Nancy Helmick. And so this is the article that pervades
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.720]   Just about everywhere you look in the financial world
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.240]   Retirement a third have less than $1,000 put away
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.160]   Most people aren't trying to figure out how much they'll need in their golden years
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   Most people have very little tucked away for retirement and many aren't even trying to figure out how much they'll need later in life a
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.640]   new national survey reveals
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:38.360]   About 36% of workers have less than $1,000 in savings and investments that could be used for retirement
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:43.440]   not counting their primary residence or defined benefit plans such as traditional pensions and
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.160]   60% of workers have less than
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.560]   $25,000 according to a telephone survey of
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.880]   1,000 workers and
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:57.360]   501 retirees from the non-profit employee benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:05.280]   Only 44% say they or their spouses have tried to calculate how much money they'll need to save by the time they retire
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.920]   So that they can live comfortably in their golden years the survey shows
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:15.840]   Workers who have done calculations and what they need to save tend to have higher levels of savings than those who haven't crunched the numbers
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.240]   interesting little did
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.000]   Excuse me a little interesting little tidbit there in that sentence
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:29.100]   There's an incredible difference between those lucky enough to have a retirement plan and those who don't says Jack Vander High. I'm gonna pause
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:34.540]   this drives me nuts anybody can have a retirement plan and I
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.260]   Won't preach on it right now
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.940]   Nobody is lucky to have a retirement plan people who want a retirement plan can get one
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.620]   There is nobody that's excluded from retirement plans in this country period
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:50.980]   There's an incredible difference between those lucky enough to have a retirement plan and those who don't says Jack Vander High
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.720]   The Institute's research director and co-author of the 2014 retirement confidence survey
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.500]   What's really striking is that 73% of those without a retirement plan?
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:06.040]   My comment because of their choice such as an IRA 401k or 403 B have less than
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:13.300]   $1,000 in savings and investments the reason defined benefits weren't included in the total is most people don't know how much those are worth
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.820]   He says that's been hugely true in my own benefit
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.340]   If you have a defined benefit plan understand how much it's worth almost nobody that I've ever talked to
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.020]   Actually understands how much their defined benefit plans are worth
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:30.860]   Continuing on many people realize that they are not on track and saving for retirement and the two most important reasons
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.220]   They give for not saving more our cost of living and day-to-day expenses Vander High says
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:40.660]   People's confidence that they'll have a comfortable retirement has risen slightly after record lows in the last five years
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.060]   with 18% of workers in
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:49.140]   2014 saying that they are very confident they can retire comfortably up from 13% who are very confident in
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.580]   2013 meanwhile
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:57.020]   24% are not at all confident. They have enough saved for a comfortable retirement about the same as
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.820]   2013
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:04.740]   Retirement confidence is moat is present mostly in people with higher incomes and in those with retirement plans Vander High says
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:12.220]   The survey quote highlights the impending retirement crisis that we will face over the next 20 years says Mark fried
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.820]   president of TFG wealth management in Newton, Pennsylvania
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:21.100]   When I see those these numbers I have a I have a I have to ask the question. How did we get here?
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.500]   We need more financial education in the schools in the media in the workplace
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:30.300]   If possible people 40 and older should try to save up to 20% of their income
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.020]   He says quote if you can't afford to do that right now
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   Then set this as a target and as you get annual raises put aside part of each raise until you reach the 20% number
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.700]   Fried says invest in your company's retirement account up to the match
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:47.940]   One of the best ways to increase your retirement savings is to take advantage of your employer match if you have one
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.900]   He says John Pearshale a certified financial planner at Pearshale financial group of Crystal Lake
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:59.540]   Illinois says try to imagine how much you're going to need to have saved up to last you to 20 to 30 years during
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:05.460]   Retirement the only way you can figure that out is to do some retirement calculations. We help clients figure this out
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.700]   If people are way behind in saving for retirement
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.940]   They may need to work longer at their current job or get a second job to help fill the savings gap
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:18.180]   Pearshale says quote if you had the idea that you were going to retire at 62 or 65
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.780]   And you don't have enough saved up then you have to keep working
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.620]   other survey findings
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:30.560]   Debt is weighing heavily on many people with 58 percent of workers and 44 percent of retirees saying they have a problem with their level
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.620]   of debt
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:37.100]   Like workers. Did you notice 44 percent of retirees saying they have a problem with their level of debt?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:43.020]   Like like workers many retirees are also short on funds with 58 percent of them having less than
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:48.860]   $25,000 in savings and investments not counting their primary residence or defined benefits plans
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.440]   Which are traditional pensions and 29 percent having less than $1,000
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.660]   note that
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.740]   29 percent of retirees have less than $1,000
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:06.020]   Although 65 percent of workers plan to work for pay in retirement only 27 percent of retirees say they are working for pay
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.100]   during their golden years
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.720]   That point is incredibly important, and we're going to talk about that in detail
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:20.340]   Total savings and investments reported by workers not including the value of primary residence or defined benefit plans such as a traditional benefit
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.000]   30 for 6 percent have less than a thousand bucks
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.820]   16 percent have between a thousand bucks and ten grand eight percent have ten to twenty five thousand
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:35.620]   Twenty five to fifty nine percent fifty to not ten to a hundred nine percent and a hundred to two fifty eleven percent
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   250 or more 11%
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:45.580]   Total savings and investments reported by retirees not including the value of the primary residence
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:49.020]   less than a thousand bucks 29%
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.900]   So
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.260]   This is a decent article. I mean, I don't have any problem with the article just
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.400]   the problem is is that it's it's an it's a
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:11.620]   Find myself speechless which is unusual the problem with the article is that there's no
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:17.060]   It's like what do you do? Okay, and what I compare this to is I compare this to
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:22.840]   Kind of like the low-fat thing in this country if you pay any attention over the last
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:30.140]   30 years how long has you know eat low calories whole grains and low-fat been working and go and look at the statistics and you'll
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.900]   See that over that entire time Americans have gotten fatter and fatter and fatter and less and less and less healthy
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:39.020]   So at what point in time do you wake up and say the Emperor is not wearing any clothes?
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:43.460]   You know the elephants in the living room. There's you know, this isn't working and
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:51.160]   To me that's what I feel like the whole retirement situation in in this country is it's not working clearly if you say that you have
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:57.300]   this woeful kind of ringing of the hands article which again this one's pretty balanced and less than
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.380]   36% of workers have less than a thousand dollars and
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.100]   11% of workers have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:11.580]   Which two hundred fifty thousand dollars or more is just scratching the surface of what you would need to have saved for retirement if you were
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.580]   planning on living off of investment assets
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.520]   You've got a problem. It doesn't work. It's clearly not working period now. What's the solution?
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.640]   There's tons of solutions and that's what we're going to talk about at length throughout this show
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:31.560]   But again 29% of workers have less than a thousand dollars. So that means that either they're living purely on social security
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.220]   or that
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.260]   So this doesn't this doesn't include the value of a traditional pension defined benefit plan
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.960]   So hopefully they have some defined benefit plans, but you got 30% of retirees have less than a thousand dollars saved
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.180]   So what's going on? Well
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.820]   Clearly, you know those retirees are figuring out a way to
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.380]   To make it work and we've got to talk about new solutions
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:01.020]   We've got to talk about new solutions of ways that you know
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.860]   Other than just simply a bunch of you know
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:08.220]   Certified financial plan are saying you need to save more money and no offense to the guy that's in this article. It's true
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.060]   It's 20% would be awesome
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.300]   That would be a great recommendation for people to make
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.240]   unfortunately, these little soundbite pieces of
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:23.780]   Advice just simply don't work because you know a who's gonna change their behavior because they they just read an article on this
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:28.680]   And it doesn't give you any tools. That's why I'm creating this podcast is kind of because of this frustration
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.860]   We've got to do something better
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.780]   but I think before we do and talk about solutions which we will not get to in today's show and
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:41.380]   55 minutes and and I'm just getting warmed up, but we're not going to talk about solutions today
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.180]   That's gonna be a separate show
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:47.660]   we're gonna talk about history today, and I'm gonna read a couple more articles that are helpful and
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.260]   so
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.260]   And then we're gonna go in detail
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:56.860]   Using a book called a history of retirement that I was able to find that was written back in
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:02.380]   Back in
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.620]   1980
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.940]   By it's published by Yale
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:10.100]   Yale University and the author's name is William Grabener and
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:15.380]   To me it's been the most comprehensive thing that has helped me but to kind of set the stage
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.300]   Let's talk about the history of retirement
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:23.540]   What got me interested in this is that I've always heard this anecdote and maybe you've heard it as well
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.100]   but that retirement was originally intended as a punishment and
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:33.140]   so the story as it was told to me is that the inventor of retirement was
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:38.380]   German Chancellor Bismarck and the way that I was told the story in the way that I remembered it is that
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.980]   retirement was intended as a punishment and basically he looked around and he had a bunch of
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:49.540]   Political competitors and he was trying to figure out how to get rid of his political competitors and
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.580]   He noticed that they were all old. So he said I've got an idea
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:56.100]   let's institute mandatory retirement starting at the age of 65 and
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:01.620]   That'll get rid of my political competitors. So he sold it to them as this is a great idea
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.420]   Let's have mandatory retirement for everybody. And so everybody loved it
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.660]   We're gonna sit back and live on the dole for the rest of our life and we're in good shape
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.940]   And the state's gonna pay for our retirement
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   So at this point in time, we can you know, we can retire and that single-handedly wiped out his political competition
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.540]   That's how I heard the story and as was most things anytime anytime you check a story like that
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.900]   Probably has some amount of truth in it, but it's probably not
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.780]   the full truth, so
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.060]   I've done a lot of research on this and I want to do more
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:36.860]   But let me read you some articles and I think these articles have set a good
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:44.020]   overview and then prior to our getting into retirement in the United States of America, which is the the primary focus of
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.820]   the primary focus of this
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:48.860]   primary focus of
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.980]   This show obviously, so we're gonna cover three articles here
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:56.080]   The first one is from the New York Times and it's called the history of retirement
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.460]   This was published March 21 1999 by Mary Lou Wiseman
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.500]   the history of retirement from early man to AARP in
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.820]   The beginning in the beginning there was no retirement
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   There were no old people in the Stone Age
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:17.620]   Everyone was fully employed until age 20 by which time nearly everyone was dead usually of unnatural causes baloney
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:23.620]   But I'll keep going any early man who lived long enough to develop crows feet was either worshipped or eaten as a sign of respect
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:29.180]   even in biblical times when a fair number of people made it into old age retirement still had not been invented and
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:36.220]   Respect for old people remained high in those days. It was customary to carry on until you dropped regardless of your age group
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:42.160]   No shuffleboard, no Airstream trailer when a patriarch could no longer farm herd cattle or pitch a tent
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:49.940]   He opted for more specialized less labor-intensive work like like prophesying and handing down commandments or he moved in with his kids
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.240]   Drives me nuts
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:59:01.060]   Elder hostile elder hostile as the centuries passed the elderly population increased by early medieval times their numbers had reached critical mass
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:06.960]   It was no longer just a matter of respecting the occasional white bearded patriarch old people were everywhere giving advice
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:12.280]   Repeating themselves complaining about rheumatism trying to help getting in the way and making younger people feel guilty
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.160]   Plus they tended to hang on to their wealth and property
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:22.720]   this made them very unpopular with their middle-aged sons who were driven to earn their inheritance as the old-fashioned way by committing patricide and
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.000]   Even as late as the mid 18th century
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.740]   There was a spate of such killings in France by 1882 so patricide being the idea of killing off the the the patriarch evidently
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:40.760]   in 1882 Anthony Trollope wrote a futuristic novel the fixed period in which he foresaw retiring large numbers of old men to a place where
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:48.520]   They would be encouraged to enjoy a year of contemplation followed by a peaceful chloroforming, but this was hardly an acceptable long-term strategy
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:54.760]   Old people hanging on to their worldly goods also threatened the social and economic fabric of colonial America
[00:59:54.760 --> 01:00:01.160]   Celebrated Puritan zealot Cotton Mather is generally credited with stimulating the national appetite for witch trials
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.520]   But few people realized that he was among the first to try to force the elderly to retire
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.280]   Quote be so wise as to disappear of your own accord
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:16.240]   He exhorted them be glad of dismission be pleased with the retirement which you are dismissed into and quote
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.720]   nobody listened in
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.440]   1883 Chancellor Otto von Bismarck of Germany had a problem
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.840]   Marxists were threatening to take control of Europe to help his countrymen resist their blandishments
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.320]   Bismarck announced that he would pay a pension to any non working German over age 65
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.800]   Bismarck was no dummy hardly anyone lived to age 65 at the time
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.440]   Total baloney as well
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   Given that penicillin would not be available for another half-century
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:50.320]   Bismarck not only co-opted the Marxist but set the arbitrary world standard for the exact year at which the old age at which old age
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.520]   Begins and established the precedent that government should pay people for growing old
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.120]   It was the world-renowned physician William Osler
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.120]   We're going to discuss him in depth who laid the scientific foundations that when combined with a compelling economic
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.800]   Rationale would eventually make retirement acceptable in his 1905
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   Valedictory address at the Johns Hopkins Hospital where he had been physician-in-chief. I'll read that to you tomorrow
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.920]   Osler said it was a matter of fact that the years between 25 and 40 in a worker's career are the quote
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.520]   15 golden years of plenty and
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.720]   Quote he called that span quote the anabolic or constructive period
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.980]   Close quote workers between ages 40 and 60 were merely uncreative and therefore tolerable
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:42.120]   He hated to say it because he was getting on but after age 60 the average worker was useless and should be put out to pasture
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:50.600]   Retirement came in very handy in the United States when large were large numbers of aging factory workers were wandering around the Industrial Revolution
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.360]   Dropping things into the works slowing down assembly lines
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.720]   Taking too many personal days and usurping the places of younger more productive men with families to support
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.160]   it was one thing when an occasional an
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:10.160]   Occasional superannuated farmer leaned on his hoe in an agrarian culture a few bales of hay more or less didn't matter
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.120]   But it was quite another when lots of old people caused great unemployment among younger workers
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:23.900]   By refusing to retire the Great Depression made the situation even worse it was a Darwinian sacrificial moment
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.380]   Retirement was a necessary adaptation and everybody knew it
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.040]   But the old guys were not going quietly the toughest among them refused to quit
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.560]   Even when plant managers turned up the conveyor belts to chaplain esque speeds
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.560]   pause for a moment to the best of my ability to
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:49.760]   Research this this paragraph in in my experiences is kind of the the key
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.720]   this to me shows
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.840]   again, probably the the primary
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.600]   The primary reason and we'll talk about that in detail tomorrow
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.440]   by 1935 it became evident that the only way to get old people to stop working for pay was to pay them enough to stop
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.680]   working a
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:15.880]   Californian Francis Townsend initiated a popular movement by proposing mandatory retirement at age 60 in
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:23.240]   Exchange the government would pay pensions of up to $200 a month an amount equivalent at the time to a full salary for a middle-income
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.520]   worker
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.400]   horrified at the prospect of Townsend's radical generosity
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:35.280]   President Franklin D Roosevelt proposed the Social Security Act of 1935 which made workers pay for their own old age insurance
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.240]   What used to mean going to bed suddenly meant banishment to an empty stage of life called?
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.360]   Retirement if people were not going to work. What were they going to do sit in a rocking chair?
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:54.920]   Eleanor Roosevelt thought so quote old people love their own things even more than young people do it means so much to sit in
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.000]   The same chair you sat in for a great many years she said in 1934, but she was wrong
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.920]   Most retired people wished they could work the problem was still acute in
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:11.760]   1951 when the Corning company convened a roundtable to figure out how to make retirement more popular at so notice
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:19.240]   1951 but she was wrong most people most retired people wished they could work the problem was still acute in
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:26.560]   1951 when the Corning company convened a roundtable to figure out how to make retirement more popular at that conference
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.360]   Santa Rama Rao an author and student of Eastern and Western cultures
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.420]   Complained that Americans did not have the capacity to enjoy doing nothing
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:41.840]   The opposite of work turned out to be play the rich discovered leisure first, but by night
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.400]   But by 1910 Florida became accessible to the middle class
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:52.200]   Retirement communities were older people did not have to see younger people working began to appear in the 1920s and 30s
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.600]   the number of golf courses in the United States tripled between
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.160]   1921 and 1930
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.900]   Subsequent technological developments like movies and television helped turn having nothing to do into a leisure time activity
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.960]   From now on the elderly would work at play
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.480]   The publication in 1955 of senior citizen magazine was the first widespread use of the euphemism that
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.520]   While intending to reconfer respect instead made a senior citizen sound like an over decorated captain in the Pirates of Penzance
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:28.920]   It's it's merely partial success may also be so the introduction of the word
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:35.400]   Senior or senior citizen it's merely partial success may also be linked to the fact that there is something inherently
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.120]   Suspicious about an age group that has to offer its potential members discounts to induce them to join
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.840]   the R word in
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.120]   1999 the American Association of Retired Persons
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:54.200]   Once the welcome wagon of retirement dropped the word retirement from its name and became the American Association of our
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.720]   persons
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.600]   This change was affected in recognition of a basic reality
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:05.520]   Many of its members are not retired and in anticipation of the baby boomers threat never to stop wearing lycra turn gray
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:13.720]   And in anticipation of the baby boomers threat never to stop wearing lycra to turn gray to stop carrying around bottled water or retire
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:20.120]   Although the article is clearly a bit sarcastic which good for her
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:26.200]   to me, that's a good overview of a good overview of
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   a
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:37.360]   Good overview of kind of the situation and she and the author there Mary Lou Weissman writes a couple of a couple of important details
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:44.320]   Especially about the development of retirement in America, but the key couple of key points. I want to point out from that in
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.720]   1951
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.960]   people still did not want to retire and I feel like this is probably underrepresented in today's world and
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.280]   You know, I was born in the mid 80s and I grew up in a world thinking
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.120]   Well, everyone needs to retire and all I stuffed into my head was retirement books about how to retire with retirement
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.560]   Kind of being painted as this golden prospect
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.800]   I'm not so sure it is and there are lots of strategies of how to deal with it
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.240]   But there are a lot of changes that are happening
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.520]   Incidentally a quick side trip. I kind of mocked this idea that
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.240]   That the average person hardly anyone lived to be age 65 in 1883
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.880]   I'll give credit for this is that I've listened
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.800]   I listened to a long time to a podcast called the survival podcast by a guy named Jack Spirico
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.640]   And I'll give him credit for pointing it out to me is that he pointed out in one of his shows
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:45.400]   He pointed out that the statistics on lifespan are a little bit odd because we're taught that you know back in the 1800s
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.480]   no, but hardly anybody lived to make it to the age of 65 and
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.200]   His point was that that's not true
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.160]   Think of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and many of them lived past
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.100]   Many of them lived past the age of 65
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.480]   And so I thought that was kind of interesting
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.600]   So I went one day and I did a research project just to kind of prove it to myself
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.240]   And I went and I took and I wrote down all the signers of the Declaration of Independence
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.840]   And I calculated their out their average lifespan
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.280]   And the reason I did that is because if you try to figure out okay
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.480]   maybe the general population number was that was that amount but why and
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.040]   So is it the fact that we have great medications now?
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.260]   Or is it the fact that we have dry beds to sleep in?
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:34.160]   Is it the fact that we have awesome hospital services or is it the fact that you know, we have that we have adequate food?
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.640]   What's the actual answer here as far as?
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   What's the answer and I'm certainly not sure of the answer. I don't know
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.920]   I certainly don't know what the actual answer is, but I did go and do this interesting
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.840]   Chart and I'll share it with you
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   I looked made a list of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence and I calculated their average age and
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:03.080]   The average age of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence ended up being sixty seven point five years
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.420]   I took out the one so but however, obviously when you read through why different people died
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:17.020]   You have accidents you have old age. And so I took out one signer who died at age 30 of shipwreck
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:24.740]   That was the one that that was the one that was an accident that was very clear that raised the average lifespan to 68
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.320]   Point two so the average lifespan of these people was sixty eight point two
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.080]   If you look down the list and I just pulled it up here on my computer
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.600]   If you look down the list some of the oldest ones
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.520]   Well, I'll just give you a few so Josiah Bartlett died at 65 and a half from poor health and heart poor health poor health
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.320]   So that would be kind of the normal old age old age William Whipple died at fifty five point not
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   So he's sixty years old from heart disease is he had clogged arteries
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.000]   Matthew Thornton died at 89 while visiting his daughter
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.840]   John Adams died at 90 of a coma. He died while in a coma
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.360]   Samuel Adams died of at 81 from severe lung hemorrhage
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.420]   Elbridge Gary died at 70 in it
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.480]   Excuse me. I'm looking at my chart wrong Samuel Adams
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.880]   It doesn't list the cause of death here and my notes that I took Elbridge Gary died at 70 John Hancock at 46
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.480]   I'll skip I'm not gonna read all of these just a few noted ones Francis Lewis died at 89
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.600]   Benjamin Franklin died at 84
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.760]   James Smith died at 87
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Charles Carroll died at 95
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.880]   Thomas Stone died at 44
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.360]   Some of the older ones George Wythe died at 80 and so you have a broad range of these people dying it
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   You know relatively normal ages
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:53.320]   Seems like one of the interesting things is that the gout was a major a major factor at that point in time
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.800]   and
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.880]   And that really affected a lot of these people's health health, but the point is I'm not sure
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.320]   It's something if anybody has any knowledge share it with me
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.680]   I'm interested in researching this because I personally think that it's like it's possible
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.720]   That a lot of the increases in lifespan are just simply due to the more widespread
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.240]   the the greater prevalence of
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.360]   You know a warm bed to sleep in at night to keep the rain off and enough food for people to eat
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:28.120]   Rather than you know this idea that I've had in the past that that it's just simply that you know amazing medicine
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.360]   I think it's much more basic than that probably the discovery of germ theory and
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.960]   Warm beds to sleep in and enough food and enough nutrition is a compelling
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.360]   compelling
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.280]   Idea another article here that I think these articles do a good job of laying out in a short version
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.400]   Kind of the history of retirement so this article is from the Seattle Times
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.360]   published December 31
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:57.560]   2013 and I don't see the author listed here at least not on the top this one's relatively short a brief history of retirement
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.480]   It's a modern idea
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.880]   Work until you die or until you can't work anymore
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   Until the late 19th century that was the old age plan for the bulk of the world's workers
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.960]   Only in 1889 did German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced modern pensions
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.280]   Bismarck wasn't really motivated by compassion for the plight of the working class
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:21.800]   He wanted to present preempt a growing socialist movement in Germany before it grew any more powerful
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:30.520]   The idea of providing financial security for the aged gradually caught on and expanded in Europe the United States and other advanced economies
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:37.040]   Now as life expectancy reaches links Bismarck couldn't have imagined and retirement lasts two or three decades
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.320]   These countries are struggling with government pension plans
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.800]   They can no longer afford the pension Bismarck offered was the first to be widely available
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.440]   But it was hardly the world's first in
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:54.960]   13 BC the Roman Emperor Augustus began paying pensions to Roman legionnaires who had served 20 years
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.000]   The troops pensions were financed at first by regular taxes then by a 5% inheritance tax
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.080]   according to a 2009 history by Frank Ike an
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.240]   Economist now with the International Monetary Fund in the 16th century
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:15.120]   Britain and several European countries offered pensions to their troops starting with officers and gradually expanding to enlisted men
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:21.320]   the first civilian public servant known to have received a pension was an official with the London Port Authority in
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.660]   1684 he was paid half his working income deducted from the pay of his replacement
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:34.380]   Thomas Paine the Revolutionary War firebrand famous for his essay common sense called for a 10%
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.720]   inheritance tax
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.640]   Part of the tax was be used to pay benefits to everyone aged 50 and older to guard quote guard against poverty in
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.600]   Old age according to a history by the Social Security Administration
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.360]   The idea went nowhere
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.840]   After the Civil War the US government paid pensions to disabled or impoverished Union veterans or to the widows of the dead
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:01.560]   Southern states paid pensions to disabled Confederate veterans the Civil War pensions became a basis for Social Security decades later
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:07.960]   When farming dominated the economy most men worked as long as their health held out as they aged though
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.940]   They often cut their hours and turned the most physically demanding chores over to sons or hired hands in
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.320]   1880 when half of Americans worked on a farm
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:25.520]   78% of American men worked past age 65 as factories began to replace farms and economic importance
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.600]   Skeptics wondered whether old folks could understand and work with the new machines
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.120]   one of the giants of American medicine Johns Hopkins
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.200]   Johns Hopkins Hospital co-founder William Osler in
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   1805 decried quote the uselessness of men older than 60 and said they should leave the workforce
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.240]   Growing prosperity also meant more people could afford to stop working late in life in
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:57.920]   1875 American Express offered America's first employer provided retirement plan five years later the Baltimore and Ohio
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.680]   Railroad introduced the first retirement plan
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.400]   financed jointly by contributions from an employer and its workers
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:11.940]   From their private pension plans grew in the United States the plans received a boost during World War two when the government imposed wage
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:17.680]   Freezes that led some companies to offer pensions and other benefits to attract scarce workers
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.400]   That was a key a key development in retirement plan history right there
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:29.120]   Is that they weren't able to pay more wages? So the employers came and built up other?
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   other ways of
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:39.280]   Compensation which which really helped with fringe benefits so pension contributions other ancillary fringe benefits health plans, etc
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.440]   Made a big difference there when that when that happened the United States created Social Security in
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.400]   1935 and added Medicare health benefits for the elderly in
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:53.380]   1965 in the 1980s many countries lowered the age at which people could retire and collect full benefits
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:16:00.200]   This step was part of an effort to clear older workers out of the labor force to make way for the young
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:08.260]   And a pause and emphasize this in the 1980s many countries lowered the age at which people could retire and collect full benefits
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:14.000]   This step was part of an effort to clear older workers out of the labor force to make way for the young
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.480]   One of the things that I found
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.880]   researching retirement is that retirement has usually been used as punishment and
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.720]   I think it'll be tomorrow when I go into some of the detailed history
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:31.420]   From this book a history of retirement. It's very interesting to see that a retirement was originally intended
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:36.520]   There's many reasons why but one of the major factors originally intending
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:42.840]   Excuse me originally affecting retirement was that retirement was intended to solve an employment problem and the idea was that
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.280]   economically speaking with
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.080]   Industrialization it was never going to be possible to have full employment and especially during the Great Depression
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.240]   The policymakers had decided it was never going to be possible again to have full employment
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.600]   And so they needed to reduce the number of people that were unemployed
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:05.080]   But one of the fastest ways that they chose to do that was to introduce and mandate late at later dates
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:11.520]   The concept of retirement and so retirement was originally intended as a solution to the problem of employment
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:19.600]   That's key. Don't rely on my statement. So I'll try to prove it to you tomorrow with with some better researched information
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:27.200]   finishing this article now governments are reversing those policies and raising retirement ages to prevent aging populations from breaking their budgets and
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.320]   Older older people who now enjoy better health are working longer again in the United States
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.920]   18.6 percent of people 65 and older were working or looking for work as of November
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.080]   That was up from a record low ten point four percent in January 1985
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.520]   according to Labor Department figures dating to
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.880]   1948
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.960]   Why on earth do we have these constant articles decrying the
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.160]   the retirement crisis
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.800]   Many older people are enjoying work are working longer again
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.760]   So we're going to talk about kind of some alternate ways because from a financial planning perspective
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.600]   This opens up a huge huge huge number of opportunities
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:18.000]   for us to kind of reinvent basically reinvent the entire concept if you could if we can get free of this concept of
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.560]   Work for my lifetime and then I have to retire at 65 if we can get free of this concept
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.320]   Then we can completely re-engineer our lives in some really awesome ways and we can take control of it again
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.880]   Over the over the years of working as a financial planner. I've asked hundreds of people
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.680]   This question is kind of part of my standard fact-finding process
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.400]   and the question is this is there a point in time at which you'd like to be in a position to not to have to
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.920]   work if you didn't want to and kind of phrase it like that to try to not be
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.280]   critical of you know
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.480]   Do you want to retire to try to kind of phrase it a little more?
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.360]   elegantly or you know, is there a point you just like to work because you choose to not because you want to and
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.160]   Almost universally I get one of three answers. There are exceptions
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.800]   The most common answer is oh, yeah, definitely
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.600]   The follow-up question is what age when do you want to do that?
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.760]   You know 65 that's the by far the most common answer. I'm gonna make up some some percentages on the spot here
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.060]   I would say that's probably 50% of the time
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:22.880]   The second most common answer is no. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I'd like to have money but no, I'm never gonna quit
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.520]   You mean retire? I'm not gonna quit and that answer is probably the second most common. I make up a number that's 30%
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:36.200]   Well, let's say 20% and then the third most common answer is yeah, absolutely at what age, you know
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.120]   Maybe a little bit early like 60 and that's probably another 20%
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.000]   So if I got my statistic if I if I made up my percentages appropriately, that's 90%
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   The other 10% has various answers
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.840]   And I always push back and say why why 65?
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.600]   I don't know, you know
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:59.220]   That's a good age, right? That's the Social Security age, you know, that's when I get collect collect Social Security
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.460]   and
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:06.020]   The thing I always I just feel like is a big deal to push back on is why are we choosing the age of 65?
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.720]   Why
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.860]   Why not 66? Why not 64? Why not 44? Why not 94?
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:19.500]   I don't care what you choose, but don't just choose the answer because that's the convenient answer
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.560]   Don't just say I'm gonna make this retirement plan because here's what happens
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.080]   I take that number and I go and create a written financial plan and it shows that by the age of 65 you need
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.680]   You know 1.4 million dollars and I come back and I deliver the financial plan and I talk you through it
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.480]   But the reality isn't door to accumulate the 1.4 million dollars
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.340]   You got to be saving a thousand bucks a month and then we don't follow through and do the savings
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.300]   so
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.240]   We got to change that
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240]   Begin we got to create
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:53.200]   Individualized plans that are really compelling and so whether that's I'm gonna I'm gonna take a year off every 10
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.580]   Whether that's I'm gonna work, you know and get early retirement
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:03.720]   I'm gonna you know, I don't know what what the answer is, but I mean there's lots of answers to it
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.900]   I'll give you one of one of mine. This is me speaking personally
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:10.280]   This whole retire at 65 thing has never made sense to me
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:15.780]   And the reason it doesn't make sense to me primarily is because of you know, my personal family values
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:20.320]   So I look at it and I say why on earth should I do this?
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.000]   So go to school Joshua graduate from high school go to college go to college
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.900]   You know get a get a degree get out get a good job. Okay, I'm gonna get a good job now
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.980]   Now you need to really work hard on your job
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.660]   So you should also however get married when you're in your early 20s and you should start a family
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:38.760]   So now that's the career building time and that's when you've got a family you need to work really really hard
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.540]   So you have a bunch of money saved up so that at the age of 65 you can retire
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.540]   So I work from let's call it, you know, let's say I got married and had kids at 25
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:52.500]   So I work from 25 to 45 during those 20 most crucial years really building my career
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.260]   I'm a workaholic always, you know, just slaving away at the office to allow me to save money and I miss my kids
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.560]   Like, you know my kids childhood
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.960]   So I go to some soccer games from time to time and I get home at about 8 o'clock at night because I'm living on
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.840]   An airplane, but I miss my kids childhood because I got to build my career and I got to save for retirement
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.340]   So then about the age of 45, I'm ready to pull back a little bit
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.380]   But now I look down and my kids are 14 years old
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.540]   They don't want anything to do with me because I wasn't there and now they're 14 years old
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.800]   They're trying to establish their independence
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.200]   And so here I am at the age of 45 and now I'm senior enough in my company
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.800]   That I can afford to pull back a little bit of all my time
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.800]   And so I do that but the problem is they don't care much about me
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.700]   And then I keep working and I retire at 65 right when my kids are, you know, 25 years old
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:38.200]   And they're the ones that are working, you know, 25 to- they're in their 25 to 45 years old
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.200]   And they're working to build their careers doing exactly what they watched me do
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.400]   So I'm 65 so I can afford to sit around and do nothing
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.600]   But my kids don't want anything to do with me so I have to go play non-stop
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.600]   It doesn't make any sense to me
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.800]   Why not, you know, just a very simple alternate plan
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.000]   Why not simply say, okay, I'm gonna, you know, graduate from college, you know, 22 or whatever
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.600]   Work really hard for a few years, save a bunch of money
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.200]   But then all during the time that my kids are growing up, why don't I pull back from the work?
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.000]   Why don't I pull back and spend time being present with them?
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.400]   And then once the kids are starting to kind of establish their independence, they're 14 years old
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.000]   Why not at that point in time then really pour on the effort at work?
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   And forget this whole 65 thing
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.400]   Why not just simply build a lifestyle and a career that allows me to integrate fully my life and my work?
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.800]   If it's good enough for Mr. Marriott and Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, why is it not good enough for the rest of us?
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.000]   Now, there are a lot of alternate plans
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   So I love the early retirement concept
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   The concept that, you know, for example, Money Mustache
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Hopefully we'll have him on the show at some point, I'd love to interview him
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.600]   But Money Mustache talks about he and his wife's plan
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.000]   Their plan was to retire by the time they had kids
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.200]   So they did it at 31
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.200]   That's awesome!
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.800]   How cool is that? That works
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.400]   And now they're both home full-time raising their son
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.800]   That's an awesome plan
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.200]   It's a lot smarter than doing it at 65
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:08.000]   So there are a number of different plans that we have
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.800]   But once we get out of this age 65 thing
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.600]   Then we create a dramatically different financial planning options
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.400]   I'll read this article here, very short
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.200]   But to me this is the constant
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.000]   And over the next couple of decades it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.600]   As the government balances, the government debt balances get worse and worse and worse
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.800]   Here's the constant refrain, this is from the BBC News
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.000]   "Thinking of the Bismarck legacy"
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.200]   "Otto von Bismarck was the Prime Minister of Prussia before overseeing the unification of Germany
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.600]   The German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced the world's first state pension system in the 1880s
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:54.000]   You had to be 70 years old and the expectation was that you would probably only live a few years after that to collect it
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.200]   But in 1916 they lowered the pensionable age to age 65
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.000]   It has remained at 65 for almost a century
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.200]   And it will take a brave government to juggle with the political sensitivity of raising that age again
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.000]   "It is a part of our political system and we pay for it
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.800]   The employees, the employers and the state"
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   Says Wolfgang Wipperman at the Berlin Free University
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.400]   "They have to continue with this
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.000]   Otherwise there will be a revolution of the pensioners"
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.600]   Bleak future
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.600]   But 9 out of 10 old people around the world do not have a pension
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.800]   And for many of those lucky 1 in 10 who do, these are worrying times
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:39.600]   Sinking portfolio values and demographic changes are forcing cash-strapped governments to consider fundamental reforms
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.000]   Bismarck designed the system in 1881 and it came into force at the end of that decade
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.400]   In a very different world from the current one
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.000]   Old people are living longer than they were 50 years ago, blah blah blah
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.600]   Today there are 4 working Germans paying the pensions of every retired person
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:00.200]   But by the time today's youngest workers retire, there will be only 2
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.800]   You don't need to know anything more than that
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   The system is going to change
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.400]   So instead of having these whiny articles constantly about how we got to adjust things
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.600]   Instead of us financial planners yelling at people saying "You got to save another percentage"
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:20.000]   We need to find a new way of tackling this problem
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.600]   And the best way I know how to tackle it is with the concept of lifestyle design
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:32.400]   Now lifestyle design to the best of my knowledge was popularized more recently by Tim Ferriss in his book
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.400]   In his book "The 4-Hour Workweek"
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.000]   And he designed it, which is a great idea
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   But I would maintain that all people design their lifestyle
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.800]   Whether they do it intentionally knowing the idea of lifestyle design or not
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.400]   All people still design their lifestyle
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:58.200]   Why does one person choose to go to welding school and why does another person choose to become a horse farrier?
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.600]   One I would assume likes horses and the other I would assume likes welders
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.600]   So that's designing a lifestyle
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:12.200]   But the key is that we've got to apply this lifestyle design to every aspect of life
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.600]   Bill Gates has a lifestyle that I think is really really neat
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   Not because of the private jet and the big house, to me, fine, good for him
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.600]   To me the fact that he gets to sit around and read books all day is my...
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:32.600]   To me that's an idea, read books and watch videos and talk to people and solve great problems
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.600]   In my mind that's one of the world's greatest things you could do
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   That would be the most fun thing you can do
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.600]   That's why I'm creating a podcast, it's lifestyle design
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.600]   And any one of us can do it now if we integrate it
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   So we've got to integrate the lifestyle design and the goal setting
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.600]   And figure out an individualized plan which will be different for each one of us
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   One person may say I want to work till 65
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.600]   Another person may say I want to quit at 45
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   Another person say I never want to quit
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.600]   Doesn't matter what your answer is as long as you know what it is
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:11.600]   I think that's enough for today, a longer show today
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.600]   Tomorrow I plan to come back and continue on this retirement program
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600]   And we're going to continue with...
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   I'm going to read at length from this book, A History of Retirement
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.600]   Because it gives some background I think that is so crucial to understand the world today
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   I had to go and learn this from books because I wasn't around
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.600]   But I've never heard anybody kind of reference this history
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   Once you reference this history and once you understand that retirement is not this end all be all of leisure
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.600]   That this is a very new concept
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.600]   It allows you to feel good about making alternate plans
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   And I really believe that the idea of leisure being the goal
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.600]   We see through that for the most part
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.600]   We've all been on a vacation that's kind of like we're ready to be off a vacation when we're done with it
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   That's something that I think we've all experienced
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.600]   However, there's so much noise in the media
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.600]   There's so much noise in all of these articles that come across Yahoo Finance everyday
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   And USA Today finance section about how we're supposed to beat ourselves up for not saving for retirement
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.600]   It's okay to not save for retirement
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.600]   It's fine
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   Now, let me be clear
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   I save for retirement
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.600]   But the point is that just saving in a 401k
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.600]   On this arbitrary idea of I've got to save for retirement may not be the best way to do it
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   The best thing to do sometimes may be to cash out that 401k and go start the business
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   Warren Buffett didn't become rich by saving in an IRA
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.600]   Conrad Hilton didn't become rich by saving in an IRA
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.600]   And I'll just finish with this
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   I just want to point this out
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:00.600]   One of my biggest frustrations with the financial media is that a lot of the advice just simply doesn't work
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.600]   It's lies
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   Now, it's not lies in the normal way that lie is defined
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.600]   It's not actually untrue
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.600]   It's that it just doesn't work
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:17.600]   The idea that, well, you know what, if you'll just save $200 a month into a Roth IRA, you're going to be rich
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   Is that true?
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   Maybe
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   There is no mathematical reason why that can't be true
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   If you will save $200 a month
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.600]   Just a second, I've got to get my calculator
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   If you will save $200 a month
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   Let's run the numbers here
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   If you will save $200 per month, every month
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   Let's say over a 40-year period of time
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.600]   40 years
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   And we do this
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.600]   Let's just plug in 10% interest and start with nothing
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   Yes, at the end of 40 years, you will have $1,264,815
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.600]   That is absolutely true
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.600]   And there's no reason why you can't do more than that
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   If you save $400 a month
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.600]   At the end of 40 years, you will have $2,500,000
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   So $400 a month over a 40-year career is $2,500,000
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   Which considering, what was that statistic that I read?
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.600]   29% of retirees have less than $1,000
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   And only 11% have more than $250,000
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.600]   That will put you there
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.600]   So I was mistaken
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   So current retirees, 17% have $250,000 or more
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.600]   So yes, $400 a month into a Roth IRA
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.600]   Will in fact, if you go to my 10% number
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.600]   Will indeed get you there
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.600]   Let's plug in 8%
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:37.600]   And 8%, you're at $1,400,000
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.600]   So you're in that top echelon of retirees with money
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.600]   But look at the people that are in the Forbes 400
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.600]   None of them ever got there by saving for retirement
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.600]   And look at the fact that
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600]   Excuse me, in an IRA
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   Look at the fact that only 17% of retirees have more than $250,000
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   So what about the rest of them?
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.600]   What's wrong with taking that and starting a business?
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   What's wrong with taking that and investing in other ways?
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   I love Roth IRAs
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   I think they're one of the most incredibly flexible accounts
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   But it's not the end all be all
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   It's okay to do other things with the money
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   So we'll talk about that on another day
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.600]   Hopefully today has been interesting
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.600]   I really appreciate you listening
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   To close out here, just a couple of comments
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.600]   I'm going to say this once and I'm going to try not to
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.600]   Apologize a lot in the future about this stuff
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.600]   I don't expect my
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.600]   A lot of times podcasts are expected to be short
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   I'm here at an hour and a half
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   I don't have any predicted time for the show
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   Whether that's 20 minutes or 1 hour and 45 minutes
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   If you're bored with what we're talking about
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   Just feel free, just turn it right off
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.600]   That won't bother me a bit if you turn the show off
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   If there's something you want to completely skip, skip
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   Pick and choose what you find interesting
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   I do my best to try to present things in a way that I think are interesting
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.600]   But it won't bother me a bit if you just shut it off and move on
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.600]   Love to hear your comments on today's show
