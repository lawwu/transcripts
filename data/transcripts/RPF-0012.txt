[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:51.680]   That's a safe one.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.220]   Good, I hope you both never quit.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.500]   Have you thought about that at all?
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020]   I'm sure you think about it.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.500]   I think Warren is much more,
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.180]   uh, fixed in his mind about what he's going to do.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.680]   And that's why when people say,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.780]   well, we ought to write a story
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.560]   about who's going to succeed Warren Buffett,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240]   I say, you know, it's just kind of ridiculous to say that
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.540]   because he isn't going to retire.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.020]   And if he doesn't retire,
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.840]   if he, say he runs Berkshire 10 years more,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.960]   the whole set of people who might succeed him
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.840]   will have changed.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.440]   And so it's ridiculous to write a story about that.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.760]   I agree.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.980]   It's very simple.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.480]   The, uh...
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.560]   You know, I'm having the time of my life.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.200]   At some point, your mind goes.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.120]   I mean, and I've told my kids,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.860]   I think it was David Ogilvie that says,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900]   develop your peculiarities when you're young.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.160]   That way when you get older,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.460]   people won't think you're going gaga.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.460]   So I did that.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.840]   I followed that advice.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.860]   But my children will come in to me at some point.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.600]   I've told all three to come in at the same time
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840]   and tell me, you know, you're going gaga, daddy.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.900]   And if only one of them comes in,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.460]   they're out of the will.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.940]   So they have to come in and ask.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.540]   But it's...
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.760]   Uh-huh.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.680]   The truth is,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.000]   in terms of managing money
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.480]   or even managing a business,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.560]   depending on the nature of the business
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.700]   and the way it's managed,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300]   age really isn't much of a deterrent.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.440]   It's a deterrent to everything else.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.300]   I mean, you know, I mean,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200]   in terms of eye-to-eye coordination,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.460]   balance, all kinds of things.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.840]   But in terms of getting the most out of other people,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.320]   which is what my job is,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.760]   and in terms of allocating capital,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.980]   so far it hasn't been a deterrent.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.500]   You know, who knows what happens next week.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.840]   But you have a contingency plan.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   In terms of governance.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   Oh, it's total.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.900]   I mean, if I die tonight,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.360]   tomorrow morning there will be a CEO named...
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.060]   Every board knows exactly who it is.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.760]   If for some reason that person's unavailable,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.700]   they know another one.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.340]   I mean, it's what we spend a majority of our time on.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.040]   You have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.460]   And it's totally true.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.700]   And the reason is because it's so hard
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.000]   that if you don't,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   any rational person would give up.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.760]   It's really hard.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.300]   And you have to do it over a sustained period of time.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.460]   So if you don't love it,
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.020]   if you're not having fun doing it,
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.100]   you don't really love it,
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.780]   you're going to give up.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.660]   And that's what happens to most people, actually.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.220]   If you really look at the ones that ended up,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.840]   you know, being successful, unquote,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.740]   in the eyes of society,
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.420]   and the ones that didn't,
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.340]   oftentimes it's the ones that are successful
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.120]   loved what they did so they could persevere
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.940]   when it got really tough.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.520]   And the ones that didn't love it quit.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.900]   Because they're sane.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.400]   Right?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.660]   Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it?
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.660]   So it's a lot of hard work.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.140]   And it's a lot of worrying constantly.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.140]   And if you don't love it, you're going to fail.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140]   So you've got to love it.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.140]   You've got to have passion.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.140]   And I think that's the high order bit.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.140]   The second thing is you've got to be a really good talent scout.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.140]   Because no matter how smart you are,
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.140]   you need a team of great people.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.140]   And you've got to figure out how to size people.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.660]   Right?
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.160]   Size people up fairly quickly.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160]   Make decisions without knowing people too well.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   And hire them.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   And see how you do.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   And refine your intuition.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   And be able to help build an organization
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   that can eventually just build itself.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Because you need great people around you.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.660]   I want to talk about the fact that this is my last keynote.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.660]   And it's the middle of this year in July.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.420]   And I'm going to talk about the fact that I moved from being a full-time employee at Microsoft
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420]   to working full-time at the foundation, as you heard.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.420]   And so this will be the first time since I was 17
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.420]   that I won't have my full-time Microsoft job.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.420]   And I'm not really sure what that last day is going to be like.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.420]   It could be a bit strange.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.420]   What do you do on your last day?
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.420]   So I asked some friends to help me prepare for that.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.180]   And so we got together and did a little video.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.180]   So let's take a look at that.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:09.180]   It is a day the industry never thought would come.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.180]   Join us all day as we report on Bill Gates' last full day at Microsoft.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   It's been in the planning for the past two years.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.180]   He'll still be active as chairman.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.180]   It's hard to believe it's really here.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.940]   Yeah, I think Bill's ready for his last day.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940]   He's worked pretty hard, saved a little bit.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.940]   He is completely focused.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.940]   I mean, Bill's been going all out for more than 30 years.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:47.940]   So not having a completely full schedule every day has been a little, well, interesting.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   Never doubt the magic of software.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.940]   That's right, listen to Chewbacca.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   You know, after all these years, he's finally taking work-life balance seriously.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   He's even got a personal trainer.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   All right, that's good. One in a row.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   When you keep this up, you're gonna get sexiest man alive next year, bro.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   That's good for the set, man. You wanna let it go or you wanna keep going?
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   Well, am I ready to take my shirt off?
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   Um, not yet.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   Feel yourself going back, lean a little forward.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   Just think high, H-I, to the sky.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.460]   You and I.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.460]   Right now.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.460]   Yeah, Bill's always been a bit of a ham.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.460]   But more importantly, it's the creative risks he takes that really set him apart.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.460]   Big pimpin', I'm Bill G.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.460]   Big pimpin', yeah, you know me.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.460]   That's it.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.460]   Got it.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   Killed it, Billy G.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.460]   Hey, let me get one thing straight with you.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.460]   You can retire and then un-retire?
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.460]   Exactly.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.220]   Gotta keep 'em guessing.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.220]   Thanks, Jay.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.220]   No, it was great.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.220]   Not so much.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220]   It's hot, though.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.220]   Somebody gotta tell 'em. It was horrible.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.220]   What's new?
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   Here. Just take that.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.220]   Hello, Bill?
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.220]   Bill, I'm a little busy here.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.220]   Dude!
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.220]   Wasn't that the craziest riff you've ever heard?
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.220]   Oh, for f---'s sake.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.220]   Bill, we've, um, we've talked about this before.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220]   Um, we're full up in the band.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.220]   Bill?
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.220]   All positions are filled.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.220]   Uh-huh, huh?
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.220]   I know, I know, but I can't just replace Edge because you got a high score on Guitar Hero, Bill.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.220]   Look, I mean, Bill's always had a passion for guitar.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.220]   Bill's always had a passion for music.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   And as long as it's not my music, I'm fine with that.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.220]   Bill's always been a big fan of the movies.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.220]   But he's probably gone a bit too far with this whole audition reel thing.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.220]   Who are you expecting? Superman?
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220]   Bill, what money can't buy?
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.220]   Oh.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.220]   Yeah, I just watched it.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.220]   Yeah, look, we all know it's all about casting anyway, right?
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.220]   I know, Steven, I can't, it's just, I can't play Bill Gates.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   It's, uh, it's just not something I'm good at.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   I want you, Russell Crowe, to do it.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.220]   You'd be, oh, dead, yeah.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220]   How about Tom Hanks?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.220]   You'd be, you were passed on that one, too.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   Hey, I, I was thinking the last time I was on the show, I, I thought it was really successful.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.220]   Yeah, no, you were great on the show, man. We loved it.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:08.220]   It was, although, you know, you did kind of run off at the end, like I, you know, had monkey pox.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.220]   Windows Vista on sale. Oh, he's leaving!
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.220]   You want to come back on the show? That's fine. That's, uh, you know, we...
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.220]   Maybe we could make it sort of a regular thing, like...
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.220]   You, me, the, the news.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   A co-anchor kind of a situation. It's, it's a great idea.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.220]   I gotta tell you, it's a, it's a great idea.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   It's, uh, the only thing is, I'm on my jet right now, and they...
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   I'm worried the phone will, they have to turn it off or it will throw off the navigation system.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.220]   On the, the ding-ding.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220]   And you didn't hear this from me.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   It's a pretty strange coincidence that his transition date is right in the middle of the 2008 presidential campaign.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.220]   I, I know you're super busy, but I, I'm sure you're starting to think about who would be your best running mate.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:10.220]   No, I, I know I haven't actually declared a running mate yet, Bill, but I'm not sure politics is really for you.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   Hey, it's Bill.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.220]   Bill Shatner of Star Trek?
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.220]   No, the other Bill.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.220]   Bill Clinton?
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.220]   Oh, hey Bill.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   No, it's not an inconvenient time.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.220]   Yeah, I, I get it.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.220]   You know, that was a good one.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   Of course, we'll miss him in the daily brainstorming meetings.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.220]   He's always been an innovator, really inspiring all of us to think creatively about the future.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.220]   And we'll be the first to give credit where credit is due.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.220]   Microsoft Bob?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220]   His idea.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.220]   Yeah, I'm sure he'll be a good friend.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   Microsoft Bob? His idea. All his.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   Like I said, we've been planning for this.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220]   But he's still Bill.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.220]   And we'll miss seeing him in the hallway every day.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   Hey, buddy. See you tomorrow at the board meeting.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:36.400]   And all tech markets remain steady
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.000]   as Bill Gates completed his historic last full day at Microsoft.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.400]   Personal note, all of us here at NBC News will miss reporting every night
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.360]   on this brilliant, powerful, let's face it, sexy and good-looking leader of men and women
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   who just doesn't believe in paying more than $7 for a haircut.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.860]   I'm Brian Williams in New York. Good night.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.380]   You probably know Bill Gates.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.540]   Bill Gates as the founder of Microsoft, the hard-driving tech executive
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.360]   whose software fueled the personal computer revolution.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.600]   You might also know him as the longtime richest man in the world
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.000]   who left Microsoft five years ago so he could work full-time giving his money away.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.540]   We had the chance to witness Bill Gates 2.0, the man you don't know.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.360]   He has driven as much as anyone we have ever met to make the world a better place.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.300]   Gates told us why he thinks
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.060]   inventions are the key to success
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.620]   and just what he intends to accomplish with his time, intellect and $67 billion fortune.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.720]   Starting with his plans to knock out some of the world's deadliest diseases.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.180]   The story will continue in a moment.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:13:02.000]   You're going to spend the next 20 years of your life trying to eradicate disease, yes?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.640]   Yep.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.580]   That's your mission?
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.700]   That'll be the majority of my time.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.720]   Starting with polio?
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.640]   Get it done by 2018.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.700]   Tuberculosis?
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.460]   That one, we'll have to see how the tools go.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.460]   The current tools are not good enough to do an eradication.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.040]   They're good enough to reduce the deaths very dramatically.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.380]   But we'll need a few better tools that'll take probably six or seven years.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.080]   Malaria?
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:35.000]   Malaria is the one that the tools are being invented now, 15 or perhaps even 20 years.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.720]   But start to really shrink that map.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.320]   These are the people Gates wants to help.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.040]   They are what he calls the bottom two billion,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.240]   a third of the world's population that struggles on less than $2 a day.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.800]   They are poor, hungry, lack electricity and clean water.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.980]   Gates' most urgent goal, help the millions of children under five who die every year,
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.580]   one every 20 seconds, from preventable diseases.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.100]   No one alive.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.160]   No one alive.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.640]   that I know of has said, my goal is to eradicate a disease,
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.380]   and then another disease, and then another disease.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.640]   This is somebody that dreams high.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   - Yeah, because I'm excited about that, and it's doable.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.460]   - Today, Gates spends most of his time here
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.460]   at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.340]   He runs it with his father, Bill Sr., and his wife, Melinda,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.980]   whom he credits with being a driving force
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.840]   behind the foundation.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.180]   There are over 1,100 employees to help them decide
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.800]   which programs to fund.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.340]   But Gates still visits sites around the world
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.040]   to see what's working and what's not.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.080]   - I welcome Bill Gates to our school.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.340]   The government of Ghana and all school-age children
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.080]   are grateful for your support.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.980]   - Very well done.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.140]   Great to be here.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.380]   - The grants here go towards school nutrition.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.820]   - This is spinach.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.320]   - Improving agriculture.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.280]   - We don't have enough water in the river.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.780]   - We don't have enough water in the river.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.780]   - And most important to Gates, life-saving vaccines.
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.620]   - There you go.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.460]   Thank you.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.300]   - Yeah.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.140]   - Okay.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.780]   - Well, whenever you see a mother bringing a sick child
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.520]   into a facility, it's easy to relate to,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.480]   what if that was my child?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.060]   You realize how crazy it is that with the world
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.000]   being rich enough to afford all sorts of frivolous things,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   that those basic things still aren't being provided.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.820]   - But providing vaccines throughout the developing world,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.660]   - Yeah. - is a great thing.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.500]   - Yeah.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.360]   - The developing world is no simple task.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.060]   So Gates has set up his foundation to run like Microsoft.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.400]   He insists on strict accounting.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.260]   And when a problem arises,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.600]   he pulls in the best people to find solutions.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.000]   We saw a good example of that when it comes to vaccines.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.380]   To be effective, they need to be kept cold.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.260]   - So this is using electricity.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.920]   - But that's tough in hard to reach areas
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.960]   where refrigerators are rare and unreliable.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.360]   Back in Seattle, Gates turned to scientists
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.660]   at a company called Intellectual Ventures,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.020]   where he is both an investor and an inventor.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.660]   They created a super thermos using the same technology
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.640]   that protects spacecraft from extreme heat.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.420]   Using only a single batch of ice,
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.500]   it can keep vaccines cold for 50 days.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.080]   So here is the thermos.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.980]   - That's right.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.000]   This holds vaccines for over 200 children,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.420]   and it doesn't require any batteries, batteries, batteries,
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.320]   any battery, any energy.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.680]   Its walls have been designed to be such a good thermos
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.260]   that even in very, very hot days,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.160]   inside it will stay cold enough to make the vaccines work.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.380]   And then when you want to take them out,
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.220]   you just go in here,
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.920]   and there's a whole tray of the vaccines.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.240]   You take them out, it records everything you've done with it,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.580]   the temperature.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.500]   So it's a replacement for all those refrigerators
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.820]   that have been so unreliable.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.360]   I mean, just look at this thing.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.800]   When we take it out in the field,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.600]   people go, "Oh, that's amazing.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.060]   You can't do that."
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.040]   - No matter how perfect the vaccine,
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.120]   if you can't get it to the people who need it,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.280]   it ain't doing no good.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.120]   - That's right.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.080]   And now, you know, we need to get it
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.360]   to every child in the world.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   - Gates is betting technology
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.420]   will solve other age-old problems like sanitation.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.300]   Two and a half billion people around the world
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.540]   do not have adequate toilets.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.920]   That means streams and rivers get clogged
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.180]   with debris and human waste,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.300]   becoming breeding grounds for disease.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.560]   - The toilet is one of those things that's like a vaccine,
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.040]   where it really would change the situation.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.940]   - So Gates launched a global competition:
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.240]   design a toilet that works without plumbing.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.840]   - We had over 20 entrants.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.880]   We gave four top prizes.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.280]   Some of them used burning,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.220]   some of them used the laser approach.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.880]   There were quite a few novel ideas
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.040]   of how you reinvent the toilet.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.980]   And so, this was one of the best ideas.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.520]   - It's one of the prototype designs
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.300]   of what a good-looking new toilet would look like.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.880]   It actually processes everything down in here
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.920]   and then recycles water.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.100]   Over the next four or five years,
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.520]   we think we can have a toilet
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.680]   that's every bit as good as the flush toilet.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.380]   - You can learn a lot about what motivates Bill Gates
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.960]   by visiting his private office.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.600]   He showed us why he draws inspiration
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.700]   from the Italian genius Leonardo da Vinci.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.780]   In 1994, Gates bought da Vinci's 500,000
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.440]   year old notebook.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.380]   - He had an understanding of science
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.920]   that was more advanced than anybody of the time.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.260]   The notebook we have here is one
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.160]   where he's thinking about water,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.020]   and he's looking at how it flows
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.560]   when it hits barriers and it goes around,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.460]   comes back together.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.900]   He's actually trying to understand turbulence.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.920]   How should you build a dam?
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.560]   How does it erode away?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.200]   - It cost $30 million at auction,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.900]   making it the most valuable manuscript in the world.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.580]   For Gates,
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.680]   it is priceless.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   - It's an inspiration that one person,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.520]   off on their own,
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.820]   with no positive feedback,
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.300]   nobody ever told him what was right or wrong,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.360]   that he kept pushing himself,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.440]   found knowledge in itself to be a beautiful thing.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.320]   - Gates scoffs at any comparison
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.820]   to the great Leonardo,
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.420]   but a look around his private office
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.360]   reveals a man equally obsessed with understanding his world.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.260]   - Can I look at these?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.080]   - Sure.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.040]   This is the weather one, meteorology.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.380]   - Yeah.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.080]   - The very first course that I watched
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.620]   is this geology course.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.720]   - This is a whole series on the joy of science,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.140]   mathematics, philosophy in the real world.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.560]   - Gates' collection of DVDs contains hundreds of hours
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.980]   of college lectures that this famous Harvard dropout
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.020]   has watched.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.620]   - The more you learn, the more you have a framework
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.840]   that the knowledge fits into.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.880]   - When he's on the road, Gates, who's a speed reader,
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.980]   lugs around what he calls his reading bag.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.180]   When he finishes a book, he posts his thoughts
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.120]   on his website, Gates Notes.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.380]   - What I'll do is I'm reading these books.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.220]   - Oh, look at that.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.060]   - I'll take notes.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.980]   - Oh, these are your notes already.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.820]   - Right.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.660]   - Look at this.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.420]   - No, I love to take notes on books.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.060]   So I just haven't written it up yet.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.360]   - How long will it take to read all of this?
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   - Oh, a long time.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.260]   Thank goodness for vacations.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.740]   I read a lot.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.400]   - But Gates isn't just reading books for pleasure.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.860]   He is determined to use his knowledge
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.980]   to back groundbreaking innovations.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.480]   Take this high-tech zapper.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.920]   It is a laser designed to shoot down
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.420]   malaria-infected mosquitoes in mid-flight.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.460]   And Gates showed us one of his boldest
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.960]   and he says most important ventures,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.600]   a new kind of nuclear reactor.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.500]   It would burn depleted uranium, making it cleaner,
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.940]   safer, and cheaper than today's reactors.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.780]   - And your fuel lasts for 60 years.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.980]   And so during that entire time,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.900]   you don't need to open it up, refuel it.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.780]   You don't need to buy more fuel.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.280]   There's a certain simplicity that comes with this design.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.960]   - And when could it come on stream?
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   - Best case would be to have a prototype around 2022.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.260]   - Bill Gates calls himself an impatient optimist,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.360]   a description his wife, Melinda, says was accurate
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   even when they met over 20 years ago.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.460]   - Melinda, what did you like about him?
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.700]   - Just his curiosity and his optimism about life
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.820]   and this belief that you can change things.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.580]   I mean, he believed that clearly.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.680]   And clearly at Microsoft,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.980]   he was changing the world with software and he knew it.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.080]   - Is the curiosity a shared curiosity
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.920]   or are there different curiosities?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.520]   - Well, we both have curiosity for lots of things.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.120]   Bill, at this stage in our life,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.300]   also gets more time to read than I do,
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.460]   quite honestly, with three kids in the house.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.200]   But the great thing is Bill will go read
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.040]   an entire book about fertilizer.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.160]   And I can tell you, even without three kids in the house,
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.100]   I'm not gonna read a book about fertilizer.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.300]   But he loves to teach.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.740]   And so as long as I have time,
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.140]   we'll spend time talking about that.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.380]   - What is it about a book about fertilizer?
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   I mean, seriously.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.240]   - Fertilizer is very interesting.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.280]   We couldn't feed, a few billion people would have to die
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.260]   if we hadn't come up with fertilizer.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.220]   - How do you find a balance in all this?
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   Father, chairman of a major company, a foundation,
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.800]   and then all these other ventures.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.300]   How's the balance come to you?
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.600]   - I don't mow the lawn.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.700]   - You found somebody to do that?
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.900]   - Absolutely.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.340]   - He's come a long way from that teenage prodigy
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.500]   obsessed with writing computer code.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.180]   Over nearly four decades,
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.280]   we've watched Bill Gates help lead the digital revolution
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.160]   with what he now admits was a fanatic
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.220]   and relentless determination.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.760]   - You guys never understood.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.400]   You never understood the first thing about this.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.900]   - I'm not doozin' this thing.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.500]   - In the early years, there was a demanding guy,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.800]   there was a driven guy, there was an obsessed guy,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.600]   there was some say an arrogant guy.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.440]   Have you changed?
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.180]   - I've certainly learned.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.940]   I've learned to be a little bit more
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.480]   self-centered and not be so selfish.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.560]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.960]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.060]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.500]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.960]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.500]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.160]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.500]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.000]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.440]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.280]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.780]   and not be so selfish.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   I've learned to be a little bit more self-centered.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.880]   - Look, I wouldn't have married Bill
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.020]   if there wasn't a huge heart.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.760]   With all the adjectives you just used
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.920]   about how he drove his career,
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.060]   which was very successful for Microsoft,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.600]   there was an enormous heart always there.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.460]   - No question Gates has softened with age.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.060]   Just listen to how he reflected
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.460]   on his often tumultuous relationship
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.500]   with the late Apple CEO, Steve Jobs.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.300]   - He and I, in a sense, grew up together.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.940]   We were within a year of the same age
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.580]   and we were kind of naively optimistic and built
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.080]   big companies.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.980]   We achieved all of it, and most of it as rivals,
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.960]   but we always retained a certain respect, communication,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.400]   including even when he was sick,
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.320]   I got to go down and spend time with him.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.860]   - And talked about what?
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.860]   - Oh, about what we'd learned, about families, anything.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.300]   - Today, Gates says he gets advice
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.940]   on patience and generosity from his friend Warren Buffett,
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.380]   who seven years ago entrusted the majority
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.620]   of his fortune to the Gates Foundation.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.680]   And from his father, Bill Senior,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.780]   a lawyer who prodded his son into giving his money away.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.400]   - You've said before, this is your hero.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.520]   Why?
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.800]   - Well, my dad has integrity.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.900]   He's got a humble approach to things.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.340]   He's calm and wise about things.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.500]   It's just a huge influence to always, you know,
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.180]   want to live up to a great example.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.180]   - Someone said to me,
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.980]   "Your son may be the most influential person
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.680]   in the 21st century."
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.320]   - I can only say yes.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.720]   - He's determined, as he already has proven,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.760]   that he can dramatically reduce the number of kids
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.540]   under five who die.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.040]   You can't do any better than that, can you?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.860]   - That's right.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.700]   That's right.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.140]   There's no way to be unimpressed about that.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.940]   - You couldn't be more proud.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.980]   - I couldn't be more proud.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.980]   That is exactly true.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   - That is absolutely true.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.180]   - Go to 60minutesovertime.com
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.060]   to hear more about the great rivalry and friendship
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   between...
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:54.500]   - You're working at two companies simultaneously,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.780]   which is kind of extraordinary in itself.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.140]   You have this amazing way of...
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:25:59.780]   You spent...
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.380]   Just talk really quickly about how you balance those two.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.720]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   - Yeah, so I...
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.000]   The only way to do this is to be very disciplined
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.400]   and very practiced.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.100]   And the way I found that works for me is I theme my days.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.660]   So on Monday at both companies,
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.140]   focus on management and running the company,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.480]   which is, you know, we have our directional meeting at Square,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.580]   and we have our OpCom meeting at Twitter.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.580]   I do all my management one-on-ones on that day.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.320]   Tuesday is focused on product.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.220]   Wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.820]   Thursday is focused on developers and partnerships.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.760]   And Friday is focused on the company and the culture
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.960]   and recruiting.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.200]   And Saturday I take off. I hike.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.900]   And then Sunday is reflection, feedback, strategy,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.080]   getting ready for the rest of the week.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.380]   And there's interruptions all the time, but...

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.220]   physical exercise, really not separating
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.020]   the brain and other organs.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.500]   And then I will have, after working out,
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.200]   I'll have a nice big meal and come home.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.840]   And from about, I would say, 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.380]   is generally allocated to spending time with friends.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.460]   And I'll oftentimes have lunch with friends
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.700]   slash business associates.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.320]   They're usually one and the same now.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.720]   And then my most productive writing period,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.000]   and I enjoy writing, as difficult as it is for me,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.140]   my best writing period is from about,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.300]   I would say midnight or 1:00 AM to 3:00, 4:00 AM.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   And so I'll generally sit down with a glass of wine or two,
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.880]   and some tea and write.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.420]   And I'll put on a headset and usually play music
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.900]   off of Pandora, and I'll have a music in the,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.760]   I'm sorry, a movie in the background playing
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   on a big screen TV so that it feels like I'm
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.680]   in a social environment, even though the TV
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.160]   is actually muted.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.580]   So that is my routine.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.760]   - That's pretty interesting.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.100]   I mean, the one thing that really strikes me
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.480]   is how you're able to focus on that writing.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.920]   I mean, do you find it hard to stay away
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.240]   from distractions while you wanna focus?
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.000]   - Well, that's part of the reason I found
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   that I get my best work done between 1:00 and 3:00 or 4:00 AM
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.400]   is that particularly since I'm on the West Coast,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.960]   the options for procrastination and distraction are fewer.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.120]   And whenever possible in my life,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.480]   I try to control my environment
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.420]   rather than control my behavior.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.860]   So I think that's changing your environment
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.820]   and designing your environment,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.140]   and that includes schedule,
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.940]   is oftentimes much more effective than
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.440]   trying to rely on self-discipline for certain things.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.260]   And I've really tried to follow that as much as possible,
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.220]   making it impossible for me to misbehave in other words.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:30.680]   - Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.640]   Welcome to episode 12 of the

[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.200]   Today, we're gonna expose the elephant in the living room.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.580]   Is retirement a complete and utter scam,
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.140]   or is it something that we should be working towards at all?
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.980]   Stay with us.

[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   One way of pushing death away is hard work,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   said Manfred F.R. Ketz-DeVry,
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.820]   who studies management psychology
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.820]   and is the author of a paper titled
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   "Death and the Executive:
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   Encounters with the Stealth Motivator."
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   Work is a way of not thinking about it,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   as opposed to sitting on the golf course
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.820]   and having some drinks.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.820]   It's about finding and having meaning.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   Though there are studies showing that
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820]   the older executives get,
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.820]   the more risk-averse they become,
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.820]   potentially robbing shareholders
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   of big acquisitions that could improve
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.820]   companies' bonds.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   And that's the bottom line.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   That drawback, some experts say,
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.820]   is ignored by corporate boards
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.820]   too worried about pushing out
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.820]   popular figures whose identities
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   would vanish without their jobs.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.820]   A report by the conference board,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.820]   a business research group,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   showed that mandatory retirement policies
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.820]   are now seldom used.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.820]   And the idea of everlasting work
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   is filtering down to the lower executive ranks,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.820]   with surveys by Gallup and others
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   showing that large numbers of baby boomers
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   intend to put off retirement
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.820]   because they find work rewarding,
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.820]   or because their retirement accounts
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.820]   took a beating in the recession.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.820]   Some 10% of organizations now offer
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.820]   some form of phased retirement,
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   according to the Society for Human Resource Management.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.820]   "If you have reasonably good health
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.820]   and a real interest in what you're doing,
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.820]   there is no reason why you can't continue
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.820]   contributing for as long as you can,"
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   said Fred Malek, a close friend of Marriott
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.820]   and former president of the company.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   He's still working at age 77.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.820]   People like Bill are lucky to have that.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.820]   Marriott's everlasting career is somewhat rare
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.820]   when compared to Murdoch, Redstone, and Buffett,
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.820]   all of whom still wield considerable
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.820]   day-to-day control over their companies.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.820]   Marriott stepping away was the subject
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   of intense speculation over the years,
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.820]   especially after his son John
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   left the company in 2005,
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   leaving no other family member ready in age
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.820]   or experience to fill the top job.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   Marriott turned to Arne Sorensen,
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.820]   a young, well-liked executive
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.820]   he had personally groomed.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.820]   Sorensen said he regularly consults with Marriott,
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.820]   whose office is just down the hall
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.820]   at the company's Bethesda, Maryland, headquarters,
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.820]   not because he has to, but because he wants to.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.820]   Marriott, he added, remains deeply interested
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.820]   in hotel operations and isn't shy
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   about bringing up ideas or problems.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.820]   He attends monthly senior staff meetings.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   In Marriott, Sorensen has a counselor
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.820]   with such love and recall for details
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.820]   that in an interview he offered the secret
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.820]   to a famous hot shop's dessert.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.820]   "The key to our hot fudge ice cream cake
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.820]   was to leave a spot in the middle of the cake,
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.820]   on the top, and not cover it with anything,
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.820]   so you could put your whipped cream and cherry
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:58.820]   on a dry spot.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.820]   If you put it on top of the chocolate,
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.820]   it would slide off, and you wouldn't have
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.820]   good ice cream cake."
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.820]   "By hanging around, Marriott is hedging a bit
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.820]   and making sure his successor lands on his feet,"
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.820]   said Donald C. Hambrick, a management professor
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.820]   at Penn State University who has studied
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.820]   lengthy executive tenures.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.820]   "He is showing that he's pulling for Sorensen
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.820]   and doesn't want to leave him high and dry."
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.820]   Asked what he thinks Marriott gets out of his role,
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.820]   Sorensen said, "It keeps him young and active and engaged.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.820]   He's a big competitor. He wants to win."
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.820]   His family thinks they win, too.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.820]   "My dad will never stop working,"
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.820]   said daughter Deborah Marriott Harrison,
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.820]   "and we're happy about that because he would probably
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.820]   curl up in the fetal position and die,
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.820]   because this company has been so much a part of his life."
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   But he's no longer putting in 80 hours a week.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.820]   They get more of him at home.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.820]   "He's less preoccupied and more in the moment,"
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.820]   Harrison said.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.820]   "Earlier this year, Harrison saw him play a game
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   with one of his 15 grandchildren,
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   a fishing expedition with magnets.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.820]   He and his granddaughter played for 45 minutes.
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.820]   Who won?
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.820]   'Are you kidding?' Marriott said, laughing.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   'She won.'"
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.820]   So contrast that article with this article right here.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.820]   This is from a USA Today article on personal finance,
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.820]   published April 1, 2012.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.820]   The writer is Nancy Helmick.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:26.820]   This article pervades just about everywhere you look in the financial world.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.820]   "Retirement:
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.820]   A third have less than $1,000 put away.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.820]   Most people aren't trying to figure out
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.820]   how much they'll need in their golden years.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.820]   Most people have very little tucked away for retirement,
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.820]   and many aren't even trying to figure out
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.820]   how much they'll need later in life,"
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.820]   a new national survey reveals.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.820]   "About 36% of workers have less than $1,000
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.820]   in savings and investments that could be used for retirement,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.820]   not counting their primary residence or defined benefit plans,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.820]   such as traditional pensions,
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.820]   and 60% of workers have less than $25,000,
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   according to a telephone survey of 1,000 workers
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.820]   and 501 retirees from the nonprofit
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.820]   Employee Benefit Research Institute
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.820]   and Greenwald and Associates.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.820]   Only 44% say they or their spouse
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.820]   have tried to calculate how much money
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.820]   they'll need to save by the time they retire
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.820]   so that they can live comfortably in their golden years,"
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.820]   the survey shows.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.820]   "Workers who have done calculations on what they need to save
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.820]   tend to have higher levels of savings
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.820]   than those who haven't crunched the numbers."
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   Interesting little tidbit there in that sentence.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.820]   "There's an incredible difference between those lucky enough
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.820]   to have a retirement plan and those who don't,"
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.820]   says Jack Vander High.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.820]   The Institute's research director and co-author
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.820]   of the 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   "What's really striking is that 73% of those without a retirement plan

[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.820]   which is good for her,
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.820]   To me, that's a good overview of

[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.820]   kind of the situation.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.820]   And the author there, Mary Lou Weissman,
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.820]   writes a couple of important details,
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.820]   especially about the development of retirement in America.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.820]   But a couple of key points I want to point out from that.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.820]   In 1929, the American government
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.820]   in 1951,
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.820]   people still did not want to retire.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.820]   And I feel like this is probably underrepresented
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.820]   in today's world.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.820]   And, you know, I was born in the mid-80s
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.820]   and I grew up in a world
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.820]   thinking, "Well, everyone needs to retire."
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.820]   And all I stuffed into my head was retirement books
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.820]   about how to retire,
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.820]   with retirement kind of being painted as this golden prospect.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.820]   with retirement kind of being painted as this golden prospect.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   I'm not so sure it is.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.820]   And there are lots of strategies of how to deal with it.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   But there are a lot of changes that are happening.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.820]   But there are a lot of changes that are happening.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.820]   And I think that's a quick side trip.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.820]   I kind of mocked this idea
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.820]   that the average person,
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.820]   that the average person,
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.820]   hardly anyone lived to be age 65 in 1883.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   hardly anyone lived to be age 65 in 1883.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:43.820]   I'll give credit for this.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.820]   I listened for a long time to a podcast
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.820]   called "The Survival Podcast"
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.820]   by a guy named Jack Spierka.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.820]   And I'll give him credit for pointing it out to me.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.820]   He pointed out in one of his shows
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.820]   that the statistics on lifespan
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.820]   are a little bit odd.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.820]   Because we're taught that, you know,
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.820]   in the 1800s, hardly anybody lived
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.820]   to make it to the age of 65.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.820]   And his point was that
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.820]   that's not true.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.820]   Think of the signers of the Declaration of Independence
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   and many of them lived past
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.820]   the age of 65.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.820]   And so
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.820]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.820]   So I went one day and I did a research project
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.820]   just to kind of prove it to myself.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:23.820]   And I went and I took and I wrote down
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.820]   all the signers of the Declaration of Independence
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.820]   and I calculated their average lifespan.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.820]   And the reason I did that
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.820]   is because if you try to figure out
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.820]   okay, maybe the general population number
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.820]   was that amount, but why?
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.820]   And so is it the fact
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.820]   that we have great medications now?
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.820]   Or is it the fact that we have dry beds to sleep in?
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.820]   Is it the fact that we have
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.820]   awesome hospital services?
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.820]   Or is it the fact that
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.820]   we have adequate food?
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.820]   What's the actual answer here as far as
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.820]   what's the answer?
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.820]   And I'm certainly not sure of the answer.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.820]   I don't know
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.820]   I certainly don't know what the actual answer is.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   But I did go and do this interesting chart
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   and I'll share it with you.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.820]   I made a list of the 56 signers
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.820]   of the Declaration of Independence
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:09.820]   and I calculated their average age.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.820]   And the average age
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.820]   of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.820]   ended up being 67.5 years.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.820]   I took out the one
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   but however obviously
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   when you read through
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.820]   why different people died
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   you have accidents,
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.820]   you have old age.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.820]   And so I took out one single signer
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.820]   who died at age 30 of shipwreck.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.820]   That was the one that
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.820]   was an accident
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.820]   that was very clear.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   That raised the average lifespan to 68.2.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.820]   So the average lifespan of these people
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.820]   was 68.2.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.820]   If you look down the list
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.820]   and I just pulled it up here on my computer
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   If you look down the list
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   some of the oldest ones
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.820]   well I'll just give you a few.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.820]   So Josiah Bartlett died at 65.5
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.820]   from poor health.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   So that would be kind of the normal old age.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   William Whipple died at
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   65.9
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.820]   so 60 years old from heart disease.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.820]   He had clogged arteries.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.820]   Matthew Thornton died at 89
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   while visiting his daughter.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.820]   John Adams died at 90
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.820]   of a coma.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   Well he died while in a coma.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   Samuel Adams died at 81
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.820]   from severe lung hemorrhage.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   Elbridge Gerry died at 70
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.820]   in a
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.820]   excuse me
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.820]   I'm looking at my chart wrong.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   I'm going to put it in my notes that I took.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   Elbridge Gerry died at 70.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   John Hancock at 56.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   I'm not going to read all of these
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   just a few noted ones.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   Francis Lewis died at 89.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.820]   Benjamin Franklin died at 84.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   James Smith died at 87.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.820]   Charles Carroll died at 95.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.820]   Thomas Stone died at 44.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.820]   Some of the older ones.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.820]   George Wythe died at 80.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.820]   And so you have a broad range of these
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.820]   people dying at
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.820]   relatively normal
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.820]   ages.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.820]   Seems like one of the interesting things is that
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.820]   the gout was a major
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.820]   factor at that
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.820]   point in time.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.820]   And that really affected
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.820]   a lot of these people's health.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.820]   But the point is, I'm not sure.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.820]   If anybody has any knowledge, share it with me.
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.820]   I'm interested in researching this.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   Because I personally think that it's
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.820]   possible that a lot of the increases
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   in lifespan are just simply due to
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.820]   the more widespread
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.820]   the greater prevalence
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   of a warm bed
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   to sleep in at night to keep the rain off
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.820]   and enough food for people to eat.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.820]   Rather than
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.820]   this idea that I've had in the past
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.820]   that it's just simply
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.820]   amazing medicine.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   I think it's much more basic than that.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.820]   Probably the discovery of germ theory
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.820]   and warm beds to sleep in and
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.820]   enough food and enough nutrition is a
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.820]   compelling
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   idea.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.820]   Another article here that I think these articles
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.820]   do a good job of laying out in a short version.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   The history of retirement.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.820]   This article is from the Seattle Times.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.820]   Published December 31, 2013.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.820]   And I don't see the author
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.820]   listed here. At least not on the top.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.820]   This one's relatively short.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.820]   A brief history of retirement. It's a modern idea.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.820]   Work until you die
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   or until you can't work anymore.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.820]   Until the late 19th century, that was the
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   old age plan for the bulk of the world's workers.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.820]   Only in 1889
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   did German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.820]   introduce modern pensions.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.820]   Bismarck wasn't really motivated by compassion
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.820]   for the plight of the working class.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   He wanted to preempt a growing
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   socialist movement in Germany before it
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.820]   grew any more powerful.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.820]   The idea of providing financial security
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.820]   for the aged gradually caught on
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.820]   and expanded in Europe, the United States
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.820]   and other advanced economies.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.820]   Now, as life expectancy reaches
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.820]   links Bismarck couldn't have imagined
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.820]   and retirement lasts two or three
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.820]   decades, these countries are struggling
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.820]   with government pension plans they can no
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.820]   longer afford. The pension
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.820]   Bismarck offered was the first to be widely
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   available, but it was hardly the world's
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.820]   first. In 13 BC,
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.820]   the Roman Emperor Augustus
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.820]   began paying pensions to Roman
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.820]   legionnaires who had served 20
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.820]   years. The troops' pensions were
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.820]   financed at first by regular taxes,
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.820]   then by a 5% inheritance tax,
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.820]   according to a 2009 history
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   by Frank Eich, an economist
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.820]   now with the International Monetary Fund.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:23.820]   In the 16th century,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.820]   Britain and several European countries offered
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   pensions to their troops, starting with
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.820]   officers and gradually expanding to enlisted
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.820]   men. The first civilian
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.820]   public servant known to have received
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.820]   a pension was an official with the London Port
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.820]   Authority. In 1684, he
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   was paid half his working income,
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.820]   deducted from the pay of his replacement.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.820]   Thomas Paine, the Revolutionary
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.820]   War firebrand, famous
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.820]   for his essay Common Sense,
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   called for a 10% inheritance
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.820]   tax. Part of the tax was
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.820]   to be used to pay benefits to everyone
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.820]   age 50 and older to "guard against
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.820]   poverty in old age,"
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.820]   according to a history by the Social Security
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.820]   Administration. The idea went nowhere.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.820]   After the Civil War, the U.S.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.820]   government paid pensions to disabled
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.820]   or impoverished Union veterans, or
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.820]   to the widows of the dead. Southern
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.820]   states paid pensions to disabled
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.820]   Confederate veterans. The Civil War
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.820]   pensions became a basis for Social Security
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   decades later. When farming
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.820]   dominated the economy, most men worked
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.820]   as long as their health held out.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   As they aged, though, they often cut
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   their hours and turned the most physically
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.820]   demanding chores over to sons
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.820]   or hired hands. In 1864,
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.820]   1980, when half of Americans worked
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.820]   on a farm, 78%
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.820]   of American men worked past
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.820]   age 65. As
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   factories began to replace farms and
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.820]   economic importance, skeptics wondered
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.820]   whether old folks could understand and work
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.820]   with the new machines. One of the
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.820]   giants of American medicine, Johns
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.820]   Hopkins Hospital
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   co-founder William Osler,
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.820]   in 1905
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.820]   decried "the uselessness"
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.820]   of men older than 60
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.820]   and said they should leave the work
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   force. Growing prosperity
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.820]   also meant more people could afford to stop
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   working late in life.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.820]   In 1875, American Express offered
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.820]   America's first employer-provided
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.820]   retirement plan. Five years later,
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.820]   the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.820]   introduced the first retirement plan,
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.820]   financed jointly by contributions
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.820]   from an employer and its workers.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.820]   From there, private pension plans grew.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.820]   In the United States, the plans received
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.820]   a boost during World War II, when
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.820]   the government imposed wage freezes.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.820]   That led some companies to offer pensions,
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.820]   and other benefits to attract
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.820]   scarce workers. That was a key
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.820]   development in retirement plan history
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.820]   right there.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.820]   They weren't able to pay more wages,
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.820]   so the employers
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   came and built up
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.820]   other
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.820]   ways of compensation,
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.820]   which really helped with
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.820]   fringe benefits. So pension contributions,
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.820]   other ancillary fringe benefits, health
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   plans, etc. made a big difference
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   there when that happened.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.820]   The United States created Social Security in 1935
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.820]   and added Medicare health benefits
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.820]   for the elderly in 1965.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.820]   In the 1980s, many countries lowered
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.820]   the age at which people could retire
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.820]   and collect full benefits. This step was
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.820]   part of an effort to clear older
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.820]   workers out of the labor force
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.820]   to make way for the young.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.820]   I'm going to pause and emphasize this.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   In the 1980s, many countries lowered
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.820]   the age at which people could retire
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.820]   and collect full benefits.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.820]   This step was part of an effort to clear
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.820]   older workers out of the labor force
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.820]   to make way for the young.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   One of the things that I found
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.820]   researching retirement is that
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.820]   retirement has usually been used as punishment.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.820]   I think it will be tomorrow
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.820]   when I go into some of the detailed history
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:41.820]   from this book,
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   A History of Retirement. It's very interesting
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.820]   to see that retirement was originally
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.820]   intended, there's many
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.820]   reasons why, but one of the major
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.820]   factors originally intending,
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.820]   excuse me, originally affecting retirement
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.820]   was that retirement was intended to solve an employment
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.820]   problem. The idea was
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.820]   that, economically speaking, with
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.820]   industrialization, it was never
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   going to be possible to have full employment.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.820]   Especially during the Great Depression,
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   the policy makers had decided
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.820]   it was never going to be possible again to have
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.820]   full employment. So they needed to reduce
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.820]   the number of people that were unemployed.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.820]   One of the fastest ways that they
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   chose to do that was to introduce
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.820]   and mandate at later
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.820]   dates the concept of retirement.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.820]   Retirement was originally
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.820]   intended as a solution to the problem
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.820]   of employment.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.820]   That's key. Don't rely on my
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.820]   statement, so I'll try to prove it to you
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.820]   tomorrow with some better research
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.820]   information. Finishing this article,
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.820]   now governments are reversing those policies
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.820]   and raising retirement ages to prevent
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.820]   aging populations from breaking their budgets.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.820]   And older people who
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.820]   now enjoy better health are working longer
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.820]   again. In the United States, 18.6%
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.820]   of people 65 and
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.820]   older were working, or looking for
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.820]   work as of November. That was up
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.820]   from a record low 10.4%
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.820]   in January 1985, according
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:59.820]   to Labor Department figures dating to
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   1948.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.820]   Why on
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.820]   earth do we have these constant
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:07.820]   articles decrying
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   the
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.820]   retirement crisis?
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.820]   Many older people are
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.820]   enjoying, are working longer again.
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.820]   So we're
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.820]   going to talk about some alternate ways, because
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.820]   from a financial planning perspective, this
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.820]   opens up a huge,
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.820]   huge, huge number of opportunities
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.820]   for us to kind of reinvent,
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.820]   basically reinvent the entire concept
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.820]   of working. If we can get free of
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.820]   this concept of work for my
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.820]   lifetime and then I have to retire at 65,
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.820]   if we can get free of this concept,
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.820]   then we can completely re-engineer our
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.820]   lives in some really
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.820]   awesome ways, and we can take control
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.820]   of it again. Over the
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.820]   years of working as a financial planner, I've
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.820]   asked hundreds of people
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.820]   this question. It's kind of part of my standard
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.820]   fact-finding process. And the question is
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   this: Is there a point in time at which you'd
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.820]   like to be in a position to not to have to work if you
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.820]   didn't want to? And kind of phrase it like that.
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.820]   To try to not be critical
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.820]   of, you know, do you want to retire? To try to
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.820]   kind of phrase it a little more elegantly.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.820]   Or, you know, is there a point that you'd just like to
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.820]   work because you choose to, not because you
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.820]   want to? And almost
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.820]   universally, I get one of three answers.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   There are exceptions.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.820]   The most common answer is,
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.820]   "Oh, yeah, definitely."
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.820]   And the follow-up question is, "Well, what age?
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.820]   When do you want to do that?"
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   "Uh, you know, 65." That's by far the most
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.820]   common answer. I'm going to make up some percentages
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.820]   on the spot here. I would say that's probably
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   50% of the time.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.820]   The second most common answer
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.820]   is, "No." Well, I mean,
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.820]   "Yeah, I'd like to have money, but no, I'm never going to quit."
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.820]   "You mean retire? I'm not going to quit."
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.820]   And that answer is probably the second most common.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.820]   I make up a number that's 30%.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.820]   Well, let's say
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:47.820]   20%. And then
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.820]   the third most common answer is, "Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.820]   At what age?" "You know, maybe a little bit early.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.820]   Like 60." And that's
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.820]   probably another 20%.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.820]   So if I got my statistic, if I made
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.820]   up my percentages appropriately, that's 90%.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.820]   The other 10% is various answers.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:03.820]   And I always push back
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.820]   and say, "Why? Why 65?"
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   "I don't know.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.820]   You know, that's
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:11.820]   a good age, right? That's the Social Security
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.820]   age. You know, that's when I can collect Social
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:15.820]   Security." And
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.820]   the thing I always, I just feel like is a big deal
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:19.820]   to push back on is, "Why are we choosing
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.820]   the age of 65?"
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:25.820]   "Why? Why not 66?
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.820]   Why not 64? Why not 44?
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.820]   Why not 94?" I don't
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.820]   care what you choose. But don't
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.820]   just choose the answer because that's the
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.820]   convenient answer. Don't just say, "I'm going to make
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.820]   this retirement plan." Because here's what happens.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.820]   I take that number and I go and create a written
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.820]   financial plan. And it shows that by the age of
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.820]   65, you need, you know, $1.4
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.820]   million. And I come back and I
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.820]   deliver the financial plan and I talk you through it. But
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.820]   the reality is, in order to accumulate the $1.4
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:51.820]   million, you've got to be saving
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.820]   $1,000 a month. And then we
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.820]   don't follow through and do the savings.
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.820]   So...
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   we've got to change that.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.820]   And we've got to create
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.820]   individualized plans that are
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.820]   really compelling. And so whether
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.820]   that's, "I'm going to take a year off
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.820]   every 10."
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   Whether that's, "I'm going to work and get
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.820]   early retirement."
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.820]   I don't know what the answer
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.820]   is. But there's
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.820]   lots of answers to it. I'll give you one
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.820]   of mine. This is me speaking
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.820]   personally. This whole "retire at 65"
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.820]   thing has never made sense to me.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.820]   And the reason it doesn't make sense to me,
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.820]   primarily, is because of my
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.820]   personal family values. So I look
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.820]   at it and I say, "Why on
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.820]   earth should I do this?"
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   So, go to school, Joshua. Graduate from high
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.820]   school. Go to college. Get a
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.820]   degree. Get out. Get a good job.
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.820]   Okay, I'm going to get a good job now. And now you need to
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   really work hard on your job. So you
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.820]   should also, however, get married when you're in your early
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.820]   20s and you should start a family.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.820]   So now that's the career building time and that's
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.820]   when you've got a family. You need to work really, really hard
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.820]   so you have a bunch of money saved up
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.820]   so that at the age of 65
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.820]   you can retire. So I work from
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.820]   let's say I got married and had kids
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.820]   at 25. So I work from 25 to
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   45 during those 20 most crucial years
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.820]   really building my career. I'm a workaholic
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:09.820]   always just slaving away at the
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.820]   office to allow me to save money. And I miss
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.820]   my kid's childhood.
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.820]   So I go to some soccer games from time to time and I
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.820]   get home at about 8 o'clock at night because I'm living
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.820]   on an airplane. But I miss my kid's childhood
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.820]   because I've got to build my career and I've got
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.820]   to save for retirement. So then about the age
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   of 45, I'm ready to pull back
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.820]   a little bit. But now I look down and my kids are 14
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.820]   years old. They don't want anything to do with me because
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   I wasn't there. And now they're 14 years old and they're trying
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.820]   to establish their independence.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.820]   And so here I am at the age of 45
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.820]   and now I'm senior enough in my company
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.820]   that I can afford to pull back a little
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.820]   bit of all my time. And so I
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.820]   do that. But the problem is they don't care much about me.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.820]   And then I keep working and I retire at 65
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.820]   right when my kids are
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.820]   25 years old and they're the ones that are working
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.820]   25 to
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.820]   45 years old and they're working to
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.820]   build their careers doing exactly what they watched me
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.820]   do. So I'm 65 so I can
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.820]   afford to sit around and do nothing. But my kids
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.820]   don't want anything to do with me so I have to go
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.820]   play nonstop.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.820]   It doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.820]   Why not just a very simple
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.820]   alternate plan? Why not simply
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:11.820]   say, "Okay, I'm going to graduate from
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.820]   college at 22 or whatever,
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   work really hard for a few years, save a
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   bunch of money, but then all during the time that my
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.820]   kids are growing up, why don't I pull back
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.820]   from the work? Why don't I pull
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.820]   back and spend time being present with them?"
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   And then once the kids are starting to
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.820]   establish their independence, they're 14 years
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.820]   old, why not at that point in time
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.820]   then really pour on the effort at work?
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.820]   And forget this whole 65 thing.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   Why not
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.820]   just simply build a lifestyle and a career
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.820]   that allows me to integrate fully my life
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.820]   and my work? If it's good enough for Mr. Marriott
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.820]   and Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates,
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.820]   why is it not good enough for the rest of us?
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.820]   Now, there are
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.820]   a lot of alternate plans. So I love the
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.820]   early retirement concept. The concept that
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.820]   for example, Money Mustache
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   -- hopefully we'll have him on the show at some point, I'd love to interview him --
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.820]   but Money Mustache talks about
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.820]   he and his wife's plan.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.820]   Their plan was to
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.820]   retire by the time they had kids.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.820]   So they did it at 31. That's awesome!
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.820]   How cool is that? That works.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.820]   And now they're home full-time raising their
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.820]   son. That's an awesome plan.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.820]   It's a lot smarter than
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.820]   doing it at 65.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.820]   So there are a number of
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.820]   there are a number of
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.820]   very -- of
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   different plans that we have. But once we get
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.820]   out of this age 65 thing,
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:27.820]   then we create a dramatically
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.820]   different financial planning
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.820]   options.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.820]   I'll read this article here, very short. But to me
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.820]   this is the constant. And over the
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.820]   next couple of decades it's going to get worse
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.820]   and worse and worse and worse
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.820]   as the government
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.820]   balances -- the government
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.820]   debt balances get worse and worse and worse.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.820]   Here's the constant refrain.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.820]   This is from the BBC News.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.820]   "Sinking of the Bismarck Legacy."
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.820]   Otto von Bismarck was the Prime Minister of Prussia
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.820]   before overseeing the unification of Germany.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.820]   The German Chancellor Otto von
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   Bismarck introduced the world's first state
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.820]   pension system in the 1880s.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.820]   You had to be 70 years old and the expectation
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.820]   was that you would probably only live
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.820]   a few years after
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.820]   that to collect it. But in
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.820]   1916 they lowered the pensionable age
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.820]   to age 65. It has
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.820]   remained at 65 for almost a century
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.820]   and it will take a brave government
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.820]   to juggle with the political
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.820]   sensitivity of raising that age again.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.820]   "It is a part of
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.820]   our political system and we pay for it.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.820]   The employees, the employers,
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.820]   and the state," says Wolfgang
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.820]   Wipperman at the Berlin Free University.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   "They have to continue with this.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.820]   Otherwise there will be a revolution
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   of the pensioners."
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.820]   Bleak future. But 9 out of 10 old people
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.820]   around the world do not have a pension.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   And for many of those lucky 1 in 10 who do,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:45.820]   these are worrying times.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.820]   Sinking portfolio values and
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.820]   demographic changes are forcing
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:51.820]   cash-strapped governments to consider
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.820]   fundamental reforms.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.820]   Bismarck designed the system
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.820]   in 1881 and it came into
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   force at the end of that decade in a very
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.820]   different world from the current one.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:03.820]   Old people are living longer than they were 50 years ago.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   Today there are four
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.820]   working Germans paying
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.820]   the pensions of every retired person.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.820]   But by the time today's youngest workers
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.820]   retire, there will be only two.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   You don't need to
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.820]   know anything more than that.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   The system is going to change.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.820]   So instead of having these whiny
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.820]   articles constantly
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.820]   about how we got to adjust things,
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   instead of us financial planners yelling at people saying,
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.820]   "You've got to save another percentage,"
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.820]   we need to find a new way
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   of tackling
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.820]   this problem.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.820]   The best way I know how to tackle it is
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.820]   with the concept of lifestyle design.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.820]   Lifestyle design, to the best
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.820]   of my knowledge, was
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.820]   popularized more recently by
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.820]   Tim Ferriss in his book
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.820]   "The 4-Hour Workweek."
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.820]   He designed it,
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:55.820]   which is a great idea.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.820]   But I would maintain that all people
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.820]   design their lifestyle.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.820]   Whether they do it intentionally,
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.820]   knowing the idea of lifestyle design or not,
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.820]   all people still design their lifestyle.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.820]   Why does one person choose
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.820]   to go to welding school,
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.820]   and why does another person choose
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.820]   to become a horse farrier?
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   One, I would assume, likes horses,
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:17.820]   and the other, I would assume, likes welders.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.820]   So that's designing a lifestyle.
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:21.820]   But the key is that we've got to apply
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.820]   this lifestyle design
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.820]   to every
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.820]   aspect of life.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.820]   Bill Gates has
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.820]   a lifestyle that I think is really,
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.820]   really neat. Not because of the private
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.820]   jet and the big house. To me,
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.820]   fine. Good for him.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.820]   To me, the fact that he gets to sit around and read books
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.820]   all day is my...
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.820]   To me, that's an idea. Read books
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.820]   and watch videos and
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.820]   talk to people and solve great problems.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.820]   In my mind, that's one of the world's
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.820]   greatest
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.820]   things you could do. That would be the most
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.820]   fun thing you can do.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.820]   That's why I'm creating a podcast.
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.820]   I'm creating a podcast
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.820]   that's about lifestyle design.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.820]   And any one of us can do it now
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.820]   if we integrate it.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.820]   So we've got to integrate the lifestyle design
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:09.820]   and the goal setting and figure out
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.820]   an individualized plan, which will be different
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.820]   for each one of us. One person may say,
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.820]   "I want to work until 65."
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.820]   Another person may say, "I want to quit at 45."
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.820]   Another person may say, "I never want to quit."
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.820]   It doesn't matter what your answer is
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.820]   as long as you know what it is.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.820]   I think that's enough for today.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.820]   A longer show today.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.820]   I plan to come back and continue on this
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.820]   retirement program.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.820]   We're going to continue with
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   I'm going to read at length from this book,
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   A History of Retirement, because it gives some
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.820]   background that is so crucial
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.820]   to understand the world today.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   I had to go and learn this from books because
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.820]   I wasn't around. But I've never heard anybody
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   reference this history.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   Once you reference this history and once you
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.820]   understand that retirement is not this
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.820]   end-all be-all of leisure,
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.820]   that this is a very new concept,
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:57.820]   it allows you to feel good about
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   making alternate plans.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.820]   I really believe that
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.820]   the idea of
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.820]   leisure being the goal,
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:07.820]   we see through that
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.820]   for the most part.
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.820]   We've all been on a vacation
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.820]   that's kind of like we're ready to be off
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.820]   a vacation when we're done with it.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.820]   That's something that I think
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.820]   we've all experienced.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.820]   However, there's so much
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   noise in the media.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.820]   There's so much noise in all of these
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820]   articles that come across Yahoo Finance,
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:29.820]   every day, and USA Today,
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.820]   you know, finance section,
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:33.820]   about how we're supposed to beat ourselves up
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.820]   for not saving for retirement.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.820]   It's okay to not save for retirement.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.820]   It's fine.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.820]   Let me be clear.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.820]   I save for retirement.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.820]   But the point is
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:47.820]   that just saving in a 401k
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.820]   on this arbitrary idea of
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.820]   I've got to save for retirement may not be the best way to do it.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   The best thing to do sometimes may be
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.820]   to cash out that 401k and go start
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.820]   the business. Warren Buffett did
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.820]   not become rich by saving in an IRA.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:01.820]   Conrad Hilton
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.820]   did not become rich by saving in an IRA.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.820]   We'll finish with this.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.820]   I just want to point this out.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.820]   One of my biggest frustrations
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:11.820]   with the financial media
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.820]   is that a lot of the advice
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.820]   just simply doesn't work.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.820]   It's lies.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.820]   It's not lies in the normal way
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   that lie is defined. It's not actually untrue.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.820]   It's that it just doesn't work.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.820]   The idea that
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.820]   well, you know,
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.820]   if you'll just save $200 a month
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.820]   into a Roth IRA,
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   you're going to be rich. Is that true?
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   Maybe.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:37.820]   There is no mathematical reason
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:39.820]   why that can't be true.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.820]   If you will save $200 a month
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.820]   If you will save $200 a month
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:49.820]   If you will save $200 a month
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.820]   If you will save $200 per month
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.820]   every month, let's say over
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.820]   a 40 year period of time
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:57.820]   40 years, and we do this
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.820]   let's just plug in 10% interest
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   and start with nothing
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.820]   Yes, at the end of 40 years
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.820]   you will have $1,264,815
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.820]   $1,264,815
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.820]   That is absolutely true.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.820]   And there's no reason why you can't
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.820]   do more than that. If you save $400
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.820]   a month
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.820]   at the end of 40 years, you will have
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.820]   $2,500,000. So $400 a month
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.820]   over a 40 year career is $2.5 million
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.820]   which considering
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.820]   what was that statistic that I read
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.820]   29% of retirees
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:29.820]   have less than $1,000 and only
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:31.820]   11% have more than $250,000
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   that will put you there.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.820]   So I was mistaken.
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.820]   So current retirees
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:39.820]   17% have $250,000
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   or more. So yes, $400
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.820]   a month into a Roth IRA
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.820]   will in fact, under my
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:47.820]   10% number, will indeed get you there
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.820]   let's plug in 8%
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   and 8% you're at $1,400,000
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:53.820]   So you're in that top
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   top echelon
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.820]   of retirees with money
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.820]   but look at
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.820]   look at the people that are in
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.820]   the Forbes 400. None of them ever got there
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.820]   by saving for retirement
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.820]   and look at the fact that
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.820]   in an IRA, look at the fact that only
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.820]   17% of retirees have
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.820]   more than a quarter million dollars
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820]   So what about the rest of them?
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.820]   What's wrong with taking that and starting a business?
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.820]   What's wrong with taking that and investing in other ways?
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.820]   This is not a
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.820]   I love Roth IRAs. I think they're one of the most
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:25.820]   incredibly flexible
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.820]   accounts but
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.820]   it's not the end all be all
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.820]   It's okay to do other things with the money
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:33.820]   So we'll talk about that
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.820]   We'll talk about that on another day
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.820]   Hopefully today has been interesting
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.820]   I really appreciate you listening
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.820]   To close out here, just a couple of
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.820]   comments. I'm going to say this once and I'm going to
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.820]   try not to
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.820]   apologize a lot in the future about this stuff
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.820]   I don't expect my
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.820]   A lot of times, podcasts are expected
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.820]   to be short. I'm here at
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.820]   an hour and a half. I don't have any
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.820]   predicted time for the show
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.820]   whether that's 20 minutes or 1 hour and
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.820]   45 minutes. If you're bored with what we're
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:03.820]   talking about, just feel free, just turn it right off
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.820]   That won't bother me a bit if you turn the show off
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.820]   If there's something you want to completely
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.820]   skip, skip. Pick and choose what you
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.820]   find interesting. I do my best
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   to try to present things in a way that
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   I think are interesting but it won't bother
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.820]   me a bit if you just shut it off and
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.820]   move on.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   Love to hear your comments on today's

[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.820]   which is my opinions. I screw stuff
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.820]   up. I would love to know about it.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.820]   If you found something I screwed up, come by

[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.820]   Financial planning is very
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:09.820]   personal and it's very state and
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.820]   country specific. Please
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   call a professional for their opinion on
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.820]   your situation and don't
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.820]   rely on the advice of a random guy
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.820]   on the internet for any major decision.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.820]   Have a great day.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:23.820]   Thank you.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:27.820]   Thank you.

[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:27.780]   Thank you.
