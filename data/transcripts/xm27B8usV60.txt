[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   GitHub was bought by Microsoft about four years ago.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720]   probabilistically acquisitions usually don't work.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   And especially Microsoft acquisitions often don't work.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.960]   GitHub at the time was on this decline.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   They hadn't shipped anything for many years.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.920]   They had a bunch of different competition.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   So Nat, who had sold Zimian to Microsoft was appointed a CEO by Satya at the time.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.160]   And he really revitalized and energized GitHub.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.800]   And he just wound up leaving a few months ago.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.840]   GitHub is the forefront of innovation.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.400]   Between GitHub and VS Code, Microsoft dominates the developer landscape.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.160]   GitHub Copilot is maybe, when people ask me, "Hey, do you have an example of AI
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.400]   actually working at scale?"
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.280]   There's a non-trivial percentage of code in GitHub being generated by Copilot.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280]   And it all comes to Nat.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.440]   He did so many things really well.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.320]   Came in, really focused on shipping very quickly, listening to the community, was
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.120]   out in front whenever there was a controversy.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.200]   And the odds were against him.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.440]   If I was a betting person in 2018, '19, I would have said, "Nat is going to fail."
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.400]   He succeeded.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.520]   He left GitHub a lot better than he found it.
