[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   On one axis, you have more hardware coming in.
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.960]   On the other hand, you have an explosion of innovation in AI.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.080]   And so what happened with both TensorFlow and PyTorch is that the explosion of innovation in AI has led to,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.420]   it's not just about matrix multiplication and convolution.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.200]   These things have now like 2,000 different operators.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.260]   And on the other hand, you have, I don't know how many pieces of hardware there are out there.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.860]   It's a lot.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.640]   Part of my thesis, part of my belief of where computing goes, if you look out 10 years from now,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.320]   is it's not going to get simpler.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200]   Physics isn't going back to where we came from.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.580]   It's only going to get weirder from here on out.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.940]   And so to me, the exciting part about what we're building is it's about building that universal platform,
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.160]   which the world can continue to get weird, because again, I don't think it's avoidable.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.720]   It's physics.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.360]   But we can help lift people, scale, do things with it.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600]   And they don't have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.220]   And I think that's pretty cool.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.960]   The following is a conversation with Chris Ladner,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.020]   his third time on this podcast.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.280]   As I've said many times before,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.380]   he's one of the most brilliant engineers in modern computing,
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.660]   having created LLM Compiler Infrastructure Project,
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.500]   the Clang Compiler, the Swift Programming Language,
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.300]   a lot of key contributions to TensorFlow and TPUs as part of Google.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.040]   He served as vice president of autopilot software at Tesla,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.760]   was a software innovator and leader at Apple,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   and now he co-created a new full-stack AI infrastructure,
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.480]   for distributed training, inference and deployment
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.480]   on all kinds of hardware called modular,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.280]   and a new programming language called Mojo.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   That is a super set of Python,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   giving you all the usability of Python,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   but with the performance of C/C++.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   In many cases, Mojo code has demonstrated over 30,000x speedup over Python.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   If you love machine learning, if you love Python,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.180]   you should definitely give Mojo a try.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.700]   The next thing I want to talk about is the technology.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.800]   The technology is the most advanced technology in the world.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.900]   The technology is the most advanced technology in the world.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.400]   This programming language, this new AI framework and infrastructure,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   and this conversation with Chris is mind-blowing.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   I love it.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   It gets pretty technical at times, so I hope you hang on for the ride.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   And now, dear friends, here's Chris Ladner.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.900]   It's been, I think, two years since we last talked,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.620]   and in that time, you somehow went and co-created a new podcast.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.

[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:02.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:04.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:08.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:10.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:12.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:14.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:18.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:22.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:24.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:26.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:28.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:32.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:36.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:38.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:40.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:42.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:44.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:46.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:50.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:52.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:54.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:58.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:00.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:02.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:04.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:06.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:08.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:10.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:12.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:14.620]   And I think you're going to be able to hear it.
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:18.620]   So this kind of self-building loop is interesting to understand
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.620]   So this kind of self-building loop is interesting to understand
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.620]   because when you look at Mojo, what it stands for,
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:24.620]   because when you look at Mojo, what it stands for,
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:26.620]   some of the features, it seems sort of clear that this is a good direction
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:28.620]   some of the features, it seems sort of clear that this is a good direction
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:30.620]   for programming languages to evolve in the machine learning community.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:32.620]   for programming languages to evolve in the machine learning community.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:34.620]   But it's still not obvious that it will,
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.620]   because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality.
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:38.620]   because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:40.620]   because of this, whatever the engine of popularity, of virality.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.620]   Is there something you could speak to?
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:44.620]   Like how do you get people to start to understand Mojo?
[02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:46.620]   Like how do you get people to start to understand Mojo?
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:48.620]   Yeah, well I mean, I think that the viral growth loop
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:50.620]   is to switch people to Unicode.
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:52.620]   I think the Unicode file extensions are what I'm betting on.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.620]   I think that's going to be the thing.
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:56.620]   Tell the kids that you can use the fire emoji
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:58.620]   Tell the kids that you can use the fire emoji
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:00.620]   and they'd be like, "What?"
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:02.620]   Well, in all seriousness,
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:04.620]   I think there's really,
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:06.620]   I'll give you two opposite answers.
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.620]   One is,
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.620]   I hope if it's useful, if it solves problems,
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:12.620]   and if people care about those problems being solved,
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:14.620]   they'll adopt the technology.
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:16.620]   That's kind of the simple answer.
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:18.620]   That's kind of the simple answer.
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:20.620]   When you're looking to get tech adopted,
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.620]   the question is, is it solving an important problem
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:24.620]   people need solved?
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.620]   And is the adoption cost low enough
[02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:28.620]   that they're willing to make the switch
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:30.620]   and cut over
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:32.620]   and do the pain up front
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.620]   so that they can actually do it?
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.620]   And so hopefully Mojo will be that
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.620]   for a bunch of people.
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.620]   And people building these hybrid packages are suffering.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.620]   It's really painful.
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:44.620]   And so I think that we have a good shot of helping people.
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:46.620]   But the other side is,
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:48.620]   it's okay if people don't use Mojo.
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:50.620]   It's not my job to say,
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:52.620]   "Everybody should do this."
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.620]   I'm not saying Python is bad.
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:56.620]   I hope Cpython, all these implementations,
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:58.620]   because the Python ecosystem is not just Cpython,
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.620]   it's also a bunch of different implementations
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:02.620]   with different trade-offs.
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:04.620]   And this ecosystem is really powerful and exciting,
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:06.620]   as are other programming languages.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.620]   It's not like TypeScript or something
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.620]   is going to go away.
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.620]   There's not a winner-take-all thing.
[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:14.620]   And so I hope that Mojo is exciting and useful to people,
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:16.620]   and if it's not, that's also fine.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:18.620]   But I also wonder what the
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:20.620]   use case
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:22.620]   for why you should try Mojo would be.
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:24.620]   So practically speaking,
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:26.620]   it seems like
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:28.620]   there's entertainment,
[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:30.620]   there's the dopamine hit
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.620]   of saying, "Holy shit,
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:34.620]   this is ten times faster."
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:36.620]   This little piece of code is ten times faster
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:38.620]   in Mojo.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:40.620]   Out of the box before you get to 35,000.
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:42.620]   Exactly.
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:44.620]   I mean, that's the dopamine hit
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:46.620]   that every programmer sort of dreams of,
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:48.620]   is the optimization.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.620]   It's also the drug
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:52.620]   that can pull you in
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:54.620]   and have you waste
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:56.620]   way too much of your life
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.620]   optimizing and over-optimizing.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:00.620]   But so what
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:02.620]   do you see would be like
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:04.620]   commonly?
[02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:06.620]   It's very hard to predict, of course,
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:08.620]   but if you look 10 years from now
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:10.620]   and Mojo's super successful,
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:12.620]   what do you think would be the thing
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.620]   where people try it
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:16.620]   and then use it regularly
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.620]   and it kind of grows and grows and grows?
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:20.620]   Well, so you talk about dopamine hit.
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:22.620]   Again, humans are not
[02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.620]   one thing.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.620]   Some people love rewriting
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:28.620]   their code and learning new things and throwing themselves
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:30.620]   in the deep end and trying out a new thing.
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:32.620]   In my experience, most people don't.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:34.620]   Like, they're too busy.
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:36.620]   They have other things going on.
[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:38.620]   By number, most people don't
[02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:40.620]   like this, "I want to rewrite all my code."
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:42.620]   But
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:44.620]   even those people
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:46.620]   the too busy people, the people that
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:48.620]   don't actually care about the language
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:50.620]   or just care about getting stuff done,
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:52.620]   those people do like learning new things.
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:54.620]   Right? And so you talk about
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:56.620]   the dopamine rush of 10x faster.
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:58.620]   "Wow, that's cool. I want to do that again."
[02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:00.620]   Well, it's also like, "Here's a thing I've heard about
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:02.620]   in a different domain, and now I don't have to rewrite
[02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:04.620]   all my code. I can learn a new trick."
[02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:06.620]   Right? Well, that's called growth.
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:08.620]   You know? And so
[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:10.620]   one thing that I think is cool about Mojo
[02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:12.620]   and, again, this will take a little bit of time
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.620]   for, for example, the blog
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:16.620]   posts and the books and all that kind of stuff
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:18.620]   to develop and the language needs to get further along,
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:20.620]   but what we're doing, you talk
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.620]   about types, you can say, "Look, you can
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:24.620]   start with the world you already know,
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:26.620]   and you can progressively learn new things
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:28.620]   and adopt them where it makes sense."
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:30.620]   If you never do that,
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:32.620]   that's cool. You're not a bad person.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:34.620]   If you get really excited
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.620]   about it and want to go all the way in the deep end and
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:38.620]   rewrite everything and whatever, that's cool.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:40.620]   Right? But I think the middle path
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:42.620]   is actually the more likely one, where
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:44.620]   it's, you know, you come out with
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.620]   a new idea and you
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:48.620]   discover, "Wow, that makes my code way simpler,
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:50.620]   way more beautiful, way faster, way whatever."
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:52.620]   And I think that's what people like.
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:54.620]   Now, if you fast forward
[02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:56.620]   and you said, like, 10 years out,
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:58.620]   right? I can give you
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.620]   a very different answer on that, which is, I mean,
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:02.620]   if you go back and look at what
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:04.620]   computers looked like 20 years ago,
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:06.620]   every 18 months they got faster
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:08.620]   for free.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:10.620]   Right? 2x faster every 18 months,
[02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:12.620]   it was like clockwork. It was free, right?
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:14.620]   You go back 10 years ago,
[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:16.620]   and we entered in this world where suddenly
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:18.620]   we had multi-core CPUs and we had GPUs.
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:20.620]   And if you
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:22.620]   squint and turn your head, what a GPU is,
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:24.620]   it's just a mini-core,
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:26.620]   very simple CPU thing, kind of, right?
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:28.620]   And so,
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:30.620]   10 years ago, it was CPUs and GPUs
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.620]   and graphics.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.620]   Today,
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:36.620]   we have CPUs, GPUs,
[02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:38.620]   graphics,
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:40.620]   and AI. Because it's so important,
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:42.620]   because the compute is so demanding, because
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:44.620]   of the smart cameras and the watches and the
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.620]   all the different places that AI needs to
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:48.620]   work in our lives,
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:50.620]   it's caused this explosion of hardware.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:52.620]   And so, part of my thesis, part of my
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.620]   belief of where computing goes, if you look
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:56.620]   out 10 years from now, is it's not
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:58.620]   going to get simpler.
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:00.620]   Physics isn't going back to where we came from,
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:02.620]   it's only going to get weirder from here on out.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.620]   Right? And so, to me,
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.620]   the exciting part about what we're building
[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:08.620]   is it's about building that
[02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.620]   universal platform, which
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:12.620]   the world can continue to get weird,
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:14.620]   because again, I don't think it's avoidable, it's physics,
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:16.620]   but we can help
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:18.620]   lift people, scale, do things with it, and they don't have
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:20.620]   to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:22.620]   And I think that's pretty cool.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.620]   And so, if Mojo can help with that problem,
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:26.620]   then I think that it will be hopefully quite
[02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:28.620]   interesting and quite useful to a wide range of people,
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:30.620]   because there's so much potential
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:32.620]   and like there's so much, you know, maybe
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.620]   analog computers will become a thing
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:36.620]   or something, right? And we need to be able to get into
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:38.620]   a mode where we can move
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:40.620]   this programming model forward, but do so in a way
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.620]   where we're lifting people and
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:44.620]   growing them, instead of
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.620]   forcing them to rewrite all their code and exploding them.
[02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:48.620]   Do you think there'll be a few major
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:50.620]   libraries that go Mojo first?
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:54.620]   Well, so I mean,
[02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:56.620]   the modular engine's all Mojo.
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:58.620]   So, again, come back to, like,
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:00.620]   we're not building Mojo because it's fun, we're building Mojo
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:02.620]   because we had to to solve these accelerators.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:04.620]   That's the origin story. But I mean ones that are
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.620]   currently in Python. Yeah, so I think that
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:08.620]   a number of these projects will. And so one of the things,
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:10.620]   again, this is just my best guess, like,
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:12.620]   each of the package maintainers also has,
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:14.620]   I'm sure, plenty of other things going on.
[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:16.620]   People don't, like, really don't like rewriting code
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:18.620]   just for the sake of rewriting code.
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.620]   But sometimes, like,
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:22.620]   people are excited about, like,
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:24.620]   adopting a new idea.
[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:26.620]   It turns out that while rewriting code is
[02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.620]   generally not people's first
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:30.620]   thing, it turns out that
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.620]   redesigning something while you rewrite
[02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:34.620]   it and using a rewrite as an excuse to
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:36.620]   redesign can lead to
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:38.620]   the 2.0 of your thing that's
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:40.620]   way better than the 1.0.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:42.620]   And so, I have no idea.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:44.620]   I can't predict that. But there's a lot of these
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:46.620]   places where, again, if you have a
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:48.620]   package that is half C and half Python,
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.620]   right, you just
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:52.620]   solve the pain, make it easier to move things faster,
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:54.620]   make it easier to debug and evolve your
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:56.620]   tech, adopting Mojo
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:58.620]   kind of makes sense to start with. And then it gives you this
[02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:00.620]   opportunity to rethink these things.
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:02.620]   So the two big gains are that there's
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:04.620]   a performance gain,
[02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:06.620]   and then there's
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:08.620]   the portability
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:10.620]   to all kinds of different devices.
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.620]   And there's safety, right? So you talk about real types.
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:14.620]   I mean,
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:16.620]   not saying this is for everybody, but that's
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:18.620]   actually a pretty big thing.
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:20.620]   And so there's a bunch of different
[02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:22.620]   aspects of what value Mojo provides.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.620]   And so, I mean, it's funny for me. Like, I've
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:26.620]   been working on these kinds of
[02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:28.620]   technologies and tools for
[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:30.620]   too many years now.
[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:32.620]   But you look at Swift, right? And we talked about
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:34.620]   Swift for TensorFlow, but Swift as a programming
[02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:36.620]   language, right?
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:38.620]   Swift's now 13
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.620]   years old from when
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:42.620]   I started it. Because I started
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:44.620]   in 2010, if I remember.
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:46.620]   And so, that
[02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:48.620]   project, and I was involved with it for
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:50.620]   12 years or something, right? That
[02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:52.620]   project has gone through its own really interesting
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:54.620]   story arc, right? And it's a mature,
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:56.620]   successful, used by millions of people system,
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:58.620]   right? Certainly not dead
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.620]   yet, right? But also,
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.620]   going through that story arc, I learned a tremendous
[02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:04.620]   amount about building languages, about building
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:06.620]   compilers, about working with community,
[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:08.620]   and things like this. And so, that
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:10.620]   experience, like I'm helping channel and
[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:12.620]   bring directly into Mojo. And
[02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:14.620]   other systems, same thing. Like, apparently, I
[02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:16.620]   like building and iterating
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:18.620]   and evolving things. And so, you look at this LLVM
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:20.620]   thing I worked on 20 years ago,
[02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:22.620]   and you look at MLIR, right?
[02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:24.620]   And so, a lot of the lessons learned in LLVM
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.620]   got fed into MLIR. And I
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:28.620]   think that MLIR is a way better system than
[02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.620]   LLVM was. And, you know,
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:32.620]   Swift is a really good system, and it's
[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:34.620]   amazing. But I hope that Mojo
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:36.620]   will take the next step
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:38.620]   forward in terms of
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:40.620]   design.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:42.620]   In terms of running Mojo,
[02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:44.620]   people can play with it. What's Mojo play?
[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:46.620]   It's a playground.
[02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:48.620]   And from the interface perspective,
[02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:50.620]   and from the hardware perspective,
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:52.620]   what's this
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:54.620]   incredible thing running on?
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.620]   Yeah, so right now, so here we are
[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:58.620]   two weeks after launch. We decided
[02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:00.620]   that, okay, we have this incredible
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:02.620]   set of technology that
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:04.620]   we think might be good, but we have not given it to
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:06.620]   lots of people yet.
[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:08.620]   And so we were very conservative and said,
[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:10.620]   let's put it in a workbook so that if it crashes
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:12.620]   we can do something about it. We can monitor
[02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:14.620]   and track that, right? And so,
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:16.620]   again, things are still super early,
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.620]   but we're having, like, one person
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:20.620]   a minute sign up
[02:21:20.620 --> 02:21:22.620]   with over 70,000
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.620]   people two weeks in.
[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:26.620]   It's kind of crazy.
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:28.620]   So you can sign up to Mojo Playground and you can
[02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:30.620]   use it in the cloud.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:32.620]   Yeah. In your browser.
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:34.620]   And so what that's running on, right? Yeah, what that's running on
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:36.620]   is that's running on cloud
[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:38.620]   VMs. And so you share
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:40.620]   a machine with a bunch of other people, but
[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:42.620]   it turns out there's a bunch of them now because there's
[02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:44.620]   a lot of people. And so,
[02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:46.620]   what you're doing is you're getting free compute and you're getting
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:48.620]   to play with this thing in kind of a limited,
[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:50.620]   controlled way so that we can make sure
[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:52.620]   that it doesn't totally crash
[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:54.620]   and be embarrassing.
[02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:56.620]   So, now a lot of
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:58.620]   the feedback we've gotten is people want to download it locally,
[02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:00.620]   so we're working on that right now.
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:02.620]   So that's the goal, to be able to download it locally?
[02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:04.620]   Yeah, that's what everybody expects.
[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:06.620]   And so we're working on that right now. And so we just want
[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:08.620]   to make sure that we do it right.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.620]   I think this is one of the lessons I learned from Swift
[02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:12.620]   also, by the way,
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:14.620]   is that when we launched Swift,
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:16.620]   gosh, it feels like forever ago, it was 2014,
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:18.620]   and we,
[02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:20.620]   I mean, it was super exciting.
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:22.620]   I and we, the team, had worked on
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:24.620]   Swift for a number of years in secrecy.
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:26.620]   And
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:28.620]   we, four years into
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:30.620]   this development, roughly, of working on
[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:32.620]   this thing, at that point about
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:34.620]   250 people at Apple knew about it.
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.620]   So it was secret.
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:38.620]   Apple's good at secrecy, and it was a secret project.
[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:40.620]   And so we launched this at
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.620]   WWDC, a bunch of hoopla and excitement,
[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.620]   and said, "Developers, you're going to be
[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:46.620]   able to develop and submit apps to the App Store
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:48.620]   in three months."
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:50.620]   Well, several interesting
[02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:52.620]   things happened, right? So first of all, we learned
[02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:54.620]   that, A, it had a lot of bugs.
[02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:56.620]   And it was not
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:58.620]   actually production quality. And it was
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:00.620]   extremely stressful in terms of
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:02.620]   trying to get it working
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:04.620]   for a bunch of people. And so what happened was
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:06.620]   we went from zero to, you know,
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.620]   I don't know how many developers Apple had at the time,
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:10.620]   but a lot of developers overnight.
[02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:12.620]   And they ran into a lot of bugs,
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.620]   and it was really embarrassing, and it was
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:16.620]   very stressful for everybody involved.
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:18.620]   It was also very exciting, because everybody was
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.620]   excited about that. The other thing I learned
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:22.620]   is that when that happened, roughly
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:24.620]   every software engineer who did not know about the project
[02:23:24.620 --> 02:23:26.620]   at Apple, their head exploded when
[02:23:26.620 --> 02:23:28.620]   it was launched, because they didn't know it was
[02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:30.620]   coming. And so they're like, "Wait,
[02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:32.620]   what is this? I signed up to work for Apple because
[02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:34.620]   I love Objective-C. Why is there a new thing?"
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:36.620]   And so
[02:23:36.620 --> 02:23:38.620]   now what that meant, practically,
[02:23:38.620 --> 02:23:40.620]   is that the push
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:42.620]   from launch to, first of all,
[02:23:42.620 --> 02:23:44.620]   the fall, but then to 2.0 and 3.0
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:46.620]   and like all the way forward,
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:48.620]   was super
[02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:50.620]   painful for the engineering team
[02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:52.620]   and myself. It was very stressful.
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:54.620]   The developer community was very grumpy
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:56.620]   about it, because they're like, "Okay, well, wait a second.
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:58.620]   You're changing and breaking my code, and like
[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:00.620]   we have to fix the bugs." And it was
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:02.620]   just like a lot of tension and friction
[02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:04.620]   on all sides.
[02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:06.620]   There's a lot of technical debt in the
[02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:08.620]   compiler, because we have to
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.620]   run really fast, and you have to go implement the thing and unblock
[02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:12.620]   the use case and do the thing, and you know
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:14.620]   it's not right, but you never have time to go back and do it
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:16.620]   right. And I'm very
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:18.620]   proud of the Swift team, because they've come
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:20.620]   I mean, we, but
[02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:22.620]   they came so far
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.620]   and made so much progress over
[02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:26.620]   this time since launch. It's
[02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:28.620]   pretty incredible, and Swift is a very, very good thing.
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:30.620]   But I just don't want to do that again.
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:32.620]   Right? And so... So,
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:34.620]   iterate more through the
[02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:36.620]   development process. Yeah. And so what we're doing is
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:38.620]   we're not launching it when it's hopefully
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:40.620]   0.9 with no testers.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:42.620]   We're launching it and saying it's 0.1.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.620]   Right? And so we're setting expectations
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:46.620]   and saying like, okay, well, don't use this for
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:48.620]   production. Right? If you're
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:50.620]   interested in what we're doing, we'll do it in an open
[02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:52.620]   way, and we can do it together,
[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:54.620]   but don't use it in production yet.
[02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:56.620]   Like, we'll get there, but let's do it
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:58.620]   the right way. And I'm also saying
[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:00.620]   we're not in a race.
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:02.620]   The thing that I want to do
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:04.620]   is build the world's best thing. Yeah.
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:06.620]   Right? Because if you do it right
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:08.620]   and it lifts the industry, it doesn't matter
[02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:10.620]   if it takes an extra two months. Yeah.
[02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:12.620]   Like, two months is worth waiting. And so
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:14.620]   doing it right and not being
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:16.620]   overwhelmed with technical debt and things like
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:18.620]   this is like, again,
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:20.620]   war wounds, lessons learned,
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:22.620]   whatever you want to say, I think
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:24.620]   is absolutely the right thing to do, even though
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:26.620]   right now people are very frustrated that, you know,
[02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.620]   you can't download it or it doesn't have feature
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:30.620]   X or something like this.
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:32.620]   What have you learned in
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:34.620]   a little bit of time since it's
[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:36.620]   been released
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:38.620]   into the wild that people
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.620]   have been complaining about feature X
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:42.620]   or Y or Z? What have they been
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:44.620]   complaining about? What they have been
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:46.620]   excited about, like,
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:48.620]   almost like detailed things versus
[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:50.620]   big vision. I think everyone
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:52.620]   would be very excited about the big vision.
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:54.620]   Yeah, yeah. Well, so, I mean, I've been very pleased.
[02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:56.620]   In fact, I mean, we've been massively
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.620]   overwhelmed with response, which is
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:00.620]   a good problem to have.
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:02.620]   It's kind of like a success disaster
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.620]   in a sense, right?
[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:06.620]   And so,
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:08.620]   I mean, if you go back in time, when we started
[02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:10.620]   Modular, which was just not yet
[02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:12.620]   a year and a half ago, so it's still
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:14.620]   a pretty new company, new team,
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:16.620]   small but very good team
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:18.620]   of people. Like, we started with
[02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:20.620]   extreme conviction that there's
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.620]   a set of problems that we need to solve, and if we
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:24.620]   solve it, then people will be interested in
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.620]   what we're doing, right? But
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:28.620]   again, you're building in basically secret,
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.620]   right? You're trying to figure
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:32.620]   it out. Creation's a messy
[02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:34.620]   process. You're having to go through different paths
[02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:36.620]   and understand what you want to do and how
[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:38.620]   to explain it. Often when you're doing disruptive
[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:40.620]   and new kinds of things,
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.620]   just knowing how to explain it is super
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:44.620]   difficult, right? And
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.620]   so, when we launched, we hoped
[02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:48.620]   people would be excited, but
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:50.620]   you know, I'm an optimist, but I'm
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:52.620]   also, like, don't want to get ahead
[02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:54.620]   of myself. And so, when people
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:56.620]   found out about Mojo, I think their heads exploded
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:58.620]   a little bit.
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:00.620]   And, you know, here's, I think, a
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.620]   pretty credible team that has built some languages and
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.620]   some tools before, and so they have some
[02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:06.620]   lessons learned and are tackling
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.620]   some of the deep problems in the Python
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.620]   ecosystem and giving it the love
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:12.620]   and attention that it should be getting. And I think
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:14.620]   people got very excited about that. And so, if you
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:16.620]   look at that, I mean, I think people are excited about
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:18.620]   ownership and taking a step beyond
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:20.620]   Rust, right? And there's people that are very excited about
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:22.620]   that. And there's people that are excited about,
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:24.620]   you know, just, like, I made
[02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:26.620]   Game of Life go 400 times faster.
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:28.620]   Right? And things like that.
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:30.620]   And that's really cool. There are people that are really
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:32.620]   excited about the, "Okay, I really hate writing
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:34.620]   stuff in C++. Save me."
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:36.620]   Like, systems in your, they're, like, stepping up, like,
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:38.620]   "Oh, yes." Yeah, yeah. So, that's
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.620]   me, by the way. Also,
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:42.620]   I really want to stop
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:44.620]   writing C++. But the
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:46.620]   I get third-person
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:48.620]   excitement when people tweet
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:50.620]   "Here, I made this code, Game
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:52.620]   of Life," or whatever, faster.
[02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:54.620]   And you're like, "Yeah." Yeah, and
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:56.620]   also, like, I
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:27:58.620]   would also say that, let me
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:00.620]   cast blame out to people
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:02.620]   who deserve it. Sure.
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:04.620]   These terrible people who convinced
[02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:06.620]   me to do some of this. Yes.
[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:08.620]   Jeremy Howard. Yes. That guy.
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:10.620]   Well, he's been pushing for
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:12.620]   this kind of thing. He's been pushing for a long time. He's wanted this for years!
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.620]   Yeah, he's wanted this for a long, long time.
[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:16.620]   He's wanted this for years! For people who don't know
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:18.620]   Jeremy Howard, he's, like, one of the most
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:20.620]   legit people in the machine learning community.
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:22.620]   He's, uh, he's at grassroots.
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:24.620]   He really teaches.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:26.620]   He's an incredible educator. He's an incredible
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:28.620]   teacher, but also legit, in terms
[02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:30.620]   of a machine learning engineer himself.
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:32.620]   Yeah, so... And he's been running the Fast.ai
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:34.620]   and looking, I think,
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:36.620]   for exactly what you've done.
[02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:38.620]   Exactly. And so,
[02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:40.620]   I mean, the first time...
[02:28:40.620 --> 02:28:42.620]   So, I met Jeremy pretty early on.
[02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:44.620]   But the first time I sat up
[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:46.620]   and I'm like, "This guy
[02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:48.620]   is ridiculous," is when I was
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:50.620]   at Google, and we were bringing up TPUs,
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:52.620]   and we had a whole team of people,
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:54.620]   and we're... There was this
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:56.620]   competition called "Dawn Bench,"
[02:28:56.620 --> 02:28:58.620]   of who can train
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:00.620]   ImageNet fastest.
[02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:02.620]   Right? Yes. And Jeremy and
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.620]   one of his researchers
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:06.620]   crushed Google.
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:08.620]   Not through sheer force of the amazing
[02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:10.620]   amount of compute and the number of TPUs and stuff
[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:12.620]   like that. He just
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:14.620]   decided that progressive imagery sizing
[02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:16.620]   was the right way to train the model in
[02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:18.620]   fewer epochs faster and make
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:20.620]   the whole thing go vroom, right?
[02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:22.620]   And I'm like, "This guy
[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.620]   is incredible." And so you can say...
[02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:26.620]   Anyways, come back to
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:28.620]   where's Mojo coming from.
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.620]   Chris finally listened to Jeremy.
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:32.620]   It's all his fault.
[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:34.620]   Well, there's a kind of very
[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:36.620]   refreshing,
[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:38.620]   pragmatic view
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:40.620]   that he has about machine learning
[02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:42.620]   that,
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.620]   I don't know if... It's like this
[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:46.620]   mix of
[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:48.620]   a desire for efficiency, but ultimately
[02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:50.620]   grounded in a desire to make
[02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:52.620]   machine learning more accessible
[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:54.620]   to a lot of people. I don't know what that is.
[02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:56.620]   I guess that's coupled with efficiency
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.620]   and performance, but it's
[02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:00.620]   not just obsessed about performance.
[02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:02.620]   So a lot of AI and AI
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:04.620]   research ends up being that it
[02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:06.620]   has to go fast enough to get scale.
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.620]   So a lot of people don't actually care
[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:10.620]   about performance, particularly on the research side,
[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:12.620]   until it allows them to have more... A bigger data
[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.620]   set.
[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:16.620]   So suddenly now you care about distributed
[02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:18.620]   compute and all these exotic HPC...
[02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:20.620]   You don't actually want to know about that. You just want
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:22.620]   to be able to do more experiments
[02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:24.620]   faster and do so with bigger data sets.
[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.620]   And so Jeremy has been
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:28.620]   really pushing the limits. And one of the things I'll say
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:30.620]   about Jeremy, and there's many things
[02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:32.620]   I could say about Jeremy because I'm a fanboy of his,
[02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:34.620]   but he
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:36.620]   fits in his head.
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:38.620]   And Jeremy actually takes the time, where many
[02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:40.620]   people don't, to really dive
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:42.620]   deep into why is the
[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:44.620]   beta parameter of the atom optimizer equal
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:46.620]   to this. And he'll
[02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:48.620]   go survey and understand
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.620]   what are all the activation functions
[02:30:50.620 --> 02:30:52.620]   and the trade-offs and why is it that everybody that does
[02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:54.620]   this model
[02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:56.620]   pick that thing.
[02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:58.620]   So the why, not just trying different values,
[02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:00.620]   like really what is going on here.
[02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:02.620]   And so as a consequence of that,
[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:04.620]   he's always, again, he makes
[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.620]   time, but he spends time
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.620]   to understand things at a depth that a lot of
[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:10.620]   people don't. And as you say,
[02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:12.620]   he then brings it and teaches people
[02:31:12.620 --> 02:31:14.620]   how to do it. And his mission
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:16.620]   is to help lift, you know, his website
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:18.620]   says, "Making AI Uncool Again."
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:20.620]   Like, it's about, like, forget about the hype,
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:22.620]   it's actually practical and useful.
[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:24.620]   Let's teach people how to do this, right?
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:26.620]   Now the problem Jeremy struggled with is that
[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:28.620]   he's pushing the envelope.
[02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:30.620]   Research isn't about doing the thing that is
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:32.620]   staying on the happy path, or the well-paved
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:34.620]   road, right? And so
[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:36.620]   a lot of the systems today have been
[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.620]   these really fragile, fragmented things
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:40.620]   or special case in this happy path. And if you
[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:42.620]   fall off the happy path, you get
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:44.620]   eaten by an alligator.
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:46.620]   So
[02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:48.620]   what about,
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:50.620]   so Python has this giant
[02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.620]   ecosystem of packages
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.620]   and there's a package repository.
[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:56.620]   Do you have ideas of how to do that well
[02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:58.620]   for Mojo?
[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:00.620]   How to do a repository of packages?
[02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:02.620]   Well, so that's another really interesting problem
[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:04.620]   that I knew about, but I didn't
[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:06.620]   understand how big of a problem it was.
[02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:08.620]   Python packaging,
[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:10.620]   a lot of people have very big pain
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:12.620]   points and a lot of scars with Python packaging.
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:14.620]   Oh, you mean, so there's several things to say.
[02:32:14.620 --> 02:32:16.620]   Building and distributing and managing
[02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:18.620]   dependencies and versioning
[02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:20.620]   and all this stuff.
[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:22.620]   So from the perspective of if you want to create your own
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:24.620]   package. Yes. And then, or you want to
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:26.620]   build on top of a bunch of other people's packages
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:28.620]   and then they get updated and things like this.
[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:30.620]   Now, I'm not an expert in this, so
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:32.620]   I don't know
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:34.620]   the answer. I think this is one of the
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:36.620]   reasons why it's great that we work as a team
[02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:38.620]   and there's other really good and smart people
[02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:40.620]   involved.
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:42.620]   But one of my
[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:44.620]   one of the things I've heard from smart people who've
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:46.620]   done a lot of this is that
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:48.620]   the packaging becomes a huge disaster
[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:50.620]   when you get the Python and C together.
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:52.620]   And so if you have this problem where
[02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:54.620]   you have code split between
[02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:56.620]   Python and C, now not only do
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:58.620]   you have to package the C code, you have to
[02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:00.620]   build the C code. C doesn't
[02:33:00.620 --> 02:33:02.620]   have a package manager, right?
[02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:04.620]   C doesn't have a dependency versioning
[02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:06.620]   management system, right? And so
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:08.620]   I'm not experienced in the state
[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:10.620]   of the art and
[02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:12.620]   all the different Python package managers,
[02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:14.620]   but my understanding is that's a massive
[02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.620]   part of the problem. And I think Mojo
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.620]   solves that part of the problem directly heads on.
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:20.620]   Now, one of the things I think
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:22.620]   we'll do with the community, and this isn't
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:24.620]   again, we're not solving all the world's
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:26.620]   problems at once, we have to be kind of focused to start
[02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:28.620]   with, is that I think that
[02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:30.620]   we will have an opportunity to reevaluate
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:32.620]   packaging. And so I think
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:34.620]   that we can come back and say, okay, well
[02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:36.620]   given the new tools and technologies and the cool
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:38.620]   things we have that we've built up, because we have
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:40.620]   not just syntax, we have an entirely
[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:42.620]   new compiler stack that works in a new way,
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:44.620]   maybe there's other innovations we can
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.620]   bring together and maybe we can help solve that problem.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:48.620]   So almost a tangent to that question
[02:33:48.620 --> 02:33:50.620]   from the user perspective of packages,
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:52.620]   it was always surprising
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:54.620]   to me that
[02:33:54.620 --> 02:33:56.620]   it was not easier to sort of
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:33:58.620]   explore and find packages.
[02:33:58.620 --> 02:34:02.620]   You know, with pip install,
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:04.620]   it just, it feels,
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:06.620]   it's an incredible ecosystem.
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:08.620]   It's just interesting
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:10.620]   that it wasn't made, it's still, I
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:12.620]   think, not made easier to discover packages
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:14.620]   to do like
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:16.620]   search
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:18.620]   and discovery,
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:20.620]   as YouTube calls it. Well, I mean,
[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.620]   it's kind of funny because this is one of the challenges
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.620]   of these like
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:26.620]   intentionally decentralized communities.
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:28.620]   And so I don't know what the right answer
[02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:30.620]   is for Python. I mean, there are many people
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:32.620]   that would, or I don't even
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:34.620]   know the right answer for Mojo.
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:36.620]   So there are many people that
[02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:38.620]   would have much more informed opinions than I do.
[02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:40.620]   But it's interesting if you look at this, right,
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:42.620]   open source communities,
[02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:44.620]   you know, there's Git.
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:46.620]   Git is a fully decentralized, anybody can do it
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:48.620]   any way they want, but then there's GitHub.
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:50.620]   Right, and GitHub centralized
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:52.620]   commercial in that case,
[02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:54.620]   right, thing, really
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:56.620]   helped pull together and help solve some of the discovery
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:58.620]   problems and help build a more
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:00.620]   consistent community. And so
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:02.620]   maybe there's opportunities for... For something like
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:04.620]   a GitHub for Python. Yeah. Although even
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:06.620]   GitHub, I might be wrong on this,
[02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:08.620]   but the search and discovery for GitHub is not
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:10.620]   that great.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:12.620]   Like I still use Google search,
[02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:14.620]   Yeah, well, I mean, maybe
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:16.620]   that's because GitHub doesn't want to replace Google search.
[02:35:16.620 --> 02:35:18.620]   Right?
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:20.620]   I think there is room for specialized
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:22.620]   solutions to specific problems.
[02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:24.620]   Sure. I don't know the right answer
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:26.620]   for GitHub either. That's...
[02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:28.620]   They can go figure that out.
[02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:30.620]   But the point is to have an interface that's
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:32.620]   usable, that's accessible to people of all different
[02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:34.620]   skill levels. Well, and again,
[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:36.620]   what are the benefits of standards, right? Standards
[02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:38.620]   allow you to build these next level up
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:40.620]   ecosystem, next level up infrastructure,
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:42.620]   next level up things. And so
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:44.620]   again, come back to...
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.620]   I hate complexity.
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:48.620]   C plus Python is complicated.
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:50.620]   It makes everything more difficult
[02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:52.620]   to deal with. It makes it difficult to port,
[02:35:52.620 --> 02:35:54.620]   move code around, work with.
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:56.620]   All these things get more complicated. And so
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:58.620]   I mean, I'm not an expert, but maybe
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:00.620]   Mojo can help a little bit by helping
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:02.620]   reduce the amount of C in this ecosystem
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:04.620]   and make it therefore scale better. So any kind of packages
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:06.620]   that are hybrid in nature
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:08.620]   would be a natural fit to
[02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:10.620]   move to Mojo. Which is a lot of them,
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:12.620]   by the way. Yeah.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:14.620]   A lot of them, especially that are doing some interesting stuff
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:16.620]   computation-wise.
[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:18.620]   Let me ask you about some features.
[02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:20.620]   Yeah. So we talked
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:22.620]   about, obviously, indentation, that it's a
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:24.620]   typed language or optionally
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:26.620]   typed. Is that the right way
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:28.620]   to say it? It's either optionally or progressively.
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:30.620]   Progressively. I think...
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:32.620]   So people have very strong opinions on the
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:34.620]   right word to use. Yeah.
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:36.620]   I don't know. I look forward to your letters.
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.620]   So there's the
[02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:40.620]   var versus let. But let is
[02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:42.620]   for constants. Yeah.
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.620]   var is an optional.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:46.620]   Yeah, var makes it mutable, so you can
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:48.620]   reassign. Okay.
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:50.620]   Then there's
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.620]   function overloading.
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:54.620]   Oh, okay. Yeah.
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:56.620]   I mean, there's a lot of source of happiness for me, but
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:58.620]   function overloading, that's...
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:00.620]   I guess, is that...
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:02.620]   Is that
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:04.620]   for performance? Or is that... Why does Python
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:06.620]   not have function overloading?
[02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:08.620]   So I can speculate.
[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:10.620]   Python is a dynamic language.
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.620]   The way it works is that
[02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:14.620]   Python and Objective-C
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:16.620]   are actually
[02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:18.620]   very similar worlds
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:20.620]   if you ignore syntax.
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:22.620]   And so
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:24.620]   Objective-C is straight line
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:26.620]   derived from Smalltalk,
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:28.620]   a really venerable,
[02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:30.620]   interesting language that
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:32.620]   much of the world has forgotten about, but the people that remember
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:34.620]   it love it, generally.
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:36.620]   And the way that Smalltalk works is that
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:38.620]   every object has a dictionary in it.
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:40.620]   And the dictionary maps from the name
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:42.620]   of a function, or the name of a value
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.620]   within an object, to its implementation.
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:46.620]   And so the way you call
[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:48.620]   a method in Objective-C is you say,
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.620]   "Go look up..." The way I call
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:52.620]   foo is I go look up foo, I get a pointer
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:54.620]   to the function back, and then I call it.
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:56.620]   That's how Python works.
[02:37:56.620 --> 02:37:58.620]   And so now the problem with that is that
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:00.620]   the dictionary within a Python
[02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:02.620]   object, all the keys are strings,
[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:04.620]   and it's a dictionary,
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:06.620]   so you can only have one entry per name.
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:08.620]   You think it's as simple as that?
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:10.620]   I think it's as simple as that. And so,
[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:12.620]   now, why do they never fix this
[02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:14.620]   like, why do they not change it to not be a dictionary?
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:16.620]   Why do they not change it to do other things?
[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:18.620]   Well, you don't
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:20.620]   really have to in Python,
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:22.620]   because it's dynamic. And so you can say,
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.620]   "I get into the function, now if
[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:26.620]   I got past an integer, do some dynamic
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:28.620]   tests for it. If it's a string,
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.620]   go do another thing." There's another
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:32.620]   additional challenge, which is, even if you did
[02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:34.620]   support overloading, you're saying, "Okay, well,
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:36.620]   here's a version of a function for integers and a
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:38.620]   function for strings." Well, you'd have
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:40.620]   to, even if you could put it in that dictionary, you'd have
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:42.620]   to have the caller do the dispatch.
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:44.620]   And so, every time you call the function, you'd
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:46.620]   have to say, "Is it an integer or is it a string?"
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.620]   And so you'd have to figure out where to do that test.
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:50.620]   And so, in a dynamic language,
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:52.620]   overloading is something you
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:54.620]   don't have to have.
[02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:56.620]   So, but now you get
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:38:58.620]   into a typed language, and
[02:38:58.620 --> 02:39:00.620]   in Python, if you subscript
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.620]   with an integer,
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:04.620]   then you get typically one
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:06.620]   element out of a collection. If you
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:08.620]   subscript with a range, you get
[02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:10.620]   a different thing out. And so
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:12.620]   often, in typed languages, you'll want
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:14.620]   to be able to express the fact that, "Cool,
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:16.620]   I have different behavior
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:18.620]   depending on what I actually pass into this thing."
[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:20.620]   If you can model that, it can make it safer
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:22.620]   and more predictable and faster and all
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:24.620]   these things. It somehow
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:26.620]   feels safer, yes, but it also
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:28.620]   feels empowering, in terms
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:30.620]   of clarity. You don't have to design
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:32.620]   different functions.
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:34.620]   This is also one of the challenges
[02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:36.620]   with the existing
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:38.620]   Python typing systems,
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:40.620]   is that in practice,
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:42.620]   you take subscript, in practice, a lot of these
[02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:44.620]   functions, they don't have one
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.620]   signature. They actually have different
[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:48.620]   behavior in different cases, and so
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:50.620]   this is why it's difficult to retrofit this
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:52.620]   into existing Python code and make it
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:54.620]   play well with typing.
[02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:56.620]   You kind of have to design
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:58.620]   for that. Okay, so there's an
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:00.620]   interesting distinction that
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:02.620]   people that program Python might be interested in,
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:04.620]   is def versus fn.
[02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:06.620]   So it's two different
[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:08.620]   ways to define a function.
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:10.620]   And fn
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:12.620]   is a stricter
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.620]   version of def. What's the coolness
[02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:16.620]   that comes from the strictness?
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:18.620]   So here you get into, what is the trade-off
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:20.620]   with a superset? Yes.
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:22.620]   Okay, so a superset.
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:24.620]   You have to, or you really want to be
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:26.620]   compatible. Like if you're doing a superset,
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:28.620]   you've decided compatibility
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:30.620]   with existing code is the important
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:32.620]   thing, even if some of the decisions
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:34.620]   they made were maybe not what you'd choose.
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:36.620]   Okay. So that means you
[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:38.620]   put a lot of time into compatibility, and
[02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:40.620]   it means that you get locked into decisions of the past,
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:42.620]   even if they may
[02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:44.620]   not have been a good thing.
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:46.620]   Now, systems programmers typically
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:48.620]   like to control things.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:50.620]   Right? And they want to make sure that
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:52.620]   you know, not in all cases of course,
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:54.620]   and even systems programmers are not one
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:56.620]   thing, right? But often you want
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:58.620]   predictability. And so one of the things
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:00.620]   that Python has, for example, as you know,
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:02.620]   is that if you define a variable, you just say
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:04.620]   x equals 4. I have a variable
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:06.620]   named x.
[02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:08.620]   Now I say some long name
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:10.620]   equals 17.
[02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:12.620]   Print out some long name,
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:14.620]   oops, but I typoed it.
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:16.620]   Right? Well, the compiler, the
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:18.620]   Python compiler doesn't know, in all
[02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:20.620]   cases, what you're defining and what you're
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:22.620]   using, and did you typo the use
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:24.620]   of it or the definition?
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:26.620]   Right? And so for people
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:28.620]   coming from typed languages,
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:30.620]   again, I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:32.620]   that drives them crazy because they want the compiler
[02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:34.620]   to tell them, you typoed the name of this thing.
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:36.620]   Right? And so what Fn does is it
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:38.620]   turns on, as you say, it's a strict mode.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:40.620]   And so it says, okay, well, you have to actually
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.620]   declare, intentionally declare your variables
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:44.620]   before you use them. That gives you more
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:46.620]   predictability, more error checking
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.620]   and things like this, but you don't have
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:50.620]   to, you don't have to
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:52.620]   use it. And this is
[02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:54.620]   a way that Mojo is both compatible,
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:56.620]   because defs work the same way that defs have
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:58.620]   already always worked, but it provides
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:00.620]   a new alternative that gives you more control and
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.620]   allows certain kinds of people that have a different
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:04.620]   philosophy to be able to express that and get that.
[02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:06.620]   But usually,
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.620]   if you're writing Mojo code from scratch,
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:10.620]   you'll be using Fn.
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.620]   It depends, again, it depends on your mentality
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:14.620]   right? It's not that
[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:16.620]   def is Python and Fn is
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:18.620]   Mojo. Mojo has both
[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:20.620]   and it loves both. It really depends on
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:22.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.620]   Are you playing around and scripting
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:26.620]   something out and is it a one-off throwaway script?
[02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:28.620]   Cool, like, Python is
[02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:30.620]   great at that. I'll still be using Fn,
[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:32.620]   but yeah. I love strictness.
[02:42:32.620 --> 02:42:34.620]   Okay, well, so. Control.
[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:36.620]   Power. You also like suffering,
[02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:38.620]   right? Yes.
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:40.620]   Go hand in hand. How many
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:42.620]   pull-ups?
[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.620]   I've lost count at this
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:46.620]   point. Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:48.620]   And that's cool. I love you for that.
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:50.620]   And I love other people who like strict things, right?
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:52.620]   But I don't want to say that
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:54.620]   that's the right thing because Python's also
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:56.620]   very beautiful for hacking around and doing stuff
[02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:58.620]   and research and these other cases where
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.620]   you may not want that. See, I just feel like
[02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:02.620]   maybe I'm wrong on that,
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:04.620]   but it feels like strictness leads to faster
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:06.620]   debugging. So in terms of going from
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:08.620]   even on a small
[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:10.620]   project from zero to completion,
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:12.620]   it just, I guess it depends
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.620]   how many bugs you generate usually.
[02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:16.620]   Well, so, I mean, it's, again, lessons
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:18.620]   learned in looking at the ecosystem. It's really,
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:20.620]   I mean, I think it's,
[02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:22.620]   if you study some of these languages over time,
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:24.620]   like the Ruby community, for example.
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:26.620]   Now, Ruby is a pretty well
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:28.620]   developed, pretty established community,
[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:30.620]   but along their path, they really invested in
[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:32.620]   unit testing. So I think that
[02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:34.620]   the Ruby community has really pushed
[02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.620]   forward the state of the art of testing
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:38.620]   because they didn't have a type system that
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:40.620]   caught a lot of bugs at compile time,
[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:42.620]   right? And so you can have the best
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.620]   of both worlds. You can have good testing and good types,
[02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:46.620]   right? And things like this. But I thought that
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:48.620]   it was really interesting to see how
[02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:50.620]   certain challenges get solved. And in Python,
[02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:52.620]   for example, the interactive
[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:54.620]   notebook kind of experiences and stuff like this are
[02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:56.620]   really amazing. And if you typo something,
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:58.620]   it doesn't matter. It just tells you. It's fine.
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:00.620]   Right? And so I think that the trade-offs
[02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:02.620]   are very different if you're building a
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:04.620]   large-scale production system
[02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:06.620]   versus you're building and exploring a notebook.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:08.620]   Speaking of control, the
[02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:10.620]   hilarious thing, if you look at code I write just
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:12.620]   for myself for fun, it's like
[02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:14.620]   littered with asserts everywhere.
[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.620]   It's a kind of...
[02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:18.620]   Yeah, you'd like types.
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:20.620]   It's basically
[02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:22.620]   saying
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:24.620]   in a dictatorial way, "This should be
[02:44:24.620 --> 02:44:26.620]   true now, otherwise everything stops."
[02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:28.620]   Well, and
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:30.620]   that is the sign.
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:32.620]   I love you, man. But
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:34.620]   that is a sign of somebody who likes control.
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:36.620]   And so yes, I think that you'll like
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.620]   FN. I think you'll like Mojo.
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:40.620]   Therapy session. Yes, I definitely
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:42.620]   will. Speaking of
[02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:44.620]   asserts, exceptions
[02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:46.620]   are called errors. Why is it called
[02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:48.620]   errors? So we use
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:50.620]   the same...we're the same as Python.
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:52.620]   But we implement
[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.620]   it in a very different way. And so
[02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:56.620]   if you look at other languages, like
[02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:58.620]   we'll pick on C++, our favorite,
[02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:00.620]   C++ has a thing
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:02.620]   called zero-cost exception handling.
[02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:04.620]   And this is
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:06.620]   in my opinion
[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:08.620]   something to learn lessons from.
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:10.620]   It's a nice, polite way
[02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:12.620]   of saying it. And so
[02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:14.620]   zero-cost exception
[02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:16.620]   handling, the way it works is that
[02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:18.620]   it's called zero-cost because
[02:45:18.620 --> 02:45:20.620]   if you don't throw an exception,
[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:22.620]   there's supposed to be no overhead
[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:24.620]   for the non-error code.
[02:45:24.620 --> 02:45:26.620]   And so it takes the error path out
[02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:28.620]   of the
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:30.620]   common path.
[02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:32.620]   It does this by making throwing
[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:34.620]   an error extremely expensive.
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:36.620]   And so if you actually throw an error
[02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:38.620]   with a C++ compiler using exceptions,
[02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:40.620]   it has to go look up in tables on
[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:42.620]   the side and do all this stuff. And so throwing an error
[02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:44.620]   could be like 10,000 times
[02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:46.620]   more expensive than returning from a function.
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:48.620]   Also,
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:50.620]   it's called zero-cost exceptions, but it's not zero-cost
[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:52.620]   by any stretch of the imagination
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:54.620]   because it massively bloats out your code,
[02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:56.620]   your binary. It also
[02:45:56.620 --> 02:45:58.620]   adds a whole bunch of different
[02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:00.620]   paths because of destructors and other
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:02.620]   things like that that exist in C++.
[02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:04.620]   And it reduces the number of optimizations,
[02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:06.620]   it has all these effects. And so
[02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:08.620]   this thing that was called zero-cost exceptions,
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:10.620]   it really ain't.
[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:12.620]   Okay?
[02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:14.620]   Now, if you fast forward to
[02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:16.620]   newer languages,
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:18.620]   and this includes Swift and Rust and Go
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:20.620]   and now Mojo,
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:24.620]   well, and Python's a little bit different because it's
[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:26.620]   interpreted, and so it's got a little bit of a different
[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:28.620]   thing going on. But if you look at compiled
[02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:30.620]   languages,
[02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:32.620]   many newer languages
[02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:34.620]   say, "Okay, well, let's not do that
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:36.620]   zero-cost exception handling thing.
[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:38.620]   Let's actually
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:40.620]   throw an error the same as
[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:42.620]   returning a
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:44.620]   variant, returning either the normal
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:46.620]   result or an error."
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:48.620]   Now, programmers
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:50.620]   generally don't want to deal
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:52.620]   with all the typing machinery and
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:54.620]   pushing around a variant.
[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:56.620]   And so you use all the syntax that Python
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:58.620]   gives us, for example, try and catch,
[02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:00.620]   functions that raise
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:02.620]   and things like this. You can put a raises
[02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:04.620]   decorator on your functions, stuff like
[02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:06.620]   this, if you want to control that.
[02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:08.620]   And then the language
[02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:10.620]   can provide syntax for it, but under the hood,
[02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:12.620]   the way the computer executes it,
[02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:14.620]   throwing an error is basically as fast
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:16.620]   as returning something.
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:18.620]   So it's exactly the same way from a compiled perspective.
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:20.620]   And so this is actually,
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:22.620]   I mean, it's a fairly nerdy thing,
[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:24.620]   right? Which is why I love it.
[02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:26.620]   But this has a huge
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:28.620]   impact on the way you design your APIs.
[02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:30.620]   So in C++,
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:32.620]   huge communities
[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:34.620]   turn off exceptions
[02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:36.620]   because the cost is just so high.
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:38.620]   And so the zero-cost
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:40.620]   cost is so high, right?
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:42.620]   And so that means you can't actually use
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:44.620]   exceptions in many libraries.
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:46.620]   Interesting.
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:48.620]   And even for the people that do use it,
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.620]   well, okay, how and when
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:52.620]   do you want to pay the cost? If I try to open
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:54.620]   a file, should I throw an error?
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:56.620]   Well, what if I'm probing
[02:47:56.620 --> 02:47:58.620]   around looking for something, right?
[02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:00.620]   I'm looking it up and made different paths. Well, if it's really
[02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:02.620]   slow to do that, maybe I'll add another
[02:48:02.620 --> 02:48:04.620]   function that doesn't
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:06.620]   throw an error, or turns an error code instead,
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:08.620]   and now I have two different versions of the same
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:10.620]   thing, and so it causes you to fork your APIs.
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:12.620]   And so,
[02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:14.620]   you know, one of the things I learned from Apple
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:16.620]   and Nysa Love is the art of
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:18.620]   API design is actually really profound.
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:20.620]   I think this is something that Python's also done a pretty
[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:22.620]   good job at in terms of building
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:24.620]   out this large-scale package ecosystem. It's about
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:26.620]   having standards and things like this.
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:28.620]   And so, you know, we wouldn't want to enter a mode
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:30.620]   where, you know,
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:32.620]   there's this theoretical feature that exists in language
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:34.620]   but people don't use it in practice.
[02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:36.620]   Now, I'll also say, one of the other
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:38.620]   really cool things about this implementation
[02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:40.620]   approach is that it can run on GPUs, and it can run
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:42.620]   on accelerators and things like this. And
[02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:44.620]   that standard
[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:46.620]   zero-cost exception thing would never work on
[02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:48.620]   an accelerator. And so this is also part of how
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:50.620]   Mojo can scale all the way down to
[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:52.620]   little embedded systems and to
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:54.620]   running on GPUs and things like that.
[02:48:54.620 --> 02:48:56.620]   Can you actually say about
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:48:58.620]   maybe
[02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:00.620]   is there some high-level way
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:02.620]   to describe the challenge of
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:04.620]   exceptions and how they
[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:06.620]   work in code during compilation?
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:08.620]   So just this idea of
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:10.620]   percolating up a thing,
[02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:12.620]   an error. Yeah.
[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:14.620]   So the way to think about it is
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:16.620]   think about a function that doesn't return anything.
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:18.620]   Just as a simple case, right? And so you have
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:20.620]   function
[02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:22.620]   one calls function two,
[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:24.620]   calls function three, calls function four,
[02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:26.620]   along that call stack there are
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:28.620]   try blocks, right? And so if you have
[02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:30.620]   function one calls function two, function two
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:32.620]   has a try block, and then within it
[02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:34.620]   it calls function three, right?
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:36.620]   Well, what happens if function three throws?
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:38.620]   Well, actually,
[02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:40.620]   start simpler. What happens if it returns?
[02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:42.620]   Well, if it returns, it's supposed to go back out
[02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:44.620]   and continue executing and then fall off the bottom of the
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:46.620]   try block and keep going and all's good.
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:48.620]   If the function throws,
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:50.620]   you're supposed to exit the current function
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:52.620]   and then get into the accept
[02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:54.620]   clause, right? And then do whatever
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:56.620]   code's there and then keep following on and going on.
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:58.620]   And so the way that
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:00.620]   a compiler like Mojo works is that
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:02.620]   the call to that function,
[02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:04.620]   which happens in the accept block,
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:06.620]   calls a function, and then instead of returning
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:08.620]   nothing, it actually returns
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:10.620]   a variant between
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:12.620]   nothing and an error.
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:14.620]   And so if you return normally,
[02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:16.620]   fall off the bottom or do a return,
[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:18.620]   you return nothing.
[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:20.620]   And if you throw an error, you
[02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:22.620]   return the variant that
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:24.620]   is "I'm an error," right?
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:26.620]   So when you get to the call, you say, "Okay, cool,
[02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:28.620]   I called a function. Hey, I know locally
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:30.620]   I'm in a try block."
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:32.620]   And so I call the function and then
[02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:34.620]   I check to see what it returns. Aha,
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:36.620]   if it's that error thing, jump to the accept block.
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:38.620]   And that's all done for you
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:40.620]   behind the scenes. Exactly.
[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:42.620]   And so the compiler does all this for you.
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:44.620]   I mean, one of the things, if you dig into how this stuff works
[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:46.620]   in Python, it gets a little bit more complicated
[02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:48.620]   because you have finally blocks,
[02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:50.620]   which now you need to go into,
[02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:52.620]   do some stuff, and then
[02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.620]   those can also throw and return.
[02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:56.620]   Wait, what? Nested?
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:50:58.620]   Yeah, and the stuff matters for compatibility.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.620]   Really? You can nest them?
[02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:02.620]   There's with clauses, and so with clauses
[02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.620]   are kind of like finally blocks with some special
[02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:06.620]   stuff going on, and so there's...
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:08.620]   Nesting in general, nesting of anything,
[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:10.620]   nesting of functions, should be illegal.
[02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:12.620]   Well,
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:14.620]   it just feels like it adds a level of complexity.
[02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:16.620]   Lex, I'm merely an implementer,
[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:18.620]   and so this is again,
[02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:20.620]   one of the
[02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:22.620]   trade-offs you get when you decide to build a superset
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:24.620]   is you get to implement
[02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:26.620]   a full fidelity implementation of the thing
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:28.620]   that you decided is good,
[02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.620]   and so
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:32.620]   yeah, I mean, we can
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:34.620]   complain about the reality of the world
[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:36.620]   and shake our fist, but...
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:38.620]   It always feels like you shouldn't be allowed
[02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:40.620]   to do that, like to declare functions
[02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:42.620]   and set functions.
[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:44.620]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:46.620]   What happened to Lex, the Lisp guy?
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:48.620]   No, I understand that,
[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:50.620]   but Lisp is what I used to do
[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:52.620]   in college.
[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:54.620]   So now you've grown up?
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:56.620]   You know, we've all done things in college
[02:51:56.620 --> 02:51:58.620]   we're not proud of.
[02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:00.620]   I love Lisp, I love Lisp.
[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:02.620]   Yeah, I was gonna say, you're afraid of me
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:04.620]   irritating the whole internet?
[02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:06.620]   It worked as a joke
[02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:08.620]   in my head and it came out right.
[02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:10.620]   So nested functions are,
[02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.620]   joking aside, actually really great,
[02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:14.620]   for certain things, right?
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:16.620]   And so these are also called closures.
[02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:18.620]   Closures are pretty cool, and you can pass
[02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:20.620]   callbacks, there's a lot of good patterns.
[02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:22.620]   So speaking of which, I don't think
[02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:24.620]   you have
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:26.620]   nested functions implemented
[02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:28.620]   yet in Mojo.
[02:52:28.620 --> 02:52:30.620]   We don't have lambda syntax, but we do
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:32.620]   have nested functions.
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:34.620]   There's a few things on the roadmap that you have
[02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:36.620]   that would be cool to sort of
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:38.620]   just fly through, because it's interesting to see
[02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:40.620]   how many features
[02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:42.620]   there are in a language.
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:44.620]   And then you have to implement them.
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:46.620]   So first of all, there's tuple support.
[02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:48.620]   That has to do with some very specific
[02:52:48.620 --> 02:52:50.620]   aspects of it, like the parentheses
[02:52:50.620 --> 02:52:52.620]   or not parentheses, that.
[02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:54.620]   Yeah, this is just totally a syntactic thing.
[02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:56.620]   A syntactic thing.
[02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:58.620]   But it's cool still.
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:00.620]   So keyword arguments and functions?
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:02.620]   Yeah, so this is where in Python
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:04.620]   you can say, call a function
[02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:06.620]   x=4, and x is the name
[02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:08.620]   of the argument.
[02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:10.620]   That's a nice sort of self-documenting feature.
[02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:12.620]   Yeah, and again, this isn't rock-solid.
[02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:14.620]   It's not rocket science to implement.
[02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:16.620]   It's just on the list.
[02:53:16.620 --> 02:53:18.620]   The bigger features are things like traits.
[02:53:18.620 --> 02:53:20.620]   So traits are
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:22.620]   when you want to define abstract--
[02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:24.620]   So when you get into typed languages,
[02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:26.620]   you need the ability to write
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:28.620]   generics. And so you want to say,
[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:30.620]   I want to write this function, and now I want to work on
[02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:32.620]   all things that are arithmetic-like.
[02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:34.620]   Well, what does arithmetic-like mean?
[02:53:34.620 --> 02:53:36.620]   Well, arithmetic-like is a
[02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:38.620]   categorization of a bunch of types.
[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:40.620]   And so,
[02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:42.620]   again, you can define it in many different ways, and I'm not going to go into
[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:44.620]   ring theory or something.
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:46.620]   But you can say it's
[02:53:46.620 --> 02:53:48.620]   arithmetic-like if you can add, subtract, multiply, divide it.
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:50.620]   For example.
[02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:52.620]   And so what you're saying is you're saying
[02:53:52.620 --> 02:53:54.620]   there's a set of traits that apply
[02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:56.620]   to a broad variety of types.
[02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:58.620]   And so there are
[02:53:58.620 --> 02:54:00.620]   all these types of arithmetic-like, all these tensors,
[02:54:00.620 --> 02:54:02.620]   and floating point, integer, and like
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:04.620]   there's this category of types.
[02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:06.620]   And then I can define on an orthogonal
[02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:08.620]   axis algorithms that
[02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:10.620]   then work against types that have those properties.
[02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:12.620]   And so this is
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:14.620]   a, again, it's a widely known
[02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:16.620]   thing. It's been implemented in Swift
[02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:18.620]   and Rust and many languages.
[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:20.620]   So it's not Haskell.
[02:54:20.620 --> 02:54:22.620]   Which is where everybody learns
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:24.620]   their tricks from.
[02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:26.620]   But we need to
[02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:28.620]   implement that, and that will enable a new level
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:30.620]   of expressivity.
[02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:32.620]   So classes. Yeah, classes are a big deal.
[02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:34.620]   It's a big deal
[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:36.620]   still to be implemented.
[02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:38.620]   Like you said, lambda
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:40.620]   syntax. And then there's like
[02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:42.620]   detail stuff like whole module import.
[02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:46.620]   Support for top level code
[02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:48.620]   and file scope.
[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:50.620]   And then global variables also.
[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:52.620]   So being able to have
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:54.620]   variables outside of a top level.
[02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:56.620]   And so this comes back to where Mojo came from.
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:54:58.620]   And the fact that this is your point one.
[02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:00.620]   Right, and so
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:02.620]   we're building, so Modular's building an AI stack.
[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:04.620]   Right, and an AI stack has
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:06.620]   a bunch of problems working with hardware
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:08.620]   and writing high performance kernels
[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:10.620]   and doing this kernel fusion thing I was talking about.
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:12.620]   And getting the most out of the hardware.
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:14.620]   And so we've really prioritized and built
[02:55:14.620 --> 02:55:16.620]   Mojo to solve Modular's problem.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:18.620]   Right, now
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:20.620]   our North Star is build out and support all
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:22.620]   the things. And so we're making incredible
[02:55:22.620 --> 02:55:24.620]   progress. By the way, Mojo's only like seven months
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:26.620]   old. So that's
[02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:28.620]   another interesting thing. I mean, part of the reason
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:30.620]   I wanted to mention some of these things is like
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:32.620]   there's a lot to do
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:34.620]   and it's pretty cool how you just kind of
[02:55:34.620 --> 02:55:36.620]   sometimes you take for
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:38.620]   granted how much there is in a programming language.
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:40.620]   How many cool features you kind of rely on. And this is
[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:42.620]   kind of a nice reminder when you
[02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:44.620]   lay it as a to-do list.
[02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:46.620]   Yeah, and so I mean, but also you look into
[02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:48.620]   it's amazing how much is also
[02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:50.620]   there. And you take it for granted that
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:52.620]   a value
[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:54.620]   if you define it, it will get
[02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:56.620]   destroyed automatically.
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:55:58.620]   Like that little feature itself is actually
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:00.620]   really complicated given the way the
[02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:02.620]   ownership system has to work. And
[02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:04.620]   the way that works within Mojo is a huge step
[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:06.620]   forward from what Rust and Swift have done.
[02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:08.620]   Can you say that again? When a value
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:10.620]   when you define it gets destroyed automatically. Yeah, so like
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:12.620]   say you have a string. So you just find a string
[02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:14.620]   on the stack. Or whatever
[02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:16.620]   that means. Like in your local function.
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.620]   Right? And so you say
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:20.620]   like whether it be in a def
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:22.620]   and so you just say x equals
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:24.620]   hello world. Right? Well, if
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:26.620]   your string type requires you to allocate
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:28.620]   memory, then when it's destroyed
[02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:30.620]   you have to deallocate it.
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:32.620]   So in Python and in Mojo you define that with
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:34.620]   the del method. Right?
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:36.620]   Where does that get run?
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:40.620]   Well, it gets run
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:42.620]   sometime between the last use
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:44.620]   of the value and
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:46.620]   the end of the program.
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:48.620]   Like in this, you now get into
[02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:50.620]   garbage collection. You get into like all these
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:52.620]   long debated, you talk about
[02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:54.620]   religions and
[02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:56.620]   trade-offs and things like this. This is a
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:56:58.620]   hugely hotly contested world.
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:00.620]   If you look at C++
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:02.620]   the way this works is that
[02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:04.620]   if you define a variable or a set
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:06.620]   of variables within a function,
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:08.620]   they get destroyed in a last in
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:10.620]   first out order.
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:12.620]   So it's like nesting.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.620]   This has a huge problem
[02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:16.620]   because if you define, you have a big scope
[02:57:16.620 --> 02:57:18.620]   and you define a whole bunch of values at the top
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:20.620]   and then you use them and then you do a whole
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:22.620]   bunch of code that doesn't use them,
[02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:24.620]   they don't get destroyed until the very end of that scope.
[02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:26.620]   And so
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:28.620]   this also destroys tail calls.
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:30.620]   Good functional programming. This has
[02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:32.620]   a bunch of different impacts on
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:34.620]   you talk about reference counting
[02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:36.620]   optimizations and things like this. A bunch of very
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.620]   low level things. And so what Mojo
[02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:40.620]   does is it has a different approach on it.
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:42.620]   It's a different approach on that from
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:44.620]   any language I'm familiar with where it destroys them
[02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:46.620]   as soon as possible.
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:48.620]   And by doing that you get better memory use,
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:50.620]   you get better predictability, you get tail calls
[02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:52.620]   that work, you get a bunch of other things,
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:54.620]   you get better ownership tracking. There's a bunch
[02:57:54.620 --> 02:57:56.620]   of these very simple things
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:57:58.620]   that are very fundamental
[02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:00.620]   that are already built in there in Mojo today
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:02.620]   that are the things that nobody
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:04.620]   talks about generally, but when they don't
[02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:06.620]   work right you find out and you have to
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:08.620]   complain about.
[02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:10.620]   Is it trivial to know
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:12.620]   what's the soonest possible to delete a thing
[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:14.620]   that's not going to be used again?
[02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:16.620]   It's generally trivial. It's after
[02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:18.620]   the last use of it. So if you define x as a
[02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:20.620]   string and then you have some use
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:22.620]   of x somewhere in your code. Within that scope?
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:24.620]   Within a scope that's accessible?
[02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:26.620]   Yeah, exactly. So you can only
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:28.620]   use something within its scope.
[02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:30.620]   So then it doesn't wait until the end of the scope
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:32.620]   to delete it. It destroys it
[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:34.620]   after the last use.
[02:58:34.620 --> 02:58:36.620]   So there's kind of some very eager machine
[02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:38.620]   that's just sitting there and deleting.
[02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:40.620]   Yeah, and it's all in the compiler so it's not at runtime.
[02:58:40.620 --> 02:58:42.620]   It's also cool.
[02:58:42.620 --> 02:58:44.620]   Interesting.
[02:58:44.620 --> 02:58:46.620]   And this is actually non-trivial because
[02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:48.620]   you have control flow.
[02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:50.620]   So it gets complicated pretty quickly and so
[02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:52.620]   getting this right was not...
[02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:54.620]   So you have to insert delete in a lot of places.
[02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:56.620]   Potentially, yeah. Exactly.
[02:58:56.620 --> 02:58:58.620]   So the compiler has to reason about this and this is where
[02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:00.620]   again, it's experience building languages and not getting
[02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:02.620]   this right. So again, you get another chance
[02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:04.620]   to do it and you get basic things
[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:06.620]   like this right. But it's extremely
[02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:08.620]   powerful when you do that.
[02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:10.620]   So there's a bunch of things like that that kind of
[02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:12.620]   combine together.
[02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:14.620]   And this comes back to the... You get a chance to do it
[02:59:14.620 --> 02:59:16.620]   the right way, do it the right way and make sure
[02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:18.620]   that every brick you put down is really good
[02:59:18.620 --> 02:59:20.620]   so that when you put more bricks on top of it
[02:59:20.620 --> 02:59:22.620]   they stack up to something that's beautiful.
[02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:24.620]   Well there's also...
[02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:26.620]   How many
[02:59:26.620 --> 02:59:28.620]   design discussions
[02:59:28.620 --> 02:59:30.620]   do there have to be about particular details
[02:59:30.620 --> 02:59:32.620]   like implementation of particular small features?
[02:59:32.620 --> 02:59:34.620]   Because the features that
[02:59:34.620 --> 02:59:36.620]   seem small,
[02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:38.620]   I bet some of them might be
[02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:40.620]   really
[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:42.620]   require really big design decisions.
[02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:44.620]   Yeah. Well so, I mean let me give you
[02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:46.620]   another example of this. Python has a feature
[02:59:46.620 --> 02:59:48.620]   called async await. So it's
[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:50.620]   a new feature, I mean
[02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:52.620]   in the long arc of Python history
[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:54.620]   it's a relatively new feature
[02:59:54.620 --> 02:59:56.620]   right, that allows way
[02:59:56.620 --> 02:59:58.620]   more expressive asynchronous programming.
[02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:00.620]   Okay. Again this is
[03:00:00.620 --> 03:00:02.620]   a... Python's a beautiful thing and
[03:00:02.620 --> 03:00:04.620]   they did things that are great for Mojo
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:06.620]   for completely different reasons.
[03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:08.620]   The reason the async await got added
[03:00:08.620 --> 03:00:10.620]   to Python, as far as I know,
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:12.620]   is because Python doesn't support threads.
[03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:14.620]   Okay. And so
[03:00:14.620 --> 03:00:16.620]   Python doesn't support threads
[03:00:16.620 --> 03:00:18.620]   but you want to work with networking
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:20.620]   and other things like that that can block.
[03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:22.620]   I mean Python does support threads, it's just not
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:24.620]   its strength. And so
[03:00:24.620 --> 03:00:26.620]   they added
[03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:28.620]   this feature called async await. It's also seen in other
[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:30.620]   languages like Swift and
[03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:32.620]   JavaScript and many other places as well.
[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:34.620]   Async await in Mojo is
[03:00:34.620 --> 03:00:36.620]   amazing! Because we have a high performance
[03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:38.620]   heterogeneous compute runtime underneath the
[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:40.620]   covers that then allows
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:42.620]   non-blocking I/O
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:44.620]   so you get full use of your accelerator.
[03:00:44.620 --> 03:00:46.620]   That's huge!
[03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:48.620]   Turns out. It's actually really an important part of
[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:50.620]   fully utilizing the machine.
[03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:52.620]   You talk about design discussions,
[03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:54.620]   that took a lot of discussions, right?
[03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:56.620]   And it probably will require more iteration.
[03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:58.620]   And so my philosophy with Mojo
[03:00:58.620 --> 03:01:00.620]   is that we have a small team of
[03:01:00.620 --> 03:01:02.620]   really good people that are pushing forward and they're
[03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:04.620]   very good at the extremely
[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.620]   deep knowing how the compiler and runtime
[03:01:06.620 --> 03:01:08.620]   and all the low level stuff
[03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:10.620]   works together.
[03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:12.620]   But they're not perfect. Same thing as the Swift team.
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:14.620]   And this is where one of the reasons
[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:16.620]   we released Mojo much earlier
[03:01:16.620 --> 03:01:18.620]   is so we can get feedback. And we've already
[03:01:18.620 --> 03:01:20.620]   renamed a keyword
[03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.620]   due to community feedback.
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:24.620]   We used an
[03:01:24.620 --> 03:01:26.620]   ampersand and now it's named in/out.
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:28.620]   We're not renaming existing Python keywords
[03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:30.620]   because that breaks compatibility.
[03:01:30.620 --> 03:01:32.620]   We're renaming things we're adding.
[03:01:32.620 --> 03:01:34.620]   And making sure that they are designed
[03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:36.620]   well, we get usage experience,
[03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:38.620]   we iterate and work with the community because
[03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:40.620]   again, if you scale something really fast in your
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:42.620]   code and everybody writes all their code and they start using it in production
[03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:44.620]   then it's impossible to change.
[03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:46.620]   And so you want to learn from people, you want to
[03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:48.620]   iterate and work on that early on.
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:50.620]   And this is where design discussions, it's
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:52.620]   actually quite important.
[03:01:52.620 --> 03:01:54.620]   Could you incorporate an emoji into the language?
[03:01:54.620 --> 03:01:56.620]   Into the main language?
[03:01:56.620 --> 03:01:58.620]   I could. Do you have a favorite one?
[03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:00.620]   Well I really like
[03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:02.620]   in terms of humor, I like
[03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:04.620]   "rawful" whatever,
[03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:06.620]   "rawing on the floor laughing."
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:08.620]   So that could be like a
[03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:10.620]   what would that be the use case for that?
[03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:12.620]   Throw an exception of some sort?
[03:02:12.620 --> 03:02:14.620]   You should totally file a feature request.
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:18.620]   Or maybe a hard one, it has to be a hard one.
[03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:20.620]   People have told me that
[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:22.620]   I'm insane, so this is
[03:02:22.620 --> 03:02:24.620]   I'm liking this.
[03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:26.620]   I'm going to use the viral nature
[03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:28.620]   of the internet to actually get this
[03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:30.620]   passed.
[03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:32.620]   It's funny, you come back to the flame emoji file extension,
[03:02:32.620 --> 03:02:34.620]   right?
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:36.620]   We have the option to use
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:38.620]   the flame emoji, which
[03:02:38.620 --> 03:02:40.620]   even that concept
[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:42.620]   for example, the people at GitHub say,
[03:02:42.620 --> 03:02:44.620]   "Now I've seen everything."
[03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:46.620]   Yeah, there's something
[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:48.620]   it's kind of reinvigorating.
[03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:50.620]   It's like,
[03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:52.620]   "Oh, that's possible. That's really cool."
[03:02:52.620 --> 03:02:54.620]   For some reason that makes
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:56.620]   everything else seem really exciting.
[03:02:56.620 --> 03:02:58.620]   I think the world is ready for this stuff.
[03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:00.620]   When we have a package manager, we'll clearly have to
[03:03:00.620 --> 03:03:02.620]   innovate by having the compiled package
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:04.620]   thing be the little box with the
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:06.620]   bow on it, right?
[03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:08.620]   It has to be done.
[03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:10.620]   It has to be done. Is there some stuff on there?
[03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:12.620]   Is there something on the roadmap that you're particularly
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:14.620]   stressed about or excited about
[03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:16.620]   that you're thinking about a lot?
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:18.620]   As a today snapshot, which will be
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:20.620]   obsolete tomorrow, the lifetime stuff
[03:03:20.620 --> 03:03:22.620]   is really exciting.
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:24.620]   Lifetimes give you safe
[03:03:24.620 --> 03:03:26.620]   references to memory without dangling
[03:03:26.620 --> 03:03:28.620]   pointers. This has been done
[03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:30.620]   in languages like Rust before, so we have a new approach
[03:03:30.620 --> 03:03:32.620]   which is really cool. I'm very excited about that.
[03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:34.620]   That'll be out to the community very soon.
[03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:36.620]   The traits feature
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:38.620]   is really a big deal.
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:40.620]   That's blocking a lot of API data
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:42.620]   design, and so there's that. I think that's
[03:03:42.620 --> 03:03:44.620]   really exciting.
[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:46.620]   A lot of it is these
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:48.620]   table stakes features.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:50.620]   One of the things that is, again,
[03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:52.620]   also lessons learned with Swift,
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:54.620]   is that
[03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:56.620]   programmers in general like
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:03:58.620]   to add syntactic sugar.
[03:03:58.620 --> 03:04:00.620]   It's like, "Oh, well this annoying
[03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:02.620]   thing, like in Python,
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:04.620]   you have to spell it underbar underbar add.
[03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:06.620]   Why can't I just use plus?
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:08.620]   Def plus, come on. Why can't
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:10.620]   I just do that?" So, trivial bit of
[03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:12.620]   syntactic sugar. It makes sense.
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:14.620]   It's beautiful. It's obvious. We're trying
[03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:16.620]   not to do that.
[03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:18.620]   And so, for two different
[03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:20.620]   reasons, one of which is that,
[03:04:20.620 --> 03:04:22.620]   again, lesson learned with Swift. Swift has a lot of
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:24.620]   syntactic sugar,
[03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:26.620]   which may be
[03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:28.620]   a good thing, maybe not. I don't know.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:30.620]   But because it's such an
[03:04:30.620 --> 03:04:32.620]   easy and addictive thing to do, sugar
[03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:34.620]   makes your blood get crazy,
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:36.620]   the community
[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:38.620]   will really dig into that and want to do a lot of that.
[03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:40.620]   And I think it's very distracting from building
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:42.620]   core abstractions. The second is,
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:44.620]   we want to be a good member of the Python community.
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:48.620]   And so, we want to work with the broader
[03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:50.620]   Python community, and
[03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:52.620]   yeah, we're pushing forward a bunch of systems
[03:04:52.620 --> 03:04:54.620]   programming features, and we need to build them out to
[03:04:54.620 --> 03:04:56.620]   understand them. But once we get a long
[03:04:56.620 --> 03:04:58.620]   ways forward, I want to make sure that we go
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:00.620]   back to the Python community and say, "Okay, let's do some
[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:02.620]   design reviews. Let's actually talk about this stuff. Let's
[03:05:02.620 --> 03:05:04.620]   figure out how we want this stuff all to work together."
[03:05:04.620 --> 03:05:06.620]   And syntactic sugar just
[03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:08.620]   makes all that more complicated.
[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:10.620]   And yeah, list comprehension
[03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:12.620]   is yet to be implemented.
[03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:14.620]   And my favorite, I mean,
[03:05:14.620 --> 03:05:16.620]   dictionaries.
[03:05:16.620 --> 03:05:18.620]   Yeah, there's some basic stuff. 0.1.
[03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:20.620]   0.1.
[03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:22.620]   Yeah, but nonetheless, it's actually still quite interesting
[03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:24.620]   and useful. As you mentioned, Modular
[03:05:24.620 --> 03:05:26.620]   is very new.
[03:05:26.620 --> 03:05:28.620]   Mojo is very new.
[03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:30.620]   It's a relatively small team
[03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:32.620]   that's building up this
[03:05:32.620 --> 03:05:34.620]   gigantic stack,
[03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:36.620]   this incredible stack that's going to
[03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:38.620]   perhaps define the future
[03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:40.620]   of development
[03:05:40.620 --> 03:05:42.620]   of our AI overlords.
[03:05:42.620 --> 03:05:44.620]   We just hope it will be
[03:05:44.620 --> 03:05:46.620]   useful.
[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:48.620]   As do all of us.
[03:05:48.620 --> 03:05:50.620]   So what have you learned
[03:05:50.620 --> 03:05:52.620]   from this process
[03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:54.620]   of building up a team? Maybe one
[03:05:54.620 --> 03:05:56.620]   question is, how do you hire
[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:58.620]   great programmers,
[03:05:58.620 --> 03:06:00.620]   great people that operate
[03:06:00.620 --> 03:06:02.620]   in this compiler,
[03:06:02.620 --> 03:06:04.620]   hardware,
[03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:06.620]   machine learning,
[03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:08.620]   software,
[03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:10.620]   interface design space,
[03:06:10.620 --> 03:06:12.620]   and maybe are a little bit fluid
[03:06:12.620 --> 03:06:14.620]   in what they can do?
[03:06:14.620 --> 03:06:16.620]   Language design, too.
[03:06:16.620 --> 03:06:18.620]   So building a company is just as interesting
[03:06:18.620 --> 03:06:20.620]   in different ways as building
[03:06:20.620 --> 03:06:22.620]   a language. Like different skill sets,
[03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:24.620]   different things, but super interesting.
[03:06:24.620 --> 03:06:26.620]   And I've built a lot of teams in a lot of different places.
[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:28.620]   If you zoom in
[03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:30.620]   from the big problem into recruiting,
[03:06:30.620 --> 03:06:32.620]   well, so here's our problem.
[03:06:32.620 --> 03:06:34.620]   Okay, I'll just
[03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:36.620]   be very straightforward about this.
[03:06:36.620 --> 03:06:38.620]   We started Modular with a lot of conviction
[03:06:38.620 --> 03:06:40.620]   about, we understand the problems,
[03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:42.620]   we understand the customer pain points,
[03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:44.620]   we need to work backwards from the suffering
[03:06:44.620 --> 03:06:46.620]   in the industry, and if we solve those problems
[03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:48.620]   we think it will be useful for people.
[03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:50.620]   But the problem is, is that the people
[03:06:50.620 --> 03:06:52.620]   we need to hire, as you say,
[03:06:52.620 --> 03:06:54.620]   are all these super specialized people
[03:06:54.620 --> 03:06:56.620]   that have jobs at big tech
[03:06:56.620 --> 03:06:58.620]   worlds.
[03:06:58.620 --> 03:07:00.620]   And I don't think
[03:07:00.620 --> 03:07:02.620]   we have product market fit
[03:07:02.620 --> 03:07:04.620]   in the way that a normal startup
[03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:06.620]   does, or we don't have product market fit
[03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:08.620]   challenges, because right now
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:10.620]   everybody's using AI and so many of them are suffering
[03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:12.620]   and they want help.
[03:07:12.620 --> 03:07:14.620]   And so, again, we started with strong conviction.
[03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:16.620]   Now, again, you have to hire
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:18.620]   and recruit the best, and the best all have jobs.
[03:07:18.620 --> 03:07:20.620]   And so what we've done is we've said, okay, well
[03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:22.620]   let's build an amazing culture.
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:24.620]   Start with that. That's usually not
[03:07:24.620 --> 03:07:26.620]   something a company starts with. Usually you
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:28.620]   hire a bunch of people and then people start
[03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:30.620]   fighting and it turns into a gigantic mess.
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:32.620]   And then you try to figure out how to improve
[03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:34.620]   your culture later. My co-founder
[03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:36.620]   Tim in particular is super passionate about making
[03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:38.620]   sure that that's right, and we've spent
[03:07:38.620 --> 03:07:40.620]   a lot of time early on to make sure that we
[03:07:40.620 --> 03:07:42.620]   can scale. Can you comment, sorry,
[03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:44.620]   before we get to the second, what makes for
[03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:46.620]   a good culture?
[03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:48.620]   So, I mean, there's many different cultures, and I have
[03:07:48.620 --> 03:07:50.620]   learned many things from many different people.
[03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:52.620]   Yeah, you worked with several very unique,
[03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:54.620]   almost famously unique
[03:07:54.620 --> 03:07:56.620]   cultures. And some of them I learned what to do,
[03:07:56.620 --> 03:07:58.620]   and some of them I learned what not to do.
[03:07:58.620 --> 03:08:00.620]   And so,
[03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:02.620]   we want an inclusive
[03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:04.620]   culture. I believe
[03:08:04.620 --> 03:08:06.620]   in, like,
[03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:08.620]   amazing people working together.
[03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:10.620]   And so I've seen cultures where people
[03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:12.620]   you have amazing people and they're fighting each other.
[03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:14.620]   I see amazing people and they're
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:16.620]   told what to do.
[03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:18.620]   Like, "Thou shalt line up and do what I say.
[03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.620]   It doesn't matter if it's the right thing. Do it."
[03:08:20.620 --> 03:08:22.620]   Right? And neither of these is the
[03:08:22.620 --> 03:08:24.620]   and I've seen people that have no direction
[03:08:24.620 --> 03:08:26.620]   they're just kind of floating in different places.
[03:08:26.620 --> 03:08:28.620]   And they want to be amazing, they just don't
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:30.620]   know how. And so a lot of it starts with
[03:08:30.620 --> 03:08:32.620]   have a clear vision.
[03:08:32.620 --> 03:08:34.620]   Right? And so we have a clear vision of what we're doing.
[03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:36.620]   And so I
[03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:38.620]   kind of grew up at Apple in my engineering
[03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:40.620]   life, right? And so a lot of
[03:08:40.620 --> 03:08:42.620]   the Apple DNA rubbed off on me.
[03:08:42.620 --> 03:08:44.620]   My co-founder Tim also
[03:08:44.620 --> 03:08:46.620]   is like a strong product guy. And so what we
[03:08:46.620 --> 03:08:48.620]   learned is, you know, I was taught at
[03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:50.620]   Apple that you don't work from
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:52.620]   building cool technology. You don't
[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:54.620]   work from, like, come up with a cool product
[03:08:54.620 --> 03:08:56.620]   and think about the features you'll have in the big check boxes
[03:08:56.620 --> 03:08:58.620]   and stuff like this.
[03:08:58.620 --> 03:09:00.620]   Because if you go talk to customers, they don't actually care about your product.
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:02.620]   They don't care about your technology.
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:04.620]   What they care about is their
[03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:06.620]   problems. Right?
[03:09:06.620 --> 03:09:08.620]   And if your product can help solve their
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.620]   problems, well hey, they might be interested in that.
[03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:12.620]   Right? And so if you speak to them
[03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:14.620]   about their problems, if you understand and you have compassion,
[03:09:14.620 --> 03:09:16.620]   you understand what people are working with,
[03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:18.620]   then you can work backwards to building an amazing
[03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:20.620]   product. So the vision starts by
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:22.620]   defining the problem. And then you can work
[03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:24.620]   backwards in solving technology. Got it.
[03:09:24.620 --> 03:09:26.620]   And at Apple, like it's, I think, pretty famously
[03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:28.620]   said that, you know, for every
[03:09:28.620 --> 03:09:30.620]   you know, there's
[03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:32.620]   a hundred no's for every yes.
[03:09:32.620 --> 03:09:34.620]   I would refine that to say that there's a hundred
[03:09:34.620 --> 03:09:36.620]   not yets for every yes.
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:38.620]   But famously, if you go back to the
[03:09:38.620 --> 03:09:40.620]   iPhone, for example, right? The iPhone 1,
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:42.620]   I mean, many people laughed at it
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:44.620]   because it didn't have 3G, it didn't have
[03:09:44.620 --> 03:09:46.620]   copy and paste.
[03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:48.620]   Right? And then a year later,
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:50.620]   okay, finally it has 3G, but
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:52.620]   it still doesn't have copy and paste, it's a joke.
[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:54.620]   Nobody will ever use this product, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:56.620]   Right? Well, year three
[03:09:56.620 --> 03:09:58.620]   it had copy and paste, and
[03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:00.620]   people stopped talking about it. Right?
[03:10:00.620 --> 03:10:02.620]   And so being laser focused
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:04.620]   and having conviction, understanding
[03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:06.620]   what the core problems are, and giving
[03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:08.620]   the team the space to be able to build the right
[03:10:08.620 --> 03:10:10.620]   tech is really important.
[03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:12.620]   Also, I mean, you come back
[03:10:12.620 --> 03:10:14.620]   to recruiting, you have to pay well.
[03:10:14.620 --> 03:10:16.620]   Right? So we have to pay
[03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:18.620]   industry leading salaries and have good benefits and things
[03:10:18.620 --> 03:10:20.620]   like this, that's a big piece.
[03:10:20.620 --> 03:10:22.620]   We're a remote first company,
[03:10:22.620 --> 03:10:24.620]   and so we have to
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:26.620]   so
[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:28.620]   remote first has a
[03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:30.620]   very strong set of pros and cons.
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:32.620]   On the one hand, you can hire people
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:34.620]   from wherever they are, and you can
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:36.620]   attract amazing talent even if they live in
[03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:38.620]   strange places or unusual places.
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:40.620]   On the other hand, you have times
[03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:42.620]   where you have to go to different zones.
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:44.620]   On the other hand, you have like
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:46.620]   everybody on the internet will fight
[03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:48.620]   if they don't understand each other,
[03:10:48.620 --> 03:10:50.620]   and so we've had to learn how to
[03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:52.620]   have a system where we actually fly people in,
[03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:54.620]   and we get the whole company together periodically,
[03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:56.620]   and then we get work groups together,
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:10:58.620]   and we plan and execute together.
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:00.620]   There's like an intimacy to the in-person
[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:02.620]   brainstorming that I guess you lose,
[03:11:02.620 --> 03:11:04.620]   but maybe you don't. Maybe if you get to know each other well
[03:11:04.620 --> 03:11:06.620]   and you trust each other, maybe you can do that.
[03:11:06.620 --> 03:11:08.620]   Well, so when the pandemic first hit,
[03:11:08.620 --> 03:11:10.620]   I mean, I'm curious about your experience too.
[03:11:10.620 --> 03:11:12.620]   One thing I missed was having whiteboards.
[03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:14.620]   Yeah.
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:16.620]   Right? Those design discussions where you're like,
[03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:18.620]   "I can high intensity work through things,
[03:11:18.620 --> 03:11:20.620]   get things done, work through the problem of the day,
[03:11:20.620 --> 03:11:22.620]   understand where you're on,
[03:11:22.620 --> 03:11:24.620]   figure out and solve the problem, and move forward."
[03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:26.620]   Yeah.
[03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:28.620]   But we've figured out ways to work around that
[03:11:28.620 --> 03:11:30.620]   now with all these
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:32.620]   screen sharing and other things like that that we do.
[03:11:32.620 --> 03:11:34.620]   The thing I miss now
[03:11:34.620 --> 03:11:36.620]   is sitting down at a lunch table with the team.
[03:11:36.620 --> 03:11:38.620]   Yeah.
[03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:40.620]   The spontaneous things, like the coffee
[03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:42.620]   bar things, and the
[03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:44.620]   bumping into each other and getting to know
[03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:46.620]   people outside of the transactional
[03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:48.620]   "solve a problem over Zoom" thing.
[03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:50.620]   And I think there's just
[03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:52.620]   a lot of stuff that
[03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:54.620]   I'm not an expert at this, I don't know who is.
[03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:56.620]   Hopefully there's some people.
[03:11:56.620 --> 03:11:58.620]   But there's stuff that somehow is missing on Zoom.
[03:11:58.620 --> 03:12:00.620]   Even with the whiteboard,
[03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:02.620]   if you look at that,
[03:12:02.620 --> 03:12:04.620]   if you have a room with one person
[03:12:04.620 --> 03:12:06.620]   at the whiteboard and there's like three other people
[03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:08.620]   at a table,
[03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:10.620]   there's a
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:12.620]   first of all, there's a social aspect
[03:12:12.620 --> 03:12:14.620]   to that where you're just shooting the shit a little bit.
[03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:16.620]   Almost like...
[03:12:16.620 --> 03:12:18.620]   Yeah, as people are just kind of coming in and...
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:20.620]   Yeah, that. But also while
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:22.620]   it's a breakout discussion
[03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:24.620]   that happens for like seconds
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:26.620]   at a time, maybe an inside joke,
[03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:28.620]   or it's like this interesting
[03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:30.620]   dynamic that happens that Zoom...
[03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:32.620]   And you're bonding.
[03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:34.620]   You're bonding, but through that bonding
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:36.620]   you get the excitement. There's certain ideas
[03:12:36.620 --> 03:12:38.620]   that are like complete bullshit
[03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:40.620]   and you'll see that in the faces of others.
[03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:42.620]   That you won't see necessarily
[03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:44.620]   on Zoom.
[03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:46.620]   Something... It feels like
[03:12:46.620 --> 03:12:48.620]   that should be possible to do
[03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:50.620]   without being in person.
[03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:52.620]   Well, I mean, being in person is a very
[03:12:52.620 --> 03:12:54.620]   different thing. It's worth it.
[03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:56.620]   But you can't always do it.
[03:12:56.620 --> 03:12:58.620]   And so, again, we're still learning
[03:12:58.620 --> 03:13:00.620]   and we're all still learning
[03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:02.620]   humanity with this new reality, right?
[03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:04.620]   But what we found
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:06.620]   is that getting people together, whether it be
[03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.620]   a team or the whole company or whatever,
[03:13:08.620 --> 03:13:10.620]   is worth the expense because people
[03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:12.620]   work together and are happier
[03:13:12.620 --> 03:13:14.620]   after that. Like it just...
[03:13:14.620 --> 03:13:16.620]   There's a massive period of time where
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:18.620]   you go out and things start getting frayed,
[03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:20.620]   pull people together, and then you realize
[03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:22.620]   that we're all working together. We see things
[03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:24.620]   the same way. We work through the disagreement or the misunderstanding.
[03:13:24.620 --> 03:13:26.620]   We're talking across each other and then
[03:13:26.620 --> 03:13:28.620]   you work much better together. And so
[03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:30.620]   things like that I think are really quite important.
[03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:32.620]   What about people
[03:13:32.620 --> 03:13:34.620]   that are kind of specialized in very different
[03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:36.620]   aspects of the stack working together?
[03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:38.620]   What are some interesting challenges there?
[03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:40.620]   Yeah, well, so I mean, there's lots of interesting people
[03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:42.620]   as you can tell I'm, you know, hard to deal with too.
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:44.620]   You're one of the most lovable people.
[03:13:44.620 --> 03:13:46.620]   You're one of the most lovable people.
[03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:48.620]   So,
[03:13:48.620 --> 03:13:50.620]   one of the... So there's different philosophies
[03:13:50.620 --> 03:13:52.620]   in building teams. For me,
[03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:54.620]   and so some people say,
[03:13:54.620 --> 03:13:56.620]   "Hire 10x programmers," and that's the only thing
[03:13:56.620 --> 03:13:58.620]   whatever that means, right?
[03:13:58.620 --> 03:14:00.620]   What I believe in is building
[03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:02.620]   well-balanced teams.
[03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:04.620]   Teams that have people that are different
[03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:06.620]   in them. Like if you have all generals
[03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:08.620]   and no troops, or all troops
[03:14:08.620 --> 03:14:10.620]   and no generals, or you have all
[03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:12.620]   people that think in one way and not the other way,
[03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:14.620]   what you get is you get a very biased
[03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:16.620]   and skewed and weird situation where people
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:18.620]   end up being unhappy. And so what I like
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:20.620]   to do is I like to build teams of people
[03:14:20.620 --> 03:14:22.620]   where they're not all the same.
[03:14:22.620 --> 03:14:24.620]   You know, we do have teams that are focused
[03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:26.620]   on like runtime or compiler, GPU,
[03:14:26.620 --> 03:14:28.620]   or whatever the speciality
[03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:30.620]   is, but people bring a different take
[03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:32.620]   and have a different perspective.
[03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:34.620]   And I look for people that complement each other.
[03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:36.620]   And particularly if you look at leadership
[03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:38.620]   teams and things like this, you don't want
[03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:40.620]   everybody thinking the same way.
[03:14:40.620 --> 03:14:42.620]   You want people bringing different perspectives
[03:14:42.620 --> 03:14:44.620]   and experiences. And so I think that's really
[03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:46.620]   important. That's team, but what about
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:48.620]   building a company as ambitious
[03:14:48.620 --> 03:14:50.620]   as Modular? So what, uh,
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:52.620]   some interesting questions there?
[03:14:52.620 --> 03:14:54.620]   Oh, I mean, so many. Like, so, um,
[03:14:54.620 --> 03:14:56.620]   one of the things I love about,
[03:14:56.620 --> 03:14:58.620]   okay, so, Modular's the first company I built
[03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:00.620]   from scratch. Um,
[03:15:00.620 --> 03:15:02.620]   uh, one of
[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:04.620]   the first things that was profound
[03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:06.620]   was I'm not cleaning up somebody else's
[03:15:06.620 --> 03:15:08.620]   mess. Right? And so
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:10.620]   if you look at... And that's liberating to some
[03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:12.620]   degree. It's super liberating. And, um,
[03:15:12.620 --> 03:15:14.620]   and also, many
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:16.620]   of the projects I've built in the past
[03:15:16.620 --> 03:15:18.620]   have not been core to the product of the
[03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:20.620]   company. Swift
[03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:22.620]   is not Apple's product.
[03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:24.620]   Right? Uh, MLIR is not
[03:15:24.620 --> 03:15:26.620]   Google's revenue
[03:15:26.620 --> 03:15:28.620]   machine or whatever, right? It's not...
[03:15:28.620 --> 03:15:30.620]   It's important, but it's like
[03:15:30.620 --> 03:15:32.620]   working on the accounting software
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:34.620]   for, you know, the
[03:15:34.620 --> 03:15:36.620]   retail giant or something, right? It's
[03:15:36.620 --> 03:15:38.620]   like enabling infrastructure and
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:40.620]   technology. And so at Modular,
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:42.620]   the tech we're building is
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:44.620]   here to solve people's problems.
[03:15:44.620 --> 03:15:46.620]   Like, it is directly the thing that we're giving
[03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:48.620]   to people. And so this is a really
[03:15:48.620 --> 03:15:50.620]   big difference. And what it means for me
[03:15:50.620 --> 03:15:52.620]   as a leader, but also for many
[03:15:52.620 --> 03:15:54.620]   of our engineers, is they're working on the thing that matters.
[03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:56.620]   And that's actually pretty...
[03:15:56.620 --> 03:15:58.620]   I mean, again, for, for a compiler
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.620]   people and things like that, that's, that's usually not
[03:16:00.620 --> 03:16:02.620]   the case, right? And so that's, that's
[03:16:02.620 --> 03:16:04.620]   also pretty exciting and, and quite nice.
[03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:06.620]   But the, um,
[03:16:06.620 --> 03:16:08.620]   one of the ways that this
[03:16:08.620 --> 03:16:10.620]   manifests is it makes it easier to make decisions.
[03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:12.620]   And so one of the challenges I've had
[03:16:12.620 --> 03:16:14.620]   in other worlds is it's like, okay, well,
[03:16:14.620 --> 03:16:16.620]   community matters
[03:16:16.620 --> 03:16:18.620]   somehow for the goodness
[03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:20.620]   of the world, like, or open source
[03:16:20.620 --> 03:16:22.620]   matters, theoretically, but I don't want to pay
[03:16:22.620 --> 03:16:24.620]   for a t-shirt.
[03:16:24.620 --> 03:16:26.620]   Right? Or some swag. Like,
[03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:28.620]   well, t-shirts cost 10 bucks each,
[03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:30.620]   you can have 100 t-shirts for $1,000.
[03:16:30.620 --> 03:16:32.620]   To a mega corp, $1,000
[03:16:32.620 --> 03:16:34.620]   is uncountably...
[03:16:34.620 --> 03:16:36.620]   can't count that low.
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:38.620]   Right? But justifying it and getting
[03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:40.620]   a t-shirt... By the way, if you'd like a t-shirt,
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:42.620]   give me a t-shirt. I would 100%
[03:16:42.620 --> 03:16:44.620]   like a t-shirt. Are you
[03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:46.620]   joking? You can have a fire
[03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:48.620]   emoji t-shirt.
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:50.620]   I will, I will treasure this.
[03:16:50.620 --> 03:16:52.620]   Is that a good thing? I will pass it down to my
[03:16:52.620 --> 03:16:54.620]   grandchildren. And so, you know, it's, it's very
[03:16:54.620 --> 03:16:56.620]   liberating to be able to decide, I think that Lex should
[03:16:56.620 --> 03:16:58.620]   have a t-shirt.
[03:16:58.620 --> 03:17:00.620]   Right? And it becomes very simple
[03:17:00.620 --> 03:17:02.620]   because I like Lex.
[03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:04.620]   This, this, uh,
[03:17:04.620 --> 03:17:06.620]   this is awesome. Um,
[03:17:06.620 --> 03:17:08.620]   so...
[03:17:08.620 --> 03:17:10.620]   I have to ask
[03:17:10.620 --> 03:17:12.620]   you about the...
[03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:14.620]   One of the
[03:17:14.620 --> 03:17:16.620]   interesting developments with large language models
[03:17:16.620 --> 03:17:18.620]   is that they're
[03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:20.620]   able to generate
[03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:22.620]   code, uh, recently
[03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:24.620]   really well.
[03:17:24.620 --> 03:17:26.620]   Yes. To a degree that,
[03:17:26.620 --> 03:17:28.620]   uh, maybe, uh,
[03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:30.620]   I don't know if you understand, but I have,
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:32.620]   I struggle to understand because
[03:17:32.620 --> 03:17:34.620]   it forces me to ask questions
[03:17:34.620 --> 03:17:36.620]   about the nature of programming,
[03:17:36.620 --> 03:17:38.620]   of the nature of thought,
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:40.620]   because the, uh,
[03:17:40.620 --> 03:17:42.620]   language models are able to predict
[03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:44.620]   the kind of code I was about to write so well.
[03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:46.620]   Yep. That it makes me wonder,
[03:17:46.620 --> 03:17:48.620]   like, how unique my brain is, and
[03:17:48.620 --> 03:17:50.620]   where the valuable ideas actually come from.
[03:17:50.620 --> 03:17:52.620]   Like, how much do I contribute
[03:17:52.620 --> 03:17:54.620]   in terms of, uh,
[03:17:54.620 --> 03:17:56.620]   ingenuity, innovation
[03:17:56.620 --> 03:17:58.620]   to code I write,
[03:17:58.620 --> 03:18:00.620]   or design, and that kind of stuff.
[03:18:00.620 --> 03:18:02.620]   Um, when you stand on the shoulders
[03:18:02.620 --> 03:18:04.620]   of giants, are you really doing anything? And what
[03:18:04.620 --> 03:18:06.620]   LLMs are helping you do
[03:18:06.620 --> 03:18:08.620]   is they help you stand on the
[03:18:08.620 --> 03:18:10.620]   shoulders of giants in your program. There's
[03:18:10.620 --> 03:18:12.620]   mistakes, they're interesting that you learn
[03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:14.620]   from, but I just, it would love to
[03:18:14.620 --> 03:18:16.620]   get your opinion first, high level
[03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:18.620]   of what you think about, uh,
[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:20.620]   this impact of large language
[03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:22.620]   models when they do program synthesis,
[03:18:22.620 --> 03:18:24.620]   when they generate code.
[03:18:24.620 --> 03:18:26.620]   Yeah, well, so, um,
[03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:28.620]   I don't know where it all goes.
[03:18:28.620 --> 03:18:30.620]   Yeah. Um, I'm an optimist,
[03:18:30.620 --> 03:18:32.620]   and I'm a human optimist,
[03:18:32.620 --> 03:18:34.620]   right? I think that, um, things I've seen
[03:18:34.620 --> 03:18:36.620]   are that a lot of the LLMs are really good
[03:18:36.620 --> 03:18:38.620]   at crushing leet code projects,
[03:18:38.620 --> 03:18:40.620]   and they can reverse the linked list like crazy,
[03:18:40.620 --> 03:18:42.620]   um, well, it turns out there's a lot
[03:18:42.620 --> 03:18:44.620]   of instances of that
[03:18:44.620 --> 03:18:46.620]   on the internet, and it's a pretty stock thing,
[03:18:46.620 --> 03:18:48.620]   and so if you want to see
[03:18:48.620 --> 03:18:50.620]   standard questions answered, LLMs
[03:18:50.620 --> 03:18:52.620]   can memorize all the answers, and that can be amazing.
[03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:54.620]   And also they do generalize out
[03:18:54.620 --> 03:18:56.620]   from that, and so there's good work on that,
[03:18:56.620 --> 03:18:58.620]   but, um, but I think that
[03:18:58.620 --> 03:19:00.620]   if you, in my experience, building things,
[03:19:00.620 --> 03:19:02.620]   building something, like you talk
[03:19:02.620 --> 03:19:04.620]   about Mojo, or you talk about these things,
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:06.620]   or you talk about building an applied
[03:19:06.620 --> 03:19:08.620]   solution to a problem, it's also about
[03:19:08.620 --> 03:19:10.620]   working with people. It's about
[03:19:10.620 --> 03:19:12.620]   understanding the problem. What is the product that you want to build?
[03:19:12.620 --> 03:19:14.620]   What are the use cases? What are the customers?
[03:19:14.620 --> 03:19:16.620]   You can't just go survey all the customers
[03:19:16.620 --> 03:19:18.620]   because they'll tell you that they want a faster
[03:19:18.620 --> 03:19:20.620]   horse. Maybe they need a car.
[03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:22.620]   Right? And so a lot of it comes into,
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:24.620]   um, you know, I don't feel
[03:19:24.620 --> 03:19:26.620]   like we have to compete with LLMs. I think
[03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:28.620]   they'll help automate a ton of the mechanical stuff
[03:19:28.620 --> 03:19:30.620]   out of the way,
[03:19:30.620 --> 03:19:32.620]   and just like, you know, I think we all try to scale
[03:19:32.620 --> 03:19:34.620]   through delegation and things like this,
[03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:36.620]   delegating root things to an LLM
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:38.620]   I think is an extremely valuable
[03:19:38.620 --> 03:19:40.620]   approach that will help us
[03:19:40.620 --> 03:19:42.620]   all scale and be more productive.
[03:19:42.620 --> 03:19:44.620]   But I think it's a fascinating companion.
[03:19:44.620 --> 03:19:46.620]   But I'd say I don't think that means that we're
[03:19:46.620 --> 03:19:48.620]   going to be done with coding.
[03:19:48.620 --> 03:19:50.620]   But there's power
[03:19:50.620 --> 03:19:52.620]   in it as a companion.
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:54.620]   And from there, I could,
[03:19:54.620 --> 03:19:56.620]   I would love to zoom in on Mojo a little bit.
[03:19:56.620 --> 03:19:58.620]   Do you think, uh,
[03:19:58.620 --> 03:20:00.620]   do you think about that? Do you think about
[03:20:00.620 --> 03:20:02.620]   LLMs generating Mojo code?
[03:20:02.620 --> 03:20:04.620]   Uh, and helping sort of,
[03:20:04.620 --> 03:20:06.620]   like, when you design
[03:20:06.620 --> 03:20:08.620]   a new programming language, it almost seems like
[03:20:08.620 --> 03:20:10.620]   man, it would be nice to this thing.
[03:20:10.620 --> 03:20:12.620]   Sort of, um,
[03:20:12.620 --> 03:20:14.620]   almost as a way to learn
[03:20:14.620 --> 03:20:16.620]   how I'm supposed to use this thing
[03:20:16.620 --> 03:20:18.620]   for them to be trained on
[03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:20.620]   some of the Mojo code. Yeah.
[03:20:20.620 --> 03:20:22.620]   So I do lead an AI company, so maybe
[03:20:22.620 --> 03:20:24.620]   there will be a Mojo LLM at some point.
[03:20:24.620 --> 03:20:26.620]   Uh, but if your
[03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:28.620]   question is like, how do we make a language
[03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:30.620]   to be suitable for LLMs?
[03:20:30.620 --> 03:20:32.620]   Yeah. I think that the, um,
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:34.620]   I think the cool thing about LLMs
[03:20:34.620 --> 03:20:36.620]   is you don't have to.
[03:20:36.620 --> 03:20:38.620]   Right? And so if you look at,
[03:20:38.620 --> 03:20:40.620]   what is English, or any of these other terrible
[03:20:40.620 --> 03:20:42.620]   languages that we as humans deal with on a
[03:20:42.620 --> 03:20:44.620]   continuous basis, they're never designed for machines.
[03:20:44.620 --> 03:20:46.620]   And yet, they're
[03:20:46.620 --> 03:20:48.620]   the intermediate representation. They're
[03:20:48.620 --> 03:20:50.620]   the exchange format that we humans use
[03:20:50.620 --> 03:20:52.620]   to get stuff done. Right?
[03:20:52.620 --> 03:20:54.620]   And so these programming languages, they're an
[03:20:54.620 --> 03:20:56.620]   intermediate representation between
[03:20:56.620 --> 03:20:58.620]   the human and the computer. Or, the human and the compiler.
[03:20:58.620 --> 03:21:00.620]   Roughly. Right?
[03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:02.620]   And so, I think the LLMs will have
[03:21:02.620 --> 03:21:04.620]   no problem learning whatever
[03:21:04.620 --> 03:21:06.620]   keyword we pick. Maybe the phi emoji
[03:21:06.620 --> 03:21:08.620]   is gonna be critical. Oh, maybe that's gonna break it?
[03:21:08.620 --> 03:21:10.620]   It doesn't tokenize? No, the, uh,
[03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:12.620]   reverse of that, it will actually enable it. Because
[03:21:12.620 --> 03:21:14.620]   one of the issues I could see with
[03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:16.620]   being a superset of Python,
[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:18.620]   is there would be confusion about the gray area.
[03:21:18.620 --> 03:21:20.620]   So it would be mixing stuff.
[03:21:20.620 --> 03:21:22.620]   Uh,
[03:21:22.620 --> 03:21:24.620]   but... Well, I'm a human optimist, and I'm also
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:26.620]   an LLM optimist. I think that we'll solve that problem.
[03:21:26.620 --> 03:21:28.620]   We'll solve it, yeah. But the, uh,
[03:21:28.620 --> 03:21:30.620]   um, but you look at that and you
[03:21:30.620 --> 03:21:32.620]   say, okay, well,
[03:21:32.620 --> 03:21:34.620]   reducing the rote thing, right?
[03:21:34.620 --> 03:21:36.620]   Turns out compilers are very particular, and
[03:21:36.620 --> 03:21:38.620]   they really want things, they really want the
[03:21:38.620 --> 03:21:40.620]   indentation to be right. They really want the colon to be there.
[03:21:40.620 --> 03:21:42.620]   On your else or else it'll complain.
[03:21:42.620 --> 03:21:44.620]   Right? I mean, compilers can do better
[03:21:44.620 --> 03:21:46.620]   at this, but, um,
[03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:48.620]   LLMs can totally help solve that problem.
[03:21:48.620 --> 03:21:50.620]   So I'm very happy about the new, uh,
[03:21:50.620 --> 03:21:52.620]   predictive coding and copilot type
[03:21:52.620 --> 03:21:54.620]   features and things like this, because I think it'll all just
[03:21:54.620 --> 03:21:56.620]   make us more productive. It's still messy
[03:21:56.620 --> 03:21:58.620]   and fuzzy and uncertain,
[03:21:58.620 --> 03:22:00.620]   unpredictable, so... But is
[03:22:00.620 --> 03:22:02.620]   there a future you see, given how big
[03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:04.620]   of a leap GPT-4 was?
[03:22:04.620 --> 03:22:06.620]   Where you start to see
[03:22:06.620 --> 03:22:08.620]   something like LLMs inside
[03:22:08.620 --> 03:22:10.620]   a compiler?
[03:22:10.620 --> 03:22:12.620]   Or no? Uh, I mean, you could do that.
[03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:14.620]   Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that would be interesting.
[03:22:14.620 --> 03:22:16.620]   Is that wise?
[03:22:16.620 --> 03:22:18.620]   Well, I mean, it would be very expensive.
[03:22:18.620 --> 03:22:20.620]   So, compilers run
[03:22:20.620 --> 03:22:22.620]   fast and they're very efficient, and LLMs are
[03:22:22.620 --> 03:22:24.620]   currently very expensive. There's on-device
[03:22:24.620 --> 03:22:26.620]   LLMs and there's other things going on, and so
[03:22:26.620 --> 03:22:28.620]   maybe there's an answer there.
[03:22:28.620 --> 03:22:30.620]   Um, I think that one of the things that I haven't
[03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:32.620]   seen enough of is that
[03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:34.620]   so LLMs to me are
[03:22:34.620 --> 03:22:36.620]   amazing when you tap into the creative
[03:22:36.620 --> 03:22:38.620]   potential of the
[03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:40.620]   hallucinations, right? And so
[03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:42.620]   if you're doing creative
[03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:44.620]   brainstorming or creative writing or things like that,
[03:22:44.620 --> 03:22:46.620]   the hallucinations work in your favor.
[03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:48.620]   Um,
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:50.620]   if you're writing code that has to be correct because you're gonna ship it
[03:22:50.620 --> 03:22:52.620]   in production, then maybe that's not actually a feature.
[03:22:52.620 --> 03:22:54.620]   And so
[03:22:54.620 --> 03:22:56.620]   I think that there has been research
[03:22:56.620 --> 03:22:58.620]   and there has been work on building
[03:22:58.620 --> 03:23:00.620]   algebraic reasoning systems
[03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:02.620]   and kind of like figuring out
[03:23:02.620 --> 03:23:04.620]   more things that feel like proofs.
[03:23:04.620 --> 03:23:06.620]   And so I think that there could be interesting
[03:23:06.620 --> 03:23:08.620]   work in terms of building more
[03:23:08.620 --> 03:23:10.620]   reliable at scale systems, and that could be
[03:23:10.620 --> 03:23:12.620]   interesting. But if you chase that
[03:23:12.620 --> 03:23:14.620]   rabbit hole down, the question then becomes
[03:23:14.620 --> 03:23:16.620]   how do you express your intent to the machine?
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:18.620]   And so maybe you want an LLM to provide the spec,
[03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:20.620]   but you have a different
[03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:22.620]   kind of net that then actually
[03:23:22.620 --> 03:23:24.620]   implements the code. Right, so it's
[03:23:24.620 --> 03:23:26.620]   to use the documentation and
[03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:28.620]   inspiration versus the
[03:23:28.620 --> 03:23:30.620]   actual implementation.
[03:23:30.620 --> 03:23:32.620]   Yeah, potentially.
[03:23:32.620 --> 03:23:34.620]   Since a successful
[03:23:34.620 --> 03:23:36.620]   modular will be the thing that runs
[03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:38.620]   I say so
[03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:40.620]   jokingly, our AI overlords,
[03:23:40.620 --> 03:23:42.620]   but AI systems that are
[03:23:42.620 --> 03:23:44.620]   used across
[03:23:44.620 --> 03:23:46.620]   I know it's a cliche term, but
[03:23:46.620 --> 03:23:48.620]   Internet of Things, so across
[03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:50.620]   So I'll joke and say like AGI
[03:23:50.620 --> 03:23:52.620]   should be written in Mojo. Yeah.
[03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:54.620]   AGI should be written in Mojo. You're
[03:23:54.620 --> 03:23:56.620]   joking, but it's also possible that it's not
[03:23:56.620 --> 03:23:58.620]   a joke.
[03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:00.620]   That a lot of the ideas behind Mojo
[03:24:00.620 --> 03:24:02.620]   seems like the
[03:24:02.620 --> 03:24:04.620]   natural set of ideas that
[03:24:04.620 --> 03:24:06.620]   would enable at scale
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:08.620]   training and inference of
[03:24:08.620 --> 03:24:10.620]   AI systems.
[03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:12.620]   So I just have to ask you about the big
[03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:14.620]   philosophical question about human civilization.
[03:24:14.620 --> 03:24:16.620]   So folks like
[03:24:16.620 --> 03:24:18.620]   Eliezer Yudkowsky are really concerned about
[03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:20.620]   the threat of AI.
[03:24:20.620 --> 03:24:22.620]   Do you think about
[03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:24.620]   the good
[03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:26.620]   and the bad that can happen
[03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:28.620]   at scale deployment of
[03:24:28.620 --> 03:24:30.620]   AI systems? Well, so I've
[03:24:30.620 --> 03:24:32.620]   thought a lot about it, and there's a lot of different
[03:24:32.620 --> 03:24:34.620]   parts to this problem, everything from
[03:24:34.620 --> 03:24:36.620]   job displacement to
[03:24:36.620 --> 03:24:38.620]   Skynet, things like this.
[03:24:38.620 --> 03:24:40.620]   And so you can zoom into subparts of this problem.
[03:24:40.620 --> 03:24:44.620]   I'm not super
[03:24:44.620 --> 03:24:46.620]   optimistic about AGI being
[03:24:46.620 --> 03:24:48.620]   solved next year.
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:50.620]   I don't think that's going to happen personally.
[03:24:50.620 --> 03:24:52.620]   So you have a kind of Zen-like
[03:24:52.620 --> 03:24:54.620]   calm about... There's a
[03:24:54.620 --> 03:24:56.620]   nervousness because the leap of GPT-4
[03:24:56.620 --> 03:24:58.620]   seemed so big.
[03:24:58.620 --> 03:25:00.620]   Sure. It's huge.
[03:25:00.620 --> 03:25:02.620]   It's like we're almost... There's
[03:25:02.620 --> 03:25:04.620]   some kind of transitionary period. You're thinking...
[03:25:04.620 --> 03:25:06.620]   Well, so I mean
[03:25:06.620 --> 03:25:08.620]   there's a couple of things going on there. One is
[03:25:08.620 --> 03:25:10.620]   I'm sure GPT-5 and 7
[03:25:10.620 --> 03:25:12.620]   and 19 will be also huge leaps.
[03:25:12.620 --> 03:25:14.620]   They're also getting much more expensive
[03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:16.620]   to run. And so there
[03:25:16.620 --> 03:25:18.620]   may be a limiting function in terms of just expense
[03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:20.620]   on the one hand, and train.
[03:25:20.620 --> 03:25:22.620]   That could be a limiter that slows things down.
[03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:24.620]   But I think the bigger limiter
[03:25:24.620 --> 03:25:26.620]   is outside of
[03:25:26.620 --> 03:25:28.620]   Skynet takes over and...
[03:25:28.620 --> 03:25:30.620]   I don't spend any time thinking about that because if Skynet takes
[03:25:30.620 --> 03:25:32.620]   over and kills us all, then I'll be dead. So I don't worry
[03:25:32.620 --> 03:25:34.620]   about that.
[03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:36.620]   I mean, that's just...
[03:25:36.620 --> 03:25:38.620]   Other things to worry about, I'll just focus on.
[03:25:38.620 --> 03:25:40.620]   I'll focus and not worry about that one.
[03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:42.620]   But I think that the
[03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:44.620]   other thing I'd say is that
[03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:46.620]   AI moves quickly, but humans
[03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:48.620]   move slowly. And we adapt slowly.
[03:25:48.620 --> 03:25:50.620]   And so what I expect to happen is
[03:25:50.620 --> 03:25:52.620]   just like any technology diffusion,
[03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:54.620]   like the promise
[03:25:54.620 --> 03:25:56.620]   and then the application
[03:25:56.620 --> 03:25:58.620]   takes time to roll out.
[03:25:58.620 --> 03:26:00.620]   And so I think that I'm not even too
[03:26:00.620 --> 03:26:02.620]   worried about autonomous cars
[03:26:02.620 --> 03:26:04.620]   defining away all the taxi drivers.
[03:26:04.620 --> 03:26:06.620]   Remember, autonomy was supposed to be solved by 2020?
[03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:08.620]   Yeah, boy do I remember.
[03:26:08.620 --> 03:26:10.620]   So, and so
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:12.620]   I think that on the one hand we can
[03:26:12.620 --> 03:26:14.620]   see amazing progress, but on the other
[03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:16.620]   hand we can see that
[03:26:16.620 --> 03:26:18.620]   reality is a little bit more complicated
[03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:20.620]   and it may take longer to roll out
[03:26:20.620 --> 03:26:22.620]   than you might expect.
[03:26:22.620 --> 03:26:24.620]   Well that's in the physical space. I do think in the digital
[03:26:24.620 --> 03:26:26.620]   space is the stuff
[03:26:26.620 --> 03:26:28.620]   that's built on top of LLMs
[03:26:28.620 --> 03:26:30.620]   that runs
[03:26:30.620 --> 03:26:32.620]   the millions of apps that can be built on
[03:26:32.620 --> 03:26:34.620]   top of them and that could be
[03:26:34.620 --> 03:26:36.620]   run on millions of devices, millions of
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:38.620]   types of devices.
[03:26:38.620 --> 03:26:40.620]   I just think
[03:26:40.620 --> 03:26:42.620]   that the rapid
[03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:44.620]   effect it has on human civilization
[03:26:44.620 --> 03:26:46.620]   could be
[03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:48.620]   truly transformative to it.
[03:26:48.620 --> 03:26:50.620]   Well, and so
[03:26:50.620 --> 03:26:52.620]   and there I think it depends on are you an optimist
[03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:54.620]   or a pessimist or a masochist.
[03:26:54.620 --> 03:26:56.620]   Just to clarify,
[03:26:56.620 --> 03:26:58.620]   optimist
[03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:00.620]   about human civilization.
[03:27:00.620 --> 03:27:02.620]   Me too. And so I look at that as saying
[03:27:02.620 --> 03:27:04.620]   okay cool, well yeah I do.
[03:27:04.620 --> 03:27:06.620]   And so some people say oh my god it's going to
[03:27:06.620 --> 03:27:08.620]   destroy us all, how do we prevent that?
[03:27:08.620 --> 03:27:10.620]   I kind of look at it from a
[03:27:10.620 --> 03:27:12.620]   is it going to unlock us all?
[03:27:12.620 --> 03:27:14.620]   Right, you talk about coding, is it going to make so I don't have to
[03:27:14.620 --> 03:27:16.620]   do all the repetitive stuff?
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:18.620]   Well suddenly that's a very optimistic way to look
[03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:20.620]   at it and you look at what a lot of
[03:27:20.620 --> 03:27:22.620]   these technologies have done
[03:27:22.620 --> 03:27:24.620]   to improve our lives and I want
[03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:26.620]   that to go faster.
[03:27:26.620 --> 03:27:28.620]   What do you think the future of programming
[03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:30.620]   looks like in the next 10, 20, 30,
[03:27:30.620 --> 03:27:32.620]   50 years? With LLMs
[03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:34.620]   and
[03:27:34.620 --> 03:27:36.620]   with Mojo,
[03:27:36.620 --> 03:27:38.620]   with modular, like your vision
[03:27:38.620 --> 03:27:40.620]   for devices, the hardware,
[03:27:40.620 --> 03:27:42.620]   to the compilers, to the
[03:27:42.620 --> 03:27:44.620]   different stacks of software.
[03:27:44.620 --> 03:27:46.620]   Well so what I want, I mean coming back to my
[03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:48.620]   arch nemesis, it's complexity.
[03:27:48.620 --> 03:27:50.620]   So again, me being
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:52.620]   the optimist, if we drive
[03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:54.620]   down complexity, we can make
[03:27:54.620 --> 03:27:56.620]   these tools, these technologies, these
[03:27:56.620 --> 03:27:58.620]   cool hardware widgets accessible to
[03:27:58.620 --> 03:28:00.620]   way more people. And so what I'd love to see
[03:28:00.620 --> 03:28:02.620]   is more personalized experiences,
[03:28:02.620 --> 03:28:04.620]   more things, the research
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:06.620]   getting into production instead of being lost
[03:28:06.620 --> 03:28:08.620]   at NeurIPS.
[03:28:08.620 --> 03:28:10.620]   And so like the
[03:28:10.620 --> 03:28:12.620]   these things that impact people's
[03:28:12.620 --> 03:28:14.620]   lives by entering products.
[03:28:14.620 --> 03:28:16.620]   And so one of the things that I'm a little
[03:28:16.620 --> 03:28:18.620]   bit concerned about is right now
[03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:20.620]   the big companies are
[03:28:20.620 --> 03:28:22.620]   investing huge amounts of money and are driving
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:24.620]   the top line of AI capability forward
[03:28:24.620 --> 03:28:26.620]   really quickly. But if
[03:28:26.620 --> 03:28:28.620]   it means that you have to have a hundred million dollars
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:30.620]   to train a model or more,
[03:28:30.620 --> 03:28:32.620]   a hundred billion dollars, right, well that's
[03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:34.620]   gonna make it very concentrated
[03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:36.620]   with very few people
[03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:38.620]   in the world that can actually do this stuff.
[03:28:38.620 --> 03:28:40.620]   I'd much rather see
[03:28:40.620 --> 03:28:42.620]   lots of people across the industry
[03:28:42.620 --> 03:28:44.620]   be able to participate and use this.
[03:28:44.620 --> 03:28:46.620]   When you look at this, you know, I mean
[03:28:46.620 --> 03:28:48.620]   a lot of great research has been done
[03:28:48.620 --> 03:28:50.620]   in the health world, looking at
[03:28:50.620 --> 03:28:52.620]   like detecting pathologies
[03:28:52.620 --> 03:28:54.620]   and doing radiology with AI
[03:28:54.620 --> 03:28:56.620]   and like doing all these things.
[03:28:56.620 --> 03:28:58.620]   Well, the problem today is that to
[03:28:58.620 --> 03:29:00.620]   deploy and build these systems you have to be an expert in
[03:29:00.620 --> 03:29:02.620]   radiology and an expert in
[03:29:02.620 --> 03:29:04.620]   AI. And if we
[03:29:04.620 --> 03:29:06.620]   can break down the barriers so
[03:29:06.620 --> 03:29:08.620]   that more people can use AI techniques,
[03:29:08.620 --> 03:29:10.620]   and it's more like programming Python,
[03:29:10.620 --> 03:29:12.620]   which
[03:29:12.620 --> 03:29:14.620]   roughly everybody can do if they want to,
[03:29:14.620 --> 03:29:16.620]   right, then I think that we'll get a lot more
[03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:18.620]   practical application of these techniques and a
[03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:20.620]   lot more nichier,
[03:29:20.620 --> 03:29:22.620]   cool, but narrower demands. And I think
[03:29:22.620 --> 03:29:24.620]   that's gonna be really cool.
[03:29:24.620 --> 03:29:26.620]   Do you think we'll have more or less programmers
[03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:28.620]   in the world than now?
[03:29:28.620 --> 03:29:30.620]   Well, so I think we'll have more
[03:29:30.620 --> 03:29:32.620]   programmers, but they may not consider themselves
[03:29:32.620 --> 03:29:34.620]   to be programmers. That'd be a different name
[03:29:34.620 --> 03:29:36.620]   for it. Right, I mean, do you consider somebody that uses
[03:29:36.620 --> 03:29:38.620]   you know, I think that arguably the most
[03:29:38.620 --> 03:29:40.620]   popular programming language
[03:29:40.620 --> 03:29:42.620]   is Excel.
[03:29:42.620 --> 03:29:44.620]   Yeah. Right?
[03:29:44.620 --> 03:29:46.620]   Yep. And so do they consider themselves to be
[03:29:46.620 --> 03:29:48.620]   programmers? Maybe not. I mean, some
[03:29:48.620 --> 03:29:50.620]   of them make crazy macros and stuff
[03:29:50.620 --> 03:29:52.620]   like that, but
[03:29:52.620 --> 03:29:54.620]   what
[03:29:54.620 --> 03:29:56.620]   you mentioned, Steve Jobs, is it's the
[03:29:56.620 --> 03:29:58.620]   bicycle for the mind
[03:29:58.620 --> 03:30:00.620]   that allows you to go faster, right?
[03:30:00.620 --> 03:30:02.620]   And so I think that as we look
[03:30:02.620 --> 03:30:04.620]   forward, right, what is AI? I look at it as
[03:30:04.620 --> 03:30:06.620]   hopefully a new programming paradigm.
[03:30:06.620 --> 03:30:08.620]   It's like object-oriented programming.
[03:30:08.620 --> 03:30:10.620]   Right, if you want to write a cat detector, you
[03:30:10.620 --> 03:30:12.620]   don't use for loops.
[03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:14.620]   Turns out that's not the right tool for the job, right?
[03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:16.620]   And so right now, unfortunately,
[03:30:16.620 --> 03:30:18.620]   because, I mean, it's not unfortunate, but it's
[03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:20.620]   just kind of where things are, AI is this
[03:30:20.620 --> 03:30:22.620]   weird, different thing
[03:30:22.620 --> 03:30:24.620]   that's not integrated into programming
[03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:26.620]   languages and normal tool chains and all the technology
[03:30:26.620 --> 03:30:28.620]   is really weird and doesn't
[03:30:28.620 --> 03:30:30.620]   work right and you have to babysit it and
[03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:32.620]   every time you switch to hardware it's different.
[03:30:32.620 --> 03:30:34.620]   It shouldn't be that way!
[03:30:34.620 --> 03:30:36.620]   When you change that, when you fix that, suddenly
[03:30:36.620 --> 03:30:38.620]   again, the tools and technologies can be way easier
[03:30:38.620 --> 03:30:40.620]   to use. You can start using them for many more
[03:30:40.620 --> 03:30:42.620]   things. And so that's why I would be excited
[03:30:42.620 --> 03:30:44.620]   about it. What kind of advice could
[03:30:44.620 --> 03:30:46.620]   you give to somebody in high school right now or
[03:30:46.620 --> 03:30:48.620]   maybe early college who's
[03:30:48.620 --> 03:30:50.620]   curious about programming
[03:30:50.620 --> 03:30:52.620]   and feeling
[03:30:52.620 --> 03:30:54.620]   like the world is changing really
[03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:56.620]   quickly here? Yeah, well...
[03:30:56.620 --> 03:30:58.620]   What kind of stuff to learn, what kind of stuff to work
[03:30:58.620 --> 03:31:00.620]   on? Should they finish
[03:31:00.620 --> 03:31:02.620]   college? Should they go work
[03:31:02.620 --> 03:31:04.620]   at a company? Should they build a thing?
[03:31:04.620 --> 03:31:06.620]   What do you think? Well, so, I mean, one of the things
[03:31:06.620 --> 03:31:08.620]   I'd say is that
[03:31:08.620 --> 03:31:10.620]   you'll be most successful if you work on something you're
[03:31:10.620 --> 03:31:12.620]   excited by. And so
[03:31:12.620 --> 03:31:14.620]   don't get the book and read the book
[03:31:14.620 --> 03:31:16.620]   cover to cover and study
[03:31:16.620 --> 03:31:18.620]   and memorize and recite and flashcard and
[03:31:18.620 --> 03:31:20.620]   go build something. Like,
[03:31:20.620 --> 03:31:22.620]   go solve a problem. Go build the thing that you want
[03:31:22.620 --> 03:31:24.620]   to exist. Go build an app. Go
[03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:26.620]   build... train a model.
[03:31:26.620 --> 03:31:28.620]   Like, go build something and actually use it
[03:31:28.620 --> 03:31:30.620]   and set a goal for yourself. And if you do that, then
[03:31:30.620 --> 03:31:32.620]   you'll... you know, there's
[03:31:32.620 --> 03:31:34.620]   a success, there's the adrenaline rush, there's
[03:31:34.620 --> 03:31:36.620]   the achievement, there's the unlock that
[03:31:36.620 --> 03:31:38.620]   I think is where, you know, if you keep setting
[03:31:38.620 --> 03:31:40.620]   goals and you keep doing things and building
[03:31:40.620 --> 03:31:42.620]   things, learning by building is really powerful.
[03:31:42.620 --> 03:31:44.620]   In terms of career
[03:31:44.620 --> 03:31:46.620]   advice, I mean, everybody's different. It's
[03:31:46.620 --> 03:31:48.620]   very hard to give generalized advice.
[03:31:48.620 --> 03:31:50.620]   I'll speak as,
[03:31:50.620 --> 03:31:52.620]   you know, a compiler nerd.
[03:31:52.620 --> 03:31:54.620]   If everybody's going
[03:31:54.620 --> 03:31:56.620]   left, sometimes it's pretty cool
[03:31:56.620 --> 03:31:58.620]   to go right. And so just
[03:31:58.620 --> 03:32:00.620]   because everybody's doing a thing, it doesn't mean
[03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:02.620]   you have to do the same
[03:32:02.620 --> 03:32:04.620]   thing and follow the herd. In fact, I think
[03:32:04.620 --> 03:32:06.620]   that sometimes the most
[03:32:06.620 --> 03:32:08.620]   exciting paths through life lead
[03:32:08.620 --> 03:32:10.620]   to being curious about
[03:32:10.620 --> 03:32:12.620]   things that nobody else actually focuses
[03:32:12.620 --> 03:32:14.620]   on, right? And it turns out
[03:32:14.620 --> 03:32:16.620]   that understanding deeply
[03:32:16.620 --> 03:32:18.620]   parts of the problem that people want
[03:32:18.620 --> 03:32:20.620]   to take for granted makes you extremely
[03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:22.620]   valuable and specialized in ways
[03:32:22.620 --> 03:32:24.620]   that the herd is not.
[03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:26.620]   And so, again, I mean, there's lots of rooms
[03:32:26.620 --> 03:32:28.620]   for specialization, lots of rooms for
[03:32:28.620 --> 03:32:30.620]   generalists, there's lots of room for different
[03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:32.620]   kinds and parts of the problem, but
[03:32:32.620 --> 03:32:34.620]   I think that it's, you know, just
[03:32:34.620 --> 03:32:36.620]   because everybody's doing one thing doesn't mean
[03:32:36.620 --> 03:32:38.620]   you should necessarily do it.
[03:32:38.620 --> 03:32:40.620]   And now the herd is using Python, so
[03:32:40.620 --> 03:32:42.620]   if you want to be a rebel,
[03:32:42.620 --> 03:32:44.620]   go check out Mojo
[03:32:44.620 --> 03:32:46.620]   and help
[03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:48.620]   Chris and the rest of the world fight the
[03:32:48.620 --> 03:32:50.620]   arch-nemesis of complexity, because
[03:32:50.620 --> 03:32:52.620]   simple is beautiful. There you go.
[03:32:52.620 --> 03:32:54.620]   Chris, you're an incredible person. You've
[03:32:54.620 --> 03:32:56.620]   been so kind to me ever since we met.
[03:32:56.620 --> 03:32:58.620]   You've been extremely supportive. I'm
[03:32:58.620 --> 03:33:00.620]   forever grateful for that. Thank you for being
[03:33:00.620 --> 03:33:02.620]   who you are, for being legit,
[03:33:02.620 --> 03:33:04.620]   for being kind, for fighting this
[03:33:04.620 --> 03:33:08.620]   really interesting problem
[03:33:08.620 --> 03:33:10.620]   of how to make AI accessible
[03:33:10.620 --> 03:33:12.620]   to a huge number of people, huge number
[03:33:12.620 --> 03:33:14.620]   of devices. Yeah, well, so, Lex,
[03:33:14.620 --> 03:33:16.620]   you're a pretty special person, too, right?
[03:33:16.620 --> 03:33:18.620]   And so, I think that, you know,
[03:33:18.620 --> 03:33:20.620]   one of the funny things about you is that
[03:33:20.620 --> 03:33:22.620]   besides being curious and pretty damn smart,
[03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:24.620]   you're actually willing to push on things,
[03:33:24.620 --> 03:33:26.620]   and you're, I think that you've got
[03:33:26.620 --> 03:33:28.620]   an agenda to, like, make the world think,
[03:33:28.620 --> 03:33:30.620]   which I think is a pretty good agenda.
[03:33:30.620 --> 03:33:32.620]   It's a pretty good one.
[03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:34.620]   Thank you so much for talking to me, Chris. Yeah.
[03:33:34.620 --> 03:33:36.620]   Thanks, Lex.
[03:33:36.620 --> 03:33:38.620]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Ladner.

[03:33:44.620 --> 03:33:46.620]   from Isaac Asimov.
[03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:48.620]   "I do not fear computers.
[03:33:48.620 --> 03:33:50.620]   I fear the lack of them."
[03:33:50.620 --> 03:33:52.620]   Thank you for listening,
[03:33:52.620 --> 03:33:54.620]   and hope to see you next time.
