[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   We need it.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   We need it. So modular we're really tackling the AI infrastructure landscape and the big problems in AI and the reasons that is so difficult to use and scale and adopt and deploy and like all these big problems in AI and so we're coming out from that perspective now when you do that when you start tackling these problems you realize that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and so while we're doing this we're building mojo to be a fully general programming language and that means that
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   That means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and so while we're doing this we're building mojo to be a fully general programming language and that means that
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   That means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and so while we're doing this we're building mojo to be a fully general programming language and that means that
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:08:17.380]   and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   by having one thing so you mentioned modular mojo is the programming language modular is the whole software stack so just over a year ago we started this company called modular yeah okay what modular is about is about taking AI and up leveling it into the next generation right and so if you take a step back what's gone on in the last five six seven eight years is that we've had things like tensorflow and pytorch and these other systems come in you've used them you know this and what's happened
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI specific solution and that means that the solution to these other systems come in you've used them you know this and what's happened
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:09:17.420]   like crazy and they get tons of users in production deployment scenarios it's being used to power so many systems and AI is all around us now now it used to be controversial years ago but now it's a thing but the challenge of these systems is that they haven't always been thought out with current demands in mind so you think about it when where were LLM eight years ago well they didn't exist right AI has changed so much and a lot of what people are doing is
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:47.440]   that's what they're doing is they're building a system where they can't just use a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:10:17.460]  ,
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:17.460]   a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot of these systems and they're not really using a lot

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:26.820]   didnt get it I'm yuard 5 Yes, I think something about the usability and the ecosystem makes the thing viral and it grows and it's a virtuous cycle.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:45.280]   Well, there's many things that went into that, like I said, I think that ML was very good for Python, and so I think that Ken Sloan, PyTorch and these systems embracing Python really took and helped Python grow. But I think that the major thing underlying it is that Python is like the universal connector. Right? It really helps bring together lots of different systems so you can complete different systems and you can do the same thing over and over again.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:56.360]   hear
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:51.040]   out
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.700]   I the was 12
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:35.640]   right.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   So you don't you know, it's actually really nice to not have to fight it.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   It's actually really nice to not have to fight it.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   Right.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   Right.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   Right. And so you don't you know, it's actually really nice to not have to fight it.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:15:07.640]  , And then what you can see is the editors telling you how your code will work by indenting it, which I think is pretty cool.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:07.680]   I honestly don't think I've ever I don't remember having an error in Python because I indented stuff wrong.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:07.760]   So, I mean, I think that there's again, this is a religious thing.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:07.840]   And so I can joke about it and I love I love to kind of, you know, I realized that this is such a polarizing thing and everyone wants to argue about it.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:07.880]   I don't remember having an error in Python because I indented stuff wrong.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:07.920]   So I mean, I think that there's again, this is a religious thing.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:07.960]   And so I can joke about it and I love I love to kind of, you know, I realize that this is such a polarizing thing and everyone wants to argue about it.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.000]   And so I like poking at the bear a little bit.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.080]   And so I like poking at the bear a little bit.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.560]   Right. Come back to the first point.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   Python one.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   Like, it's huge.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.120]   It's an A.I.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.560]   It's the right thing for us.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.000]   Like we see Mojo as being an incredible part of the Python ecosystem.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.200]   We're not looking to break Python or change it or quote unquote fix it.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.280]   We love Python for it is our view is that Python is just not done yet.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.680]   And so if you look at, you know, you mentioned Python being slow.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.880]   Well, there's a couple of different things that go into that, which we can talk about if you want.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.440]   But one of them is it just doesn't have those features that you would use to do see like program.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:16:07.000]  ,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   think
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.560]   I-
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   and
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   and
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   and
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   and
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   and and
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   and and
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.260]   and and
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:42.200]   sound
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:58.700]   landmark.

[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:26.300]   ado a variety of reasons, anyways, I'm sure, right? I've written enough the way they show love. I have written enough C++ code to earn a little bit of grumpiness with C++. But, one of the problems with it is that the metaprogramming system templates is just a completely different universe from the normal runtime programming world. And so, if you do metaprogramming and programming, it's just like a different universe, different syntax, different concepts, different stuff going on. And so, again, one of our
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   One of our goals with Mojo is to make things really easy to use.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:54.820]  , easy to learn.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   And so there's a natural stepping stone.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   And so as you do this, you say, okay, well, I have to do programming at runtime.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.320]   After you're programming at compile time.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   Why are these different things?
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   How hard is that to pull out because that sounds to me as a fan of metaprogramming in C++ even how hard is it to pull that off that sounds really really really exciting because you can do the same style programming at compile time and at runtime that's really really really exciting.

[00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:12.480]  ,,,, do set was Hus Mr
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.340]   good
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:41.520]   imagine. I just,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:52.300]   in
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.480]  ; ,,, la
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:21.420]  uating to be able to do this. So, if you reduce the latency of a model so that it runs faster, so every time you query the server running the model it takes less time, well then the product team can go and make the model bigger. Well that actually makes it so you have a better experience as a customer, and so a lot of people care about that.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:27.580]   So, for auto tuning, for like tile size, you mentioned 128 for TPUs, you would specify like a bunch of options to try?
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.040]   In the code?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.540]   Yup.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.800]   Just a simple statement?
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.300]   Yup.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   And then you just set and forget and know?
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.860]   Yup.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:33.860]   Depending wherever it compiles, it'll actually be in the code.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.200]   Depending wherever it compiles, it'll actually be in the code?
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:27:03.760]  , and the beauty of this is that it helps you in a whole bunch of different ways, right? So if you're building, so often what'll happen is that you've written a bunch of software yourself, right?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.340]   You wake up one day, you say I have an idea, I'm going to go code up some code, I get to work, I forget about it, I move on with life, I come back six months or a year or two years or three years later, you dust it off and you go use it again in a new environment.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:04.340]  , and maybe your GPU is different. Maybe you're running on a server instead of a laptop, maybe whatever, right?
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:12.760]   And so the problem now is you say, okay, well, I mean, again, not everybody cares about performance, but if you do, you say, okay, well, I want to take advantage of all these new features.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.800]   I don't want to break the old thing though, right?
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:30.240]   And so the typical way of handling this kind of stuff before is, you know, if you're talking about templates or you're talking about C with macros, you end up with if-desks, you get like all these weird things get layered in, make the code super complicated, and then how do you test it?
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.080]   Right?
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.200]   Because this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   It becomes this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   It becomes this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   it becomes this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   it becomes this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   it becomes this crazy complexity, multidimensional space
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:28:04.200]  , and that just doesn't scale very well.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   Actually, let me just jump around before I go to some specific features, like the increase in performance here that we're talking about can be just insane. You're right that Mojo can provide a 35,000x speedup over Python. How does it do that?
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   Yeah, so you can even do more, but we'll get to that.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.220]   Yeah, so you can even do more, but we'll get to that.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.460]   care
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:28.200]   made, could think perceiveæ”¯ realm ì—„é•·, and, ,,,, negatively
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:42.920]   as
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:29:00.720]   appeared say he isĞ°Ñ‚
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:08.000]  TA
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:25.540]  , so now you can say okay well you can adopt that now you have threads now you have like
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.060]   additional things like you control memory hierarchy and so what mojo allows you to do
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.940]   is it allows you to start taking advantage of all these powerful things have been built into the
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:39.580]   hardware over time and it gives the library gives um very nice features so you can say just
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:46.460]   parallelize this do this in parallel right so it's very um very powerful weapons against slowness
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.700]   which is why people have been i think having fun like just taking code and making go fast because
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.260]   it's just kind of in a drum and rush to see like how fast you can get things before i talk about
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.020]   some of the interesting stuff with parallelization all that let's let's first talk about what
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:28.980]  obedience is and then we'll talk about the basics we talked to indentation right so this thing looks like python it's sexy and beautiful like python as i mentioned uh is it a typed language so what's the role of types yeah good question so python has types it has strings has integers it has dictionaries and like a lot of stuff but they all live at runtime right and so because all those types live at runtime and python you never you don't have to spell them python also has like this whole typing thing going on now
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   and so because all those types live at runtime and python you never you don't have to spell them python also has like this whole typing thing going on now
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   and so because all those types live at runtime and python you never you don't have to spell them python also has like this whole typing thing going on now
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:58.940]  ,

And so, then you can add however many types you want, wherever you want them. And if you don't want to deal with it, you don't have to deal with it. And so, one of, you know, our opinions on this,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.140]   and our opinions on this,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   is that it's not that types are the right thing or the wrong thing. It's that they're a useful thing.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:58.180]  ,
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   and that's why I think it's important to have a system that allows you to adopt types into your program.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   And so, I think it's important to have a system that allows you to adopt types into your program.

[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   You know, you have objectives that you're trying to attain.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   You know, you have objectives that you're trying to attain.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   You know, you have objectives that you're trying to attain.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   You know, you have objectives that you're trying to attain.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   So what if Python can achieve those objectives?
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   So what if Python can achieve those objectives?
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   So what if Python can achieve those objectives? So if you want types, well, maybe you want types because you want to make sure you're passing on the right thing.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   So what if Python can achieve those objectives? So if you want types, well, maybe you want types because you want to make sure you're passing on the right thing.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   Sure, you can add a type. If you don't care, you're prototyping some stuff, you're hacking some things out, you're like pulling some random code off the internet, it should just work.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:28.240]  , you're like pulling some random code off the internet, it should just work.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   So, you can't just say, "I want to use this type."
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   So, you can't just say, "I want to use this type."
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   So, you can't just say, "I want to use this type."

[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   And so, that means it has to work without types.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   And so, that means it has to work without types.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   And so, that means it has to work without types.

I'm not an expert in all the details, and I honestly don't want to be. I don't want the world to have to go through that. People can ignore Mojo, and if it's not their thing, that's cool. But if they want to use Mojo, I don't want them to have to rewrite all their code.

[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   - Okay, if I make something that is super fast, I can go all the way down to the metal. Why do I need to have integers built into the language? And so what Mojo does is it says, okay, well, we can have this notion of structs. So we have classes in Python, now you can have structs. Classes are dynamic, structs are static. Cool, we can get high performance, we can write C++ kind of code with structs if you want. These things mix and work beautifully together. But what that means is that you can go and implement strings and ints and floats and arrays and all that kind of stuff.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   - And all that kind of stuff in the language.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   - Mm-hmm.

People still have these problems. Right? And so you look at this and you say, and the way I look at this at least is to say, okay, well, we're solving big long standing problems.

Now that is an interesting and very powerful design principle that finds away a ton of bugs. You have to be careful to implement in an efficient way. You have their performance hit that's significant generally not if you implement the right way but it requires a lot of very low level getting the language right that's that I see
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   Yeah, there's a responsibility you feel because if you mess it up, there's very few opportunities to do it right. Yeah, there's a responsibility you feel because if you mess it up, there's very low level getting the language right. You have their performance hit that's that I see
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   Yeah, there's a responsibility you feel because if you implement the right way but it requires a lot of very low level getting the language right. You have their performance hit that's that I see
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   Yeah, there's a responsibility you feel because if you implement the right way but it requires a lot of very low level getting the language right. You have their performance hit that's that I see
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:50:20.900]  , you define a database class right and database class has an array of records something like that, right? And so the problem is that if you pass in a record or class instance into database, it'll take a hold of that object and then it assumes it has it. And if you're passing an object in, you have to know that that database is going to take it and therefore you shouldn't change it after you put it in the database, right? You just kind of have to know that. You just have to kind of know that, right? And so you roll out version one of the database, you just kind of have to know that. Of course Lex uses his own database, he just kind of have to know that.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   You built it, you understand how this works, right?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   Somebody else joins the team, they don't know this, right?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   So now they suddenly get bugs, you're having to maintain the database, you shake your fist, you argue the 10th time this happens, you're like, okay, we have to do something different, right?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   And so what you do is you go change your Python code and you change your database class to copy the record every time you add it.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   And so what ends up happening is you say, okay, I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database and then that way if somebody passes in a record,
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   and then that way if somebody passes in a record, you say, okay, I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database and then that way if somebody passes in a record,
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:51:20.940]  ,
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database and then that way if somebody passes in a record,
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   and then that way if somebody passes in a record, you say, okay, I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database and then that way if somebody passes in a record,
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   and then that way if somebody passes in a record, you say, okay, I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database and then that way if somebody passes in a record,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.100]   logically independent copy,
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   but we want to do that lazily.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.060]   And so what we do is we say, okay,
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.180]   if you pass something into a function,
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.640]   it doesn't actually make a copy.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.320]   What it actually does is it just increments a reference to it.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.020]   And if you pass it around, you stick it in your database,
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.220]   it can go in the database, you own it,
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.480]   and then you come back out of the stack,
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.180]   nobody's copied anything,
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.400]   you come back out of the stack,
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.440]   and then the caller lets go of it,
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.680]   well then you've just handed it off to the database,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.620]   you've transferred it,
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.960]   and there's no copies made.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   Now,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   and then you've just handed it off to the database,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   and there's no copies made.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   Now,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   you've just handed it off to the database,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   and there's no copies made.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   And then you go to town and you start modifying it.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   And then you go to town and you start modifying it.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   What happens is you get a copy lazily on demand. And so what this does is it gives you copies only when you need them. And it also, so it defines away the bugs, but it also generally reduces the number of copies in practice. But the implementation details are tricky here. So this is, yes, something with reference counting, but to make it performant,
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:20.980]  , so this is, yes, something with reference counting, but to make it performant,
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:20.980]  , so this is, something with reference counting, but to make it performant,
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:20.980]  , so this is, something with reference counting, but to make it performant,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.660]   across a number of different kinds of objects.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.740]   Yeah, well, so you need a couple of things.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.620]   So there's many, so this concept has existed in many different worlds.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.720]   And so, again, it's not novel research at all, right?
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.460]   The magic is getting the design right so that you can do this in a reasonable way, right?
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.160]   And so there's a number of components that go into this.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:47.260]   One is when you're passing around, so we're talking about Python and reference counting at the expense of doing that.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.000]   When you're passing values around, you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and so you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and so you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and so you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and so you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and so you don't want to do extra reference counting
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:21.020]   a reference semantic list that works the way you'd expect in Python.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:21.020]   But then you have to design a value semantic list.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:21.020]   And so you just have to implement that and then you implement the logic within.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:51.040]   And so you have to implement that and then you implement the logic within.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:51.040]   And so you have to implement that and then you implement the logic within.

That'd be huge. Now, if you're building an analog computer, you may not be a compiler specialist. These are different skill sets, right? And so you can hire some compiler people if you're running a big company, maybe. But it turns out, these are really like exotic new generation of compilers. Like this is a different thing.

[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:22.120]   And so I think this is a really good. Right. And so within machine learning algorithms, for example, people figured out that, hey, if I do a matrix multiplication and I do a relu, right, the classic activation function, it is way faster to do one pass over the data and then do the relu on the output. And so I think this is a really good.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:52.140]  ,
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.140]   And so I think this is a really good.

[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:52.180]   not everybody's a compiler person. I, I love compiler people, trust me, right? But not everybody can or should be a compiler person. Turns out that they're people that know analog computers really well, or they know some GPU internal architecture thing really well, or they know some crazy, sparse, numeric, interesting algorithm that is the cusp of research, but they're not compiler people. And so one of the challenges with this new wave of technology trying to turn everything into a compiler is, again, is it's excluded a ton of people.

[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:40.900]  venes.com. So, you know, I've been doing a lot of computing and preprocessing and other algorithms on the CPU. And then once I get it into the right shape, I shove it into the GPU, I do a lot of matrix multiplications and convolutions and things like this. And I get it back out, and I do some reductions and summaries, and I shove it across the wire, across the network to another machine. Right? And so you've got now, what are effectively two computers, a CPU and a GPU, talking to each other working together in a heterogeneous system. But that was 10 years ago, right?
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:51.240]   qui i

[01:23:32.960 --> 01:24:02.280]   can be a little bit of a challenge to be able to do this. But in my opinion, the world benefits from simple and predictable systems at the bottom, you can control. But then once you have a predictable execution layer, you can build lots of different policies on top of it. Right. And so one policy can be that the human programmer says, do that here, do that here, do that here, do that here and like fully manually controls everything. And the system should just do it. Right.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:30.800]   And then you then get into this mode of like people care more and more and more. And you say, okay, well, let's actually, like, make the heuristic better. Let's get into auto-tenant. Let's actually do a search of the space to decide what's going on.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:00.740]   Right.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:00.820]  . Well, then you get into this problem where you realize this is not a small space. This is a many dimensional hyperdimensional space that you cannot exhaustively search. So do you know of any algorithms that are good at searching very complicated spaces for? Don't tell me you're going to turn this into a machine learning problem. So then you turn into a machine learning problem and then you have a space of genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning and like all these, all these, including the human. So you can just go to the machine learning platform and then you can just go to the machine learning platform and then you have a space of genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning and like all these, all these, including

[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:17.100]   You started and did a little bit of a whirlwind overview of how you get 35,000 x speed up or more over Python.
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:25.280]   Jeremy Howard did a really great presentation about the basic like looking at the code. Here's how you get the speed up. Like you said, that's something we could
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.080]   probably developers can do for a full time job.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   It's still a very complex system.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   It's still a very complex system.

[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.280]   There's been a lot of people that have been working on the, okay, I don't make Python 2x faster, 10x faster or something like that.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:01.320]   Right.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.280]   And there have been a ton of projects in that vein.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:03.360]   Right.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.860]   Mojo started from the, what can the hardware do?
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:09.660]   Like what is the limit of physics?
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.820]   What is the speed of light?
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:11.560]   What is it?
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.200]   Like how fast can this thing go?
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.080]   And then how do I express that?
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:15.240]   Right.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.200]   And so it wasn't, it wasn't anchored relatively on make Python a little bit faster.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.580]   It's saying, cool, I know what the hardware can do.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.440]   Let's unlock that.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:23.500]   Right.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:33.480]   at

[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.280]   And so you can make, you know, ResNet 50 or some, or a house net or something, exception B1.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:35.120]   Like you can, you can do that, right? Because the models are small, they fit in your head, right?
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.680]   But as the models get bigger, more complicated, as the machines get more complicated, it stops working, right?
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.120]   And so this is where things like kernel fusion come in.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.480]   So what is kernel fusion?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:53.200]   This is this idea of saying, let's avoid going to memory and let's do that by building a new hybrid kernel and
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:29:23.040]   and then
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:23.040]   and then

[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   and then we'll do that.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:30:23.240]   and then we'll do that.

[01:30:49.940 --> 01:31:16.560]   rendition of the machine learning model. And that's something that a lot of machine learning infrastructure and tools and technologies don't have. Typical state of the art today is you walk up, particularly if you're deploying, if you walk up with a new model, you try to push it through the converter and the converter crashes. That's crazy. The state of ML tooling today is not anything that a C programmer would ever accept. And it's always been this kind of flaky set of tooling
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's been never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's been never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's been never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's been never been integrated well, and it's been never worked out well.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:43.220]   I never worked together because it's not designed together. It's built by different teams. It's built by different hardware vendors. It's built by different systems. It's built by different internet companies that are trying to solve their problems. And so that means that we get this fragmented terrible mess of complexity.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:36.540]   I'm going to go ahead and say, "Hey, I have a whole bunch of different, you know, what a multi-core computer is. It's basically a bunch of computers. And I can get to doing one or 16 at a time with vectors. That's called vectorization. Then you can say, "Hey, I have a whole bunch of different, you know, what a multi-core computer is. It's basically a bunch of computers."
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.680]   Then you can say, "Hey, I have a whole bunch of different, you know, what a multi-core computer is. It's basically a bunch of computers."
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.960]   So now what parallelize does is says, "Okay, run multiple instances on different computers."
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:07.480]   And now they can all work together on a problem.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:25.780]  obedient.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.760]   And size of the block size is all that's how you get to the auto tune to make right optimize.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:37.280]   Right. Yeah. Well, so all of these the details matter so much to get good performance. This is another funny thing about machine learning and high performance computing that is very different than C compilers we all grew up with where, you know, if you get a new version of GCC or new version of clang or something like that, you know, maybe something will go 1% faster.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   But you know, you can't get a new version of GCC or new version of clang or something like that, you know, maybe something will go 1% faster.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:59.480]  , right? And so compiler ensures will work really, really, really, really hard to get half a percent out of your C code, something like that. But when you're talking about an accelerator or an application or you're talking about these kinds of algorithms. And these are things people used to write in Fortran, for example, right? If you get it wrong, it's not 5% or 1%. It could be 2x or 10x.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:07.280]   Right? If you think about it, you really want to make use of the full memory of the full memory of the computer.
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:23.360]   You have the cache, for example. But if you use too much space, it doesn't fit in the cache. Now, you're going to be thrashing all the way back out to main memory. And these can be 2x 10x major performance differences. And so this is where getting these magic numbers and these things right is really actually quite important.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:35.120]   So you mentioned that Mojo is a superset of Python. Can you run Python code as if it's Mojo code?
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.620]   Yes.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.280]   Yes.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:37.280]   Yes.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:37.280]   Yes.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:37.300]   Yes.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   so and so and this has two sides of it. So Mojo is not done yet. So I'll give you a disclaimer. Mojo is not done yet. But already, we see people that take small pieces of Python code, move it over. They don't change it and you can get 12x speedups. Like somebody was just tweeting about that yesterday, which was pretty cool. Right? And again, interpreters compilers, right? And so without changing any code without also this is not what this is not jit compiling or doing anything fancy. This is just basic stuff moving it around.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   I mean, I mean, it's just a lot of a lot of time.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:07.500]   I mean, it's just a lot of time.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.040]   straight over.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:08.540]   straight over.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:27.640]   Now Mojo will continue to grow out and as it grows out, it will have more and more and more features. And our North Star is to be a full superset of Python and so you can bring over basically arbitrary Python code and have it just work. And it may not always be 12x faster, but but it should be at least as fast and way faster in many cases is the goal, right?
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:37.300]   Now take time to do that. And Python is a complicated language. It's not just the obvious things, but there's also non obvious things that are complicated. And so you can bring over basically arbitrary Python code and have it just work. And it may not always be 12x faster, but it should be at least as fast and way faster in many cases is the goal, right?

[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   So one different perspective on this will be why Mojo instead of making CPython faster, redesigning CPython. Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:41:04.600]   Yeah. Well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is a better and better and other things like that. There's lots of people working on that. So actually there's a team at Microsoft that is really improving. I think CPython 3.11 came out in October, something like that. And it was 15% faster, 20% faster across the board, which is pretty huge given how mature Python is and things like this. And so that's awesome. I love it.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:34.640]   It doesn't run on GPU. It doesn't do AI stuff, it doesn't do vectors, doesn't do things. 20% is good. 35,000 times is better. Right? So they're definitely I'm a huge fan of that work, by the way, and it composes well with what we're doing. And so it's not like we're fighting or anything like that. It's actually just goodness for the world. But it's just a different path. And again, we're not working forward from making Python a little bit better. We're working backwards from what is the limit of physics.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   We're not working backwards from what is the limit of physics.

[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:40.420]   I think it's profound.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:46:09.360]   And so Python, I've talked with Guido about this, it's like, it was not designed to do what we're doing. That was not the reason they built it this way, but because they really cared and they were very thoughtful about how they designed the language, it scales very elegantly in this space. But if you look at other languages, for example, C and C++, right, if you're building a superset, you get stuck with the design decisions of the subset. Right? And so, you know, I think it's really important to consider that.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:38.300]   It's like, I don't know, like, I don't know.

[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:51.480]   ado. I love that moment. But when you're working with people and you're working with code and dusty deck code bases and things like this, right? It's not about what's theoretically beautiful. It's about what's practical. What's real, what people actually use. And I don't meet a lot of people that say, I want to rewrite all my codes just for the sake of it.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:50:01.780]   By the way, there could be interesting possibilities. And we'll probably talk about it where AI can help rewrite some code that might be farther out future. But it's a really interesting one. How that could

[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:42.100]   ado. And I'm not saying this is Guido's perspective, but you know, there's this path of saying like, okay, well suddenly Python can suddenly go all the places it's never been able to go before. Right. And that means the Python can go even further and can have even more impact on the world.
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:47.340]   So in some sense, Mojo could be seen as Python 4.0.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:51.380]   I would not say that. I think that would drive a lot of people really crazy.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.140]   Because of the PTSD of the 3.0, 2.0.
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.920]   I'm willing to annoy people about Emacs versus
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.320]   Vim.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:57.040]   But not that one.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:57.700]   Or about TAS versus Spaces.
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:27.680]  , I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:57.700]  , I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.020]   I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.740]   Right. But you're talking people who have large scale code bases.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:07.720]   I mean, Apple's got the biggest, largest scale code base of Objective-C code, right?
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:13.680]   And so, you know, none of the companies, none of the iOS developers, none of the other developers want to rewrite everything all at once.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.000]   And so you want to be able to adopt things piece at a time.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.920]   And so a thing that I found that worked very well in the Swift community was saying, okay, cool.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.140]   And this is when Swift was very young.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:27.720]   And she said, okay, you have a million line of code Objective-C app.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:27.720]   You have a million line of code Objective-C app.

[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:24.860]   He's a grassroots, he really teaches,
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:26.900]   he's an incredible educator, he's an incredible teacher,
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:30.080]   but also legit in terms of a machine learning engineer
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:33.720]   himself, and he's been running the fast.ai
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:36.800]   and looking, I think, for exactly what you've got.
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:40.540]   - Exactly, and so, I mean, the first time,
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:44.540]   so I met Jeremy pretty early on, but the first time I sat
[02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:44.540]   -, and so on. - up and said,
[02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:44.540]   -, and so on. - but the first time I sat up

[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:16.680]   - and so on. - and so on.
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.680]   - and so on. - and if you're at Epoch Faster,
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:20.320]   - and so on. - and make the whole thing go vroom,
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:20.780]   - and so on. - right?
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:22.280]   - and so on. - and I'm like,
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:23.980]   - and so on. - this guy is incredible.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:25.740]   - and so on. - And so you can say,
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:26.980]   - and so on. - anyways, come back to,
[02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:27.620]   - and so on. - you know, where's Mojo
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:28.920]   - and so on. - coming from,
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:30.580]   - and so on. - Chris finally listened to Jeremy.
[02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:33.240]   - and so on. - It's all his fault.
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:36.380]   - Well, there's a kind of very
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:39.700]   - refreshing, pragmatic view that he has
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:42.620]   - about machine learning that,

I guess that's coupled with efficiency and performance, but it's not just obsessed about performance. So a lot of AI and AI research ends up being that it has to go fast enough to get scale. So a lot of people don't actually care about performance, particularly on the research side, until it allows them to have a bigger data.

[02:32:42.760 --> 02:33:12.760]   I think that's one of the things I've heard from smart people who've done a lot of this is that the packaging becomes a huge disaster when you get the Python and C together.
[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:12.760]   If you have this problem where you have code split between Python and C, now not only do you have to package the C code, you have to build the C code. C doesn't have a package manager. C doesn't have a dependency versioning management system. I'm not experiencing the state of the art and all the different Python package managers,
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:42.780]  , but I think that's a massive part of the problem. And I think Mojo solves that part of the problem directly heads on. Now, one of the things I think we'll do with the community, and this isn't, again, we're not solving all the world's problems at once, we have to be kind of focused to start with, is that I think that we will have an opportunity to reevaluate packaging.
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:42.780]   I think that we can come back and say, okay, well, given the new tools and technologies and the cool things we have that we've built up, because we have not just syntax, we have an entirely new compiler stack that works in a new way,
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:42.780]   and we have not just syntax, but we have an entirely new compiler stack that works in a new way,

[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:05.260]   So that means you put a lot of time into compatibility, and it means that you get locked into decisions of the past, even if they may not have been a good thing. Now, systems programmers typically like to control things. And they want to make sure that, you know, not in all cases, of course, and even systems programmers are not one thing, right? But often you want predictability. And so one of the things that Python has, for example, as you know, is that if you define a variable, you just say x equals four. I have a variable named x.
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:05.480]   Okay.
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:35.620]   So
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:05.400]  obedient. And so, you know, what fn does is it turns on, as you say, it's a strict mode. And so it says okay, well, you have to actually declare intentionally declare variables for use them. That gives you more predictability, more error checking and things like this, but you don't have to, you don't have to use it. And this is a way that Mojo is both compatible, because deaths work the same way that deaths have always worked, and provides a new alternative that gives you more control and allows certain kinds of people to have a different philosophy to be able to express that and get that.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:05.540]   Yeah, yeah.

[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:12.800]   Ğ¼Ğ¾Ğ¼en: Right. And so it gets complicated pretty quickly and so like "getting this right" was not -- you have to insert "delete" like in a lot of places. Potentially, yeah, exactly. The compiler has to reason about this and this is where, again, it's experience building languages and not getting this right. So again, you get another chance to do it and you get basic things like this, right? But it's extremely powerful when you do that. And so there's a bunch of things like that that kind of combine together. And this comes back to the you get a chance to do a new language.
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:12.800]   And there's a bunch of things like that that kind of combine together. And this comes back to the you get a chance to do a new language. So basically you get a new language and you can't to do a new language.
[02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:42.660]  - So if you're going to do a new language, you have to do it the right way, do it the right way, and make sure that every brick you put down is really good so that when you put more bricks on top of it, they stack up to something that's beautiful. Well, there's also how many design discussions do there have to be about particular details, like implementation of particular small features. The features that seem small, I bet some of them might require really big design decisions.
[02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:45.940]   Yeah. Well, so I mean, let me give you another example of this.
[02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:46.940]   Python has a feature called async await.
[02:59:46.940 --> 02:59:47.940]   So it's a new feature.
[02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:48.940]   I mean, in the long arc of Python history, it's a relatively new feature, right, that allows
[02:59:48.940 --> 02:59:49.940]   way more expressive asynchronous programming.
[02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:50.940]   Okay.
[02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:51.940]   Again, this is a Python's a beautiful thing.
[02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:52.940]   And they did things that are great for Mojo for completely different reasons.
[02:59:52.940 --> 02:59:53.940]   The reason the async await got added to Python, as far as I know, is because Python doesn't support threads.
[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:54.940]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[02:59:54.940 --> 02:59:55.940]   That allows way more expressive asynchronous programming.
[02:59:55.940 --> 02:59:56.940]   Okay.
[02:59:56.940 --> 02:59:57.940]   Again, this is a Python's a beautiful thing.
[02:59:57.940 --> 02:59:58.940]   And they did things that are great for Mojo for completely different reasons.
[02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:10.940]   The reason the async await got added to Python, as far as far as I know, is because Python doesn't support threads.
[03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:40.220]  - Okay.
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:42.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:43.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:44.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:44.260 --> 03:00:45.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:46.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:46.260 --> 03:00:47.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:48.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:49.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:50.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:51.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:51.260 --> 03:00:52.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:53.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:54.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:55.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:55.260 --> 03:00:56.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:56.260 --> 03:00:57.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:57.260 --> 03:00:58.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:00:59.260]   Yeah.
[03:00:59.260 --> 03:01:00.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:01.260]   Yeah.
[03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:02.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:03.260]   Yeah.

[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:06.260]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:07.260]   Yeah.
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:35.300]  - Yeah.
[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:36.300]   So it's a relatively new feature, right?
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:37.300]   Yeah.
[03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:37.300]   We're going to talk about that in a minute.

[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:38.340]   Transportation is going to be a big part of the community because, again, if you scale something really fast and everybody writes all they're good and they start using it in production, then it's impossible to change.
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:39.340]   And so you want to learn from people, you want to iterate and work on that early on, and this is where design discussions, it's actually quite important.
