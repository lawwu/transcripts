[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   So the existence of sex is the most pessimistic thing there is.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.940]   I find that ironic.
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.940]   So I'm not the pessimist sex is, right?
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.500]   So it could be Y Combinator is a bit stale, but stale in the good sense.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.940]   Like Harvard is stale, right?
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.940]   It dates from the 17th century, but it's still amazing.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.200]   We'll be permanently set back kind of forever.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.180]   And in the meantime, we can't build asteroid protection or whatever else.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.000]   And it will just be like medieval living standards, super small population,
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.400]   feudal governance, lots of violence, rape, whatever.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.580]   A lot of the IDW people have very clear peaks, which now lie in the past.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.640]   But they made extreme bets on very particular ideas.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.380]   And maybe different people will disagree about those ideas.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.040]   But I think a lot of them are losing ideas,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.100]   even if they might be correct in some ways.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000]   I've done much less to bet on a single idea.
