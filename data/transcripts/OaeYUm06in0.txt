[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.520]   The following is a conversation with Carl Deisseroth,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.540]   professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.580]   and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.140]   He's one of the greatest living psychiatrists
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.460]   and neuroscientists in the world.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.540]   He's also just a fascinating human being.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.340]   We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.620]   that the human mind can take us.
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.900]   He explores this in his book called "Projections,
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900]   a Story of Human Emotions."
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.780]   I highly recommend it.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.340]   It's written masterfully.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.260]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.380]   in the description.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.220]   And now, dear friends, here's Carl Deisseroth.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.660]   You open your book called "Projections,
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.500]   a Story of Human Emotions" with a few beautiful words
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.140]   to summarize all of humanity.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.180]   The book draws insights about the human mind
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.240]   from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.500]   So if it's okay, let me read a few sentences
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.060]   from the opening.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.820]   You gotta give props to beautiful writing when I see it.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.460]   Quote, "In the art of weaving,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.580]   "warp threads are structural and strong
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920]   "and anchored at the origin,

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.060]   "to the ragged present, to the yet featureless future."
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.700]   Yet featureless future, well done, well done, sir.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840]   "The tapestry of the human story has its own warp threads,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.520]   "rooted deep in the gorges of East Africa,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240]   "connecting the shifting textures of human life

[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.400]   "The inner workings of the mind give form to these threads,

[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.100]   "and raw and revealing.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.920]   "What have you learned about human beings,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.480]   "human nature and the human mind
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   "from those who suffer from psychiatric maladies,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.240]   "for those for whom this fabric is warped?"
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.400]   - One thing we learn as biologists
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.560]   is that when something breaks,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   you see what the original unbroken part was for.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   And we see this in genetics, we see this in biochemistry.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.440]   It's known that when you have a mutated gene,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.880]   sometimes the gene is turned up in strength
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.280]   or turned down in strength.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   And that lets you see what it was originally for.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.960]   You can infer true function from dysfunction.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.160]   And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.320]   and needed to be made communicable
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.080]   to the lay public, to everybody.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.440]   People who, which is I think almost all of us,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.800]   who think and care about the inner workings of our mind,
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.360]   but who also care for those who have been suffering,
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.760]   But then more broadly,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   it's a very much larger story than the present.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.960]   There's a story to be told
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.160]   where the protagonist really is the human mind.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   And that was one thing I wanted to share as well
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.360]   in "Projections" is that broader story,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.480]   but still anchored in the moment of patients,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.960]   of people, of experiences of the moment.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.320]   - Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.580]   disorder and order?
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.440]   - This is always debated in psychiatry,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.540]   probably more so than any other medical specialty.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.760]   I'm a psychiatrist.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.680]   I treat patients still.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.320]   I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.520]   where there's no doubt that this is not something
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.720]   that's working well,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.300]   where the manifestation of disease is so powerful,
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.980]   where the person is suffering so greatly,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.680]   where they cannot continue as they are.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.000]   But of course it's a spectrum,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.400]   and there are people who are closer to the realm
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.560]   of being able to work okay in their jobs,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   but suffer from some small dysfunction.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.880]   And everywhere in between.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.400]   In psychiatry, we're careful to say
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.160]   we don't call it a disease or a disorder
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.200]   unless there's a disruption
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.360]   in social or occupational functioning.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.800]   in terms of developing quantitative tests.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.700]   We don't have blood draws.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.760]   We don't have imaging studies that we can use to diagnose.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   And so that line ultimately that you're asking about
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.420]   between order and disorder, function and dysfunction,
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.800]   it's operational at the moment.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.960]   How are things working?
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.760]   - Can we just like linger on the terms for a second?
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.440]   So this disease, dysfunction,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.960]   how careful should we be using those words?
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.220]   Can we just, even in this conversation,
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.400]   from a sort of technical perspective,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.560]   but also a human perspective,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   how quick should we be in saying that schizophrenia,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.820]   depression, autism,
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.860]   as we kind of go down across the spectrum
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.660]   of different maladies,
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.700]   to use the word dysfunction and disease?
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.760]   - I would say to give ourselves license
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.980]   to capture the whole spectrum, let's say disorder,
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.140]   because that captures, truly, I think, the essence of it,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.660]   which is we need to talk about it when it's not working,
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.660]   when there's disorder.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.660]   And that's the fairest and most inclusive term to use.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.060]   - So is it fair to assume that basically
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.660]   every member of the human species
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.380]   suffers from a large number of disorders then?
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.220]   - Well--
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.540]   - And we just have to pick which ones
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.100]   are debilitating for each person?
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.180]   - You know, if you look at the numbers,
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.860]   there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.820]   are currently defined,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.540]   you can look at population prevalence values
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.560]   for all these disorders.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.900]   And you can come up with estimates
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.180]   that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.660]   of having a psychiatric disorder
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.940]   that approaches 25% or so.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.180]   And so that's, and in some studies it could be more,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.480]   some studies it could be less.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.300]   Now, what do we do with that number?
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.140]   What does that mean?
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.540]   And in some ways, that's the essence
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.900]   of what I was hoping to approach with the book,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.640]   is to reflect on this spectrum
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.020]   that exists for all the disorders.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.460]   There is, and taking nothing away from the severity
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.700]   and the suffering that comes at the extreme end
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.100]   of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.180]   exists on a spectrum of severity,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.460]   from nearly functional to completely dysfunctional,
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.260]   life-threatening, and even fatal.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.500]   And so that number, 25%, more or less,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.980]   - To linger on that number,
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.460]   where do those numbers come from?
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.340]   Is it self-report?
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.080]   Is it people who show up and say, "I need help"?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.900]   Is it somebody else that points out,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.740]   "That person needs help"?
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.220]   Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.900]   for people who don't ask for help
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.660]   but are suffering quietly alone?
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.260]   - When you look at self-report numbers,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.800]   then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.820]   Those, the most rigorous studies are done
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.640]   with structured psychiatric interviews,
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.620]   where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.500]   carefully do complete psychiatric inventories
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.740]   of individuals.
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.540]   And these are time-consuming, laborious studies
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.860]   that are not often repeated.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.180]   When they're done, they're done well.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.900]   But very often, you'll see a report
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.020]   or something in the news of a very high number
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.100]   for some disorder or symptom.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.500]   And very often, if it's shockingly high,
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.900]   that's coming from a self-report of a person.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.380]   And so that's another issue that we have.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.300]   Again, take nothing away from the severity and reality
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.860]   and biological nature of these disorders,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.500]   which are very genetic, very, you know,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.940]   we understand that these are very biological.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.500]   And yet, we lack right now the lab tests
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.420]   and the blood draws to make the diagnoses.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.240]   - Well, we'll talk about it, just how biological they are,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.540]   'cause that too is a mystery.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.580]   In terms of from a perspective of how to probe
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.660]   into the disease, how to understand it, how to help it.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.020]   So some of it could be neurobiological.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.900]   Some of it could be just the dance of human emotion
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.860]   and interaction.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:13.540]   Is love when it works and is love when it breaks down
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   biological or is it something else?
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.340]   So we're gonna talk about it.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.460]   But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.540]   What about genius?
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.740]   You know, that sort of cliche saying,
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.100]   like the madness and genius,
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.860]   that they kind of dance together.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.380]   What about if the thing we see as disorder
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.540]   is actually genius, unheard, or misunderstood?
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.300]   - Well, here again, the numbers help us.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.340]   And here's where being rigorous and quantitative
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.280]   actually really helps.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.500]   If you look at disorders like autism and bipolar disorder
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.060]   and eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, for example,
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.940]   these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.380]   these can be fatal.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.760]   They can cause immense suffering,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.500]   but they are heavily genetic, all three of these.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.760]   And what's very interesting is each one of these three
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.660]   is actually correlated positively, positively,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.580]   with measures of intelligence, of educational attainment,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.220]   and even of income.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.700]   And so you look at this, severe disorders in many cases,
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.540]   causing quite immense morbidity and mortality.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.900]   And yet they are positively correlated
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.220]   at the population level with positive things.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.820]   - Can you say the three again?
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.660]   Autism. - Yeah.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.300]   Autism, anorexia, and bipolar disorder.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.380]   - Bipolar, right.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.340]   What's that book, forgot the book name,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.520]   but is intelligence a burden?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:48.100]   - Well, you know, people can get into trouble
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.580]   when they think they're smarter than they are,
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.500]   I will say that.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.420]   - I don't know.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.860]   - Sometimes, like, in the deepest meaning of that statement,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.220]   I think ignorance is bliss.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.940]   I'm a big fan of Prince Mishkin from "The Idiot"
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.420]   and Alyosha from "Brother Karamazov."
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.100]   Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.660]   Maybe inability to reason
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.460]   sort of about the mechanics of the world,
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.660]   but instead kind of feel the world.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.280]   It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.120]   - There is.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.860]   How much you think versus how much you feel,
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.140]   this comes up all the time.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.720]   In medicine, we encounter this all the time.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.900]   When you, day after day, you encounter this,
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.620]   you know, the abyss of suffering from patients.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.420]   How much do you let yourself feel?
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.500]   Or how much do you make it abstract and objective
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.580]   and try to make it clinical?
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.100]   In that range, how you're able to move yourself
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.220]   on that spectrum is very important
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.000]   for survival as a physician.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.460]   And the way you protect yourself and your feelings
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.180]   turns out to be very important.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.700]   - You quote "Finnegan's Wake,"
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.220]   mad props for that James Joyce book.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.740]   I took a class on James Joyce in college.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.620]   I think I read parts of "Finnegan's Wake."
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.620]   I might have been on drugs of some kind.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.700]   I somehow got an A in that class,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.000]   which probably refers to some kind of curve
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.800]   where nobody understood anything.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.420]   The only thing I understood and really enjoyed
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.340]   is his short stories, "The Dead."
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.380]   And then Ulysses, I kind of, I think,
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.900]   read a few Cliff Notes that kind of got to the point.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.660]   And then "Finnegan's Wake" was just a hopeless pursuit.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.660]   It's a, for people who haven't looked at it,
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.180]   maybe you can elucidate to me better,
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.180]   but I felt like I was reading things, words,
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.740]   and the words made sense, like standing next to each other.
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.500]   But when you kind of read for a while,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.980]   you realize you didn't actually understand
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.060]   anything that was said.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.860]   - Right, but did you have a feeling though?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.860]   That's one thing I found interesting about "Finnegan's Wake."
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.580]   I never fully understood it,
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.220]   but the words caused feelings in me,
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.880]   which I found fascinating.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.820]   And sometimes I couldn't predict it
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.660]   from the semantic black and white context
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.940]   of what I was seeing in front of me on the page.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.220]   But the rhythm or the melody
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.520]   would make me feel certain ways.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.580]   And that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.860]   Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum too.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.900]   And he wrote, as you say, more accessible works.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.420]   I learned a lot about Irish history
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.740]   from "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.140]   And there was just, he could be as objective
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.300]   as he wanted to be.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.260]   But then when he let himself loose,
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.820]   he was in this realm where the words had their own purpose
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.700]   separate from semantic meaning,
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.100]   from their dry dictionary definition.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.380]   You know, there's a funny story that was told.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.700]   Doesn't matter if it's true or not,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.020]   but they said that James Joyce, when he was young,
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.340]   when he was in his teen years,
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.780]   would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.020]   and telling everybody that he's going to be one of,
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.060]   if not the greatest writers of the 20th century.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.180]   And he turned out to be that.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.740]   So I always think about that little story
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.680]   that somebody told me,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.140]   because I have a lot of people come up to me,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.260]   including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.500]   You get into certain moods where you say,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.780]   I'm going to be the greatest anything ever.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.420]   You get like people tell you this,
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.220]   especially young people.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.180]   And it kind of, it makes me feel all kinds of ways,
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.260]   but that story reminds me that you just might be
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.420]   one of the greatest writers of the 21st century,
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.460]   for example, if somebody were to tell me that.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.940]   And don't immediately disregard that,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.320]   'cause one of the people that say that,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.300]   that's almost like a precondition,
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.600]   that's like a requirement just to believe in yourself.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.060]   Maybe it's not a full requirement,
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.240]   but it's an interesting story.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.300]   - I think when someone tells you that,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.880]   then it creates, one sees an opportunity,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.940]   and then it would be a tragedy
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.540]   if the opportunity weren't captured, right?
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.100]   And so then that creates some impetus,
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.020]   some motivation to do something good.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.860]   - I think the mind, it's like,
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.940]   I guess that's what books or whatever,
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.820]   I don't even know if it's a book,
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.700]   The Secret plugs into,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.460]   they kind of make a whole industry out of it.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.220]   But there is something about the mind
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.380]   believing something, making it a reality.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.060]   It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.860]   your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea,
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.080]   sort of embracing the me versus the world,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.980]   embracing the madness of this idea
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.420]   and making it a life pursuit,
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.900]   somehow morse reality for some tiny fraction
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.740]   of the population, for everybody else,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   you descend into all the beautiful ways
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.700]   that failure materializes in our lifetime.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.540]   (laughing)
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.900]   - You know, you mentioned love earlier,
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.340]   I mean, that's a great example
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.340]   of how belief in something makes it real, right?
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.180]   It's not reasonable on the face of it,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.540]   but because you believe it's reasonable,
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.900]   then it actually does become reasonable
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.740]   and then it is real.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.100]   And so that's a good example.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.940]   That doesn't happen.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.940]   I'm also in a bioengineering department.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.460]   We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.500]   and then it is soundly built.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.100]   That's something that,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.260]   it doesn't come up in too many realms of human existence,
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.500]   but love is one of them.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   And the ability to have a fixed idea
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.380]   and to say it's true and then it is true.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.580]   - A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.980]   So maybe it does work a little bit,
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.340]   but it can break down like Chernobyl did.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.980]   You can't just say it's safe.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.300]   You have to also prove it's safe.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.380]   But on Finnegan's Wake,
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.100]   I think, maybe correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.700]   you're using kind of Finnegan's Wake
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.260]   to give one perspective on what madness is,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.740]   of what's going on in the mind.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.740]   How much of that is that we're simply unable
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.980]   to communicate with the person
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.780]   on the other side of their mind?
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.580]   Like there's almost like a little person inside the brain
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.620]   and they have some circuitry
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.740]   that's used to communicate emotion,
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.060]   communicate ideas to the outside world.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.620]   And there's something about that circuitry
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.180]   that makes it difficult to communicate
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.900]   with the little person on the other side.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.220]   - So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia,
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.140]   with many cases, what we call thought disorders,
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.020]   what we call the individual speech symptoms
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.700]   of schizophrenia, Finnegan's Wake is loaded with them.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.260]   And it's just full of them.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.860]   We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.980]   where the word that is said echoes in some way
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.820]   the previous word.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.900]   And we call that a clang association
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900]   'cause there's no other reason
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.300]   than the similarity of the sound,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.180]   like a clang of a garage door being hit.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.580]   And it has a, and sometimes it's not even a word.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.940]   And we call that a neologism, a new word being created.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.220]   And of course, Finnegan's Wake is full of that.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.180]   And then we also, in schizophrenia,
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.980]   where there's what we call loose associations
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.020]   or tangential thought processes,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.900]   of course, full of that,
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.420]   where things just go off in directions
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.260]   that are not linear or logical.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.620]   And you can't read Finnegan's Wake, I think,
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.500]   without, certainly as a psychiatrist,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.100]   you can't read it without thinking about schizophrenia.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.420]   And then when we look at the families of people
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.540]   with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception,
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.540]   there very often are people within the family
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.860]   who are on the spectrum.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.860]   Some have it, some are able to see it from a distance,
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.820]   from a safe distance.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.020]   There's an association between schizophrenia
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.580]   and what we call schizotypal personality disorder,
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.900]   where people are not quite in this severe state
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.900]   of schizophrenia, but have some magical thinking,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.540]   have some unusual thought patterns.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.020]   Very often, those are family members
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.620]   of people with schizophrenia.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.140]   So this points to this, again, to this idea
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.140]   that there is a range, even along this very severe,
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.500]   very genetic biological illness,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.260]   that human beings dwell on different spots
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.460]   along that spectrum.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.340]   - I should mention that we have my friend Sergei
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.860]   pulling up stuff, young Sergei or old Sergei,
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.740]   I don't know what to call you,
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   but there's drafts of Finnegan's Wake.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.100]   Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.060]   I think it was on Instagram or something.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.220]   These are early drafts of Finnegan's Wake.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.380]   And it's so beautiful to see,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.940]   for people who are just listening,
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.740]   there's just random paragraphs and writing
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.060]   all over the page with stuff crossed out.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.260]   And it's great to see that Joyce himself
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.900]   was thinking in this kind of way
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.740]   as you're putting it together.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.940]   How much do you think he was thinking
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.300]   about the schizophrenic mind?
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.140]   - I think a lot.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.140]   I think it's known that his daughter
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.860]   suffered from schizophrenia.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.820]   And this is, what's depicted here on the page
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.580]   is something that I'm sure he either felt himself
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.420]   and some level was able to access
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.260]   this non-linearity of processing
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.580]   or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.940]   and was able to reflect it down in black and white
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.780]   on the paper.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.220]   So what he was able to do was quite authentic in that sense.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.900]   Of course, I don't wanna pigeonhole him.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.740]   He was doing much more than that.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.420]   It was much more than talking about altered human
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.300]   thought processes and thought disorders.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.740]   But that was an aspect that he was so good at representing
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.500]   that it had to be intentional to some extent.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.700]   - And a tiny tangent,
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.980]   what does your own writing look like for this book?
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.180]   'Cause it's extremely well-written.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.980]   How many edits?
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.060]   Did you just drink some whiskey
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.420]   and like imagine Hemingway style?
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.420]   What's a very different, the writing is very different.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.660]   I mean, it's really, really well-written,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.180]   which was like, I was reading it.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.180]   It makes you realize,
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.580]   'cause I was expecting sort of a science kind of,
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.580]   which it is like elucidating something
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.860]   about the human mind kind of thing.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.860]   But you could also probably write really strong novels.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.940]   So maybe that's in the future.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.140]   But anyway, what is your, how many edits?
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.260]   How many, what's your style?
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.300]   Does it look like that?
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.860]   Is it more structured, organized?
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.460]   - Unfortunately, I used a laptop,
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.500]   so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   - No typewriter, cigarette and whiskey.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.380]   - I did explore, I was, you know,
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.140]   which was there a particular altered state
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.860]   that would help me to be most creative.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.900]   And I found actually, I actually did the best while,
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.620]   you know, sober, but slightly disinhibited
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.300]   in the late hours of the night or early morning.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.700]   Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.380]   I have a friend who would tell me
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.660]   that she thought that very early in the morning,
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.140]   her inner critic was still asleep
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.260]   and she could write more effectively
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.300]   before her inner critic woke up.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.820]   And I actually found that outstanding advice for me
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   that I often found that there was,
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.340]   I was looser and could write more in the morning.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.100]   But the other interesting thing is each chapter,
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.500]   each story, it's about a different human being
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.460]   with a different class of psychiatric disorder.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.900]   That's what each story, each chapter is anchored in.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   But I'm trying to use words that in style of writing
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.980]   and, you know, diction that captures the feeling
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.940]   of the disorder.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.860]   And so it's different in each story.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.500]   In the story about mania, which is a very expansive,
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.260]   exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.180]   where the words come out in a torrent
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.580]   and they're complex and pressured and elaborate.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.260]   I try to capture that feeling
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.460]   with the words used in that chapter.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.540]   And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.420]   where things slowly fragment over time
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.820]   and become looser and separated,
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.820]   I tried to capture that in the writing too.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.720]   So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.300]   I could be in for the whole book.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.220]   For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.380]   to capture that inner feeling of the disorder.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.460]   - When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.860]   - Yeah, I couldn't turn it on and off right away.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.820]   I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.180]   or the people, one or two people based on real patients
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.920]   and the stories that are put forth.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.320]   The symptom descriptions are real,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.200]   they're from the patients.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.360]   Of course, all details change to protect privacy,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.020]   but the actual symptom descriptions are real.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.200]   And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.620]   the space of the mind of that person that I knew.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.800]   And that's not instantaneous, it would take some time.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.180]   I needed quiet, I needed to be still.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.660]   That's another reason late at night is good.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.780]   - Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.820]   according to Andrew Huberman.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.660]   Thank you, Andrew.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.580]   (laughing)
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.100]   - He's not wrong, he's not wrong.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.780]   - Why projections?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.220]   Is it, I mean, there's, instead of putting words
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.340]   into your mouth, 'cause I can imagine a lot,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.720]   I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.980]   despite what I just said.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.520]   So, I mean, to me, projections,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.040]   working on neural networks, for example,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.400]   from artificial neural networks,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   from a machine learning perspective,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.560]   it's often, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.320]   You have an incredibly complex thing
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.000]   and you're trying to find simple representations
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.680]   in order for you to make sense of it.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.800]   So I was kind of thinking about it in that way,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   which is like this incredibly complex neuronal network
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.960]   that is kind of projecting itself onto the world
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.520]   through this low bandwidth expression of emotion
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.320]   and speech and all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.040]   And the way it's, we only have that window into your soul,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.480]   the eyes and the speech and so on.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.040]   So that, in that way, where when there's any kind
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.320]   of disorder, we get to only see that disorder
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.160]   through that narrow window,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.120]   as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.880]   - The word projections definitely serves that purpose here,
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.640]   but it's got a few other really appropriate
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.360]   other connotations as well.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.920]   So the first thing is a projection
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.800]   in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.880]   that goes from one part of the brain to another.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.560]   And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.920]   There are projections, long range connections of axons.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.320]   These are the outgoing threads that connect
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.720]   one part of the brain to another part.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.880]   There's a projection that links, for example,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.120]   auditory cortex, where we hear things,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.920]   to reward centers where we can feel,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.040]   where feelings of pleasure and reward are initiated.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.440]   And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.520]   along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.720]   And so these connections, these projections matter.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.840]   They define how effectively two parts of the brain
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.480]   can engage with each other and join together
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.700]   to form a joint representation of something.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.540]   So that's one meaning.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.360]   It's pure neuroscience.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.400]   The word projection is used all the time.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.760]   And it happens to be something that optogenetics,
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.000]   a technique that maybe we'll talk about a little later,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.160]   it works particularly well with.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.920]   We can use light to turn on or off the activity
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.800]   along these projections from one spot
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.840]   of the brain to another.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.040]   - And this is particularly referring
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.800]   to the long range connections.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.320]   - It's particularly straightforward
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.680]   along these long range projections
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.800]   that connect different parts of the brain.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.040]   But it works over a shorter range too.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.120]   But then there's this other meaning of projections
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.760]   which you were bringing up, which is very relevant,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.040]   which is at some point you can reduce something
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.120]   from one level of dimensionality to another,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.280]   and you can project down into a lower dimensional space,
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.840]   for example.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.640]   And then finally there's a psychiatric term,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.200]   projections, which comes up all the time,
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   which is we very often will look at our internal states
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.720]   and to understand somebody else,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.520]   we'll project them onto somebody else,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.800]   we'll try to understand someone else's behavior
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.400]   and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.880]   our own sort of narrative onto them,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.000]   and use that as a way to help us understand them better.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.120]   And we'll do the reverse too.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.400]   We'll take things we see in the outside world
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.640]   and we'll bring them into ourselves
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   and see how well they map, how well they align.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.200]   That's called introjection.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.840]   So projections turns out to be a really rich word.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.680]   And then finally, of course, there's the very common sense
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.960]   of it as a projector that illuminates
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.920]   by conveying information across space with light.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.280]   So for English, for English language,
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.200]   perfect word to use for this book.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.340]   But what's funny is not every,
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.000]   there are a lot of international translations now
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.760]   and all those rich connotations
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.680]   aren't captured in other languages.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.920]   And so for some translations,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.400]   connections is used instead of projections.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.120]   In fact, even in England,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.320]   the British version is connections instead of projections
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.040]   because apparently projections
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.600]   doesn't have the full connotation I was told.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.560]   - So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.880]   of meaning with connections.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.920]   That's interesting.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.680]   I mean, and words are so interesting.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.000]   They have so many meanings.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.960]   I love language and how much is lost in translation.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.760]   I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   I'm not good at languages.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.560]   I was just, I guess, forced to by life's circumstance
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.720]   to learn two languages, Russian and English.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.640]   And it's just so interesting to watch how much of culture,
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.680]   how much of people, how much of history
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.280]   is lost in translation.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.960]   The poetry, the music, the history, the pain,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.880]   the way the scientists actually express themselves,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.000]   which is funny.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.240]   I mean, just, it's so sad
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   to see how much brilliant work that was written in Russian.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.840]   There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.920]   that is now lost.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.000]   It makes me wonder in the modern day
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.120]   how much incredible science is going on in China
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.920]   that is lost in translation.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.360]   because I'll never learn Chinese in the same way
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.800]   that I've learned English and Russian.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.920]   Maybe, whenever I say stuff like that,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.120]   people are like, "Well, there's still time."
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.840]   Yeah, that's actually fair.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.800]   That I think the 21st century,
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.960]   both China and US will have very important roles
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.640]   in the scientific development.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.880]   And we should actually bridge the gap through language.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.440]   And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.680]   to speak English.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.240]   That means also learning Chinese.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.840]   - Well, we need these bridge people who can do both.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.920]   Nabokov, for example, writing in English beautifully.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.360]   One of my favorite poets, Borges, who I mentioned earlier,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.840]   he wrote both in English and in Spanish.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.760]   I think beautifully in both.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.720]   We need those people who can serve
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.560]   as bridges across cultures who really can do both.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.400]   - You mentioned Borges.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.240]   So you open your book with a few lines
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.880]   from a poem by Jorge Luis Borges, a love poem.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.000]   I'm gonna read parts of it
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.640]   'cause it's a damn good poem.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.360]   It's called "Two English Poems."
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.080]   I mean, I'd like to understand why you used it
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.480]   and the specific parts you used, which is interesting.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.440]   But then when I read the full thing,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.040]   of what it means to delve deep into understanding,
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.440]   offering yourself to the task of understanding
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.960]   another human being.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.000]   But if you look at the full context of the poem,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.040]   it's also a damn good description of being hit by love
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.120]   and overtaken by it and sort of,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.520]   trying to figure out how to make sense of the world
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.280]   now that you've been stricken by it.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   It says a bunch of things about chatting insignificantly
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.000]   with friends and all those kinds of things.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.600]   And then the poem reads, "The big wave brought you."
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.160]   I get this is the moment, I guess, of the universe
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.720]   where the two people, you fall in love.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.800]   Maybe I'm totally misreading this poem, by the way.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.840]   Doesn't matter, you can't misread a poem.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   So it goes on, "Words, any words, your laughter,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   "and you so lazily and incessantly beautiful.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.800]   "We talked and you have forgotten the words.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.480]   "The shattering dawn finds me
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.660]   "in a deserted street of my city.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   "Your profile turned away.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.220]   "The sounds that go to make your name.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.040]   "The lilt of your laughter.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.280]   "These are the illustrious toys you have left me."
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.320]   So these little memories of these peculiar little details,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.080]   he remembers, those are the illustrious toys.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.200]   I apologize to mix my own words with the poem,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.560]   but you should definitely read it.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.720]   "I turn them over in the dawn.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.740]   "I lose them, I find them.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.660]   "I tell them to the few stray dogs
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.980]   "and to the few stray stars of the dawn.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:09.000]   "Your dark, rich life.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.540]   "I must get at you somehow.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.420]   "I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.920]   "I want your hidden look, your real smile.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.020]   "That lonely, mocking smile your cool mirror knows.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.000]   "I want your hidden look, your real smile."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.060]   So this is the first part of the poem,
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.420]   and then it goes on,
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.960]   which is some of the parts that you referenced.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.900]   Second part is, "What can I hold you with?
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.420]   "I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets,
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.240]   "the moon of the jagged suburbs.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.000]   "I offer you the bitterness of a man
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.140]   "who has looked long and long in a lonely moon.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.360]   "I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.260]   "the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.120]   "My father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.680]   "two bullets through his lungs," and so on, so on.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.380]   "I offer you whatever insights my books may hold,
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.500]   "whatever manliness, a humor my life.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.720]   "I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.960]   "I offer you that kernel of myself
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.160]   "that I have saved somehow,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.560]   "the central heart that deals not in words,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.000]   "traffics, not with dreams,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.560]   "and is untouched by time, my joy, and adversities."
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.980]   And I think this is the part that you include in the book.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.520]   "I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset,
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.300]   "years before you were born."
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.660]   Damn, that's a good line.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.980]   Okay. (laughs)
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.180]   "I offer you explanations of yourself,
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.440]   "theories about yourself,
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.000]   "authentic and surprising news of yourself.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   "I can give you my loneliness, my darkness,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.480]   "the hunger of my heart.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.560]   "I'm trying to bribe you with uncertainty,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.620]   "with danger, with defeat.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.000]   "That is a man who's in love and longing."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.960]   If taken, but I just wanna go back to,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.120]   maybe you could say why you wanted to include that poem,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.960]   but also, "Your dark rich life, I must get at you somehow.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.320]   "I put away those illustrious toys you have left me out.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.960]   "I want your hidden look, your real smile,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.740]   "that lonely mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.060]   "Sometimes I meet a stranger, and I just,
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.800]   "it's like a double take.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.700]   "It's like, who are you?
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.360]   "Have we met before somewhere?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.200]   "Who's that person behind there?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.960]   "And I wanna get at that, whatever that is."
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   And of course, maybe that's what love is,
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.160]   because maybe that's the whole pursuit,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.320]   like a lifelong pursuit of getting at that person.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.600]   Maybe that's what that is,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.920]   and that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.380]   like, well, who's that person in your own private life?
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.660]   - Yeah, so that, absolutely, I think that,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.860]   it was a beautiful description of what you just said,
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.800]   when there's that first moment,
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.840]   and then you wanna dive deeper,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.120]   you want to know what the hidden mysteries are.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.240]   In a way, it's a love poem.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.500]   As a scientist, though, it also,
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.080]   it's a bit of how a scientist can love science,
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   and that wanting to dive deeper is,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.720]   it's almost like, again, where the,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   it could be a love affair with investigating
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.280]   the human mind, for example,
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.560]   and that was one reason it spoke to me also.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.120]   Again, thinking about the broader sweep
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.840]   of where the human mind came from,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.000]   the steps it took to get where it is today,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.920]   what was given up along the way,
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.160]   what compromises were made,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.760]   and here's where the darkness of the poem
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.480]   starts to come in a little bit, too.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.080]   It doesn't shy away from the negativity,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.120]   from the confusion, from the danger,
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.360]   and then at the very end,
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.540]   the, Borges is offering up scenes from his life,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.560]   parts of himself, and this is how we connect with people.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.920]   We offer up parts of ourselves, just, here it is,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.640]   and then we see, how well does that map onto what you have?
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.800]   And it's that offering up that I liked,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.400]   and not the good stuff, or not only the good stuff.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   The yellow rose is nice,
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.640]   but he's offering up the bad stuff, too,
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.240]   and that, to me, was important for the book,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.000]   because I'm offering up hard stuff, too,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.200]   in fact, a lot of it,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.420]   and also hard stuff from within me,
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.080]   from my own personal side, too,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.480]   and that was, there's a lot of vulnerability
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.240]   that comes with that, but that's,
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.280]   that comes with love, that comes with writing.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.560]   You have to be open, you have to be vulnerable,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.160]   and so I thought that reflected what I was trying to do,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.720]   and I thought it was, as an epigraph,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   it kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.280]   in taking this step, but also what could come out of it.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.600]   - And also, in a meta way,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.720]   because I was not familiar with this poem,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.640]   it made me curious of the poem itself,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.960]   to pull at that thread of finding out more.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.320]   See, you picked a very particular part
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.680]   that kind of made you want to pull at that thread
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.480]   and see where did this,
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.920]   where did these few lines come from?
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.800]   'Cause I read it as a curiosity of a scientist,
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   those lines alone, and also as a desperate human being,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:17.320]   searching, like offering himself for an understanding
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.600]   or connection with another human being,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.960]   and then, 'cause I wasn't sure if it's a love poem or not,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.680]   or if it's desperation or if it's curiosity,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.200]   whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   I mean, I don't know, that's gonna stick with me for a while,
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:35.240]   your dark, rich life, and then a few lines in here are just,
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.000]   I mean, those are, I'm gonna just use them
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.200]   as pickup lines at a bar.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.400]   I offer you the memory of a yellow rose
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.880]   seen at sunset years before you were born.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.360]   (laughing)
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.840]   Now, that's a pickup line I've never,
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.440]   if I've ever heard one, anyway, sorry.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   - But this is universal, you know,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.960]   you see it in so many forms of art,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.320]   you know, like, you know, we're in Texas now,
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.040]   you see this in country and Western songs,
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.120]   it's often a list of things,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.600]   like, here's how I describe myself,
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.440]   there's this and there's that,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.320]   and there's the other thing, and here you are,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.920]   these things matter to me,
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.280]   and I hope they matter to you too.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.080]   It's a pretty universal form,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   but he did it in this very artful and very vulnerable way,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.600]   it was both beautiful and you could feel the hurt
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.960]   coming from him too, and that was important.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.600]   The dark stuff too, I offer you my ancestors,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.200]   my dead men, the ghosts that living men
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.440]   have honored in bronze,
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.260]   and talking about two bullets through his lungs,
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.800]   bearded and dead,
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.960]   wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow,
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.320]   my mother's grandfather just 24
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.600]   heading a charge of 300 men in Peru,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.960]   now ghosts on vanished horses.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.080]   So all of it, the whole history of it.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.640]   Since it is a love poem,
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.920]   what do you think about love, Carl?
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.600]   What's the role of love in the human condition?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.640]   We'll talk about the dark stuff,
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.920]   but maybe love is the dark stuff too.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.960]   - I mean, it's the most powerful connection we can form,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.260]   and that's what makes it so important to us.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.260]   It's the strongest and most stable connection
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.680]   that we can form with another person,
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.880]   and that matters immensely.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.400]   It matters for the human family to have evolved
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.200]   to be something that could survive against the odds
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.680]   that we've faced over the years,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   of that unreasonable bond that becomes reasonable
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.740]   by virtue of its own existence,
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:43.580]   and of course, that joy, the wild, raw joy of love
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.680]   is not a bad thing either.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.560]   So you put these together,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.640]   the strongest bridge we can form,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.360]   and the reward and the joy that it brings,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   that's what love is to me.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.360]   And from my perspective, this is something that,
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.040]   it can be hard to capture fairly
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   because you wanna talk about the positive
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.080]   and the negative sides at once.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.360]   They need to be wrapped up together
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.680]   for a full, honest description of what it is,
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.640]   and that's hard to do in a compact form.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.360]   And so you have to take time to talk about love.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.600]   You have to take time to do it justice.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.480]   It takes a book or at least a poem.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.440]   - Or several thousands of them.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.640]   I don't know, Sergei, could you pull up,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.980]   there's a video I saw, yeah, like right here.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.520]   So can you pause for a second?
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.200]   So this is March of the Penguins.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.120]   So you always see penguins huddling together against,
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.320]   I mean, sorry if I see just metaphors and everything,
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.920]   but them huddling together against the harshness
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.160]   of the conditions around them.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.680]   That's very kind of, that's like a metaphor for life,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.520]   like finding this connection.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.240]   That's kind of what love is.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.120]   It's like it allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.760]   whatever the suffering of life is,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.720]   together you get to like huddle for warmth.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.520]   And that's why I love the sort of just the honesty
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.120]   and the intensity of the way penguins
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.200]   just in the middle of like the cold do this.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.920]   And then this video I saw, a lonely,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   this is misinformation.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.880]   So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.040]   I don't know if he's deranged.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.280]   So if you play it, so he left his pack
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.800]   and there's a nice like voiceover,
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.640]   you don't need to play it, but he, for some reason,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.800]   left the pack and journeyed out into the mountains.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.720]   And so the narrator says that he's deranged,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.480]   he's lost his mind.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.680]   Now I'd like to project the idea that he's actually,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.920]   there's so many stories you could think of.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.160]   He's returning to his homeland.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.320]   He's an outsider thinking, journeying out into the unknown,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.160]   thinking he may be able to discover
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.080]   something greater than the tribe.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.640]   He might be looking for a lost love.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.680]   Why is he deranged immediately?
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.000]   Why has he lost his mind?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.960]   Anyway, but this, people should look up this video
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.920]   'cause to me, I might be the only one
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   who romanticizes this, but it's such a nice kind of,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.800]   it's both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder,
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.880]   which is what the video kind of describes,
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.920]   and it may be some deeper explanation
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   that has to do with the motivation of a mind.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.480]   Yeah, I don't know if you have a deeper analysis
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.320]   on this penguin.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.120]   - Well, I, like you-- - As a psychiatrist.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.040]   - I would wanna sit down with a penguin
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.440]   and go through, I wanna see the notes
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.440]   from his prior therapist, but this actually is relevant.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.640]   Not knowing what was that penguin's motivation,
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.280]   we have very clear situations where there are,
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.840]   both within an individual, we go through periods of time
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.720]   when we stay in one place and we reap the benefits
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.760]   from what we've built, and then we go through periods
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.280]   of foraging, of wandering.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.160]   Even if there may be resources where we are,
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.240]   we have periods of time in our lives where we wander,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.680]   where we go in an exploratory mode,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.520]   and different people express that trait in different ways.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.840]   This is not a human-specific trait.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.560]   If you go down to the tiny little nematode worm,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.740]   C. elegans, with 302 nervous system cells,
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.200]   they go through these phases of foraging and rest,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.560]   and different individuals have different propensity
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.920]   to forage or to rest and stay in one place.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.560]   At the level of the species, that's really good,
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   that there's that diversity in their willingness to forage.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.920]   Some stay where they are, the species is somewhat
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.960]   on a firm footing then, but some carry a burden,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.160]   a risk for themselves, but it's good for the species
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.600]   that they're explorers and they will venture out.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.200]   The migration patterns that different species blunder into
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.760]   and that turn out to be really good,
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.280]   they weren't logically derived.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.240]   They most certainly started from something like this,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   an exploration.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.360]   - And humans do this too, you think?
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.440]   - And we do it too.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.880]   In fact, it's something we do extremely well.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.040]   - Let's talk about psychiatry a little bit.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.920]   So in my book, you're a rock star.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.080]   First of all, for people who don't know,
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   aside from sort of the neurological view of the brain
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.200]   and neuroscience view of the brain,
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   you're also one of the great psychiatrists of our time.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.760]   I've always, not always, but when I was younger,
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.680]   I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.360]   So it's like getting to meet your heroes
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.480]   and also getting to meet the people who,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   the best at the top of the world
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.560]   at the thing you've failed to pursue.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.240]   So there's, I'm getting a free therapy session
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   on top of that.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.480]   Okay, so what, big picture, what is the practice,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.880]   the goal, the hope of modern psychiatry?
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.800]   If you could try to describe the discipline as you see it,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.080]   maybe historically throughout the 20th century
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.520]   in contrasting to what it is today,
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.480]   or maybe if you want to describe
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.600]   to what you hope psychiatry becomes
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.720]   or longs to become in the 21st century.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.360]   - Yeah, it's been an interesting journey.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.960]   in neurology and pathology.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.260]   Some of the initial founders effectively of the field
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.220]   were very well grounded in microscopy, looking at cells,
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.520]   working with patients, particularly on the neurological side
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.280]   and this certainly included Freud
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.840]   and some of his contemporaries.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.760]   And, but they rapidly discovered that
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.000]   what they could work with at the level of cells
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.400]   and microscopy was so far from the realm
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.560]   of what they could get from a human being.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.120]   And what they were getting from the human being
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.480]   was so much more interesting and had,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.520]   was so mysterious and so unknown that many of them
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.200]   just said, we're gonna inhabit this domain
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   and we're gonna work with the people with their words
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.040]   and understand what we can based on verbal communication
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.520]   because that was the only tool that people really had.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   And that was a very important step for the field.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.180]   I would say one of the interesting things
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.600]   that came from the early decades of psychiatry
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.520]   really was this distinction between the conscious
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:50.120]   and the unconscious mind and paying particular attention
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.840]   to the unconscious mind as something
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.040]   that was worthy of consideration,
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.640]   that might be important in explaining people's actions
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.420]   and that perhaps even insight into that
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.640]   was valuable in its own right.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.600]   And out of that psychoanalysis became a practice
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   that was not always focused on cures or treatment,
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.240]   but was more focused on insight.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.400]   What does it mean?
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.360]   How can we help people understand
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.920]   why they're feeling something or thinking something
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.200]   or dreaming something?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.720]   And that insight, separate even from treatment,
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.480]   was an interesting thing as long as one was honest
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.160]   about that and said, we're going for understanding,
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.400]   we're going for insight.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.840]   - Maybe it's useful to just pause on that.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.760]   If we look at the father of psychoanalysis,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   Sigmund Freud, what do you make of the ideas that he had?
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.880]   So you mentioned taking the unconscious,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.360]   the subconscious seriously.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.900]   That's like step one.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.220]   Like that there could be worlds
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.880]   we do not have direct access for
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.920]   and we probe at them through conversation.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.080]   Is that too simplistic to call psychoanalysis conversation?
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.200]   - That's not too simplistic, but that's right.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.640]   And I think that was valuable.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.020]   Where Freud ended up breaking
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.320]   from some of his contemporaries,
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.280]   he was very focused on this unconscious
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.720]   as being so tightly linked to libido.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.880]   And really, from his perspective,
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.840]   you couldn't really separate the operation
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.000]   of the unconscious mind from these aspects,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.160]   the libidinous aspects.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.000]   And that was one reason.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.840]   - What's the libidinous aspect?
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.140]   - You know, sexually related drives.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.080]   Carl Jung, who was his contemporary,
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.200]   that's one factor that led to them separating
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.440]   was Carl Jung felt there was a lot more to the unconscious
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.680]   than this libidinous aspect of it.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.840]   And he saw it as a much more complete
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.880]   alternate representation of the conscious self,
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.480]   one that maybe reflected a whole range
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.340]   of different motivations and desires.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:04.760]   And to properly treat it, one had to consider all of them
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.520]   rather than the ones that Freud was focused on.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.360]   - Carl Jung, your point.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.800]   - Thank you.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.320]   - Thank you for the high level of images
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.360]   that Sergei is pulling out.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.480]   For people who are just listening,
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.920]   he pulled up a, as a quote from Sigmund Freud's meme,
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.400]   your mom, quote Freud.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.720]   So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow,
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.680]   encompasses everything, not just the desire
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.600]   to have sex with your mother or sex, period.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.320]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.120]   - If you look at those two folks en masse,
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.680]   I mean, there's a kind of, it's almost like a technique
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.560]   for philosophical exploration of human mind,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.320]   human motivations.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.960]   So it's not even like necessarily,
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.720]   it also doubles as a methodology for helping people.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.960]   But it's almost like a,
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.920]   it's a kind of philosophical method.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.080]   - Right.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.720]   This is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.840]   And even though it's, I would say,
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.360]   mostly not considered a treatment today,
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.760]   it persists for a couple of reasons.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.840]   One is it's thought that it gives people some insight.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.960]   But second, there's been a huge influence on literature,
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.500]   on philosophy, on art, and the opening up of discussion
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.560]   about what was below our conscious mind
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.720]   was so fertile in the implications
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.680]   that it sort of reverberated and still does
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.120]   throughout all these different realms of human endeavor,
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   from different artistic experiences that people have
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:49.960]   can be colored by this concept of the unconscious.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.720]   Now, the other thing that was interesting
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.060]   is this distinction,
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.720]   what are the parts of the unconscious?
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.720]   And so there were these id and ego and superego subdivisions
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.520]   that Freud, for example, would talk about them.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.080]   And the id was the primary, the primal drives
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.480]   that an infant would have, or that a very young child,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.840]   just warmth and feeding, and then later,
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.520]   the sexual or libidinous aspects.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.180]   - And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.880]   (Luke laughs)
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.660]   That's the controversial thing about him.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.440]   I think, I guess he thought like even children
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.840]   had sexual desires that they're like dealing with,
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.360]   contending with, so it's the full thing.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.640]   Hungry, wanting to eat, wanting to poop,
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.920]   wanting to have sex.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.660]   - Yeah, and he was extremely focused on that aspect.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.280]   But then there was the superego,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.080]   which brought on these later sort of moralistic
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:54.280]   sort of codes of conduct, and that, of course,
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.200]   was very often in tension.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.560]   But all this could play out subconsciously.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.800]   And then the ego, this third aspect, was mediating,
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.680]   and Freud's conception mediated this tension
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.320]   between the different parts.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.480]   Now, I think that's interesting.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   I will say that in some ways, it's maybe unnecessary
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.080]   from the perspective of modern neuroscience
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:28.120]   and the primal gratification drives.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.960]   In some ways, they're all drives,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.280]   and maybe they're even all primal drives.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   You know, the moralistic drives, they're taught,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.880]   back to survival, and you could even say selfish aspects
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.520]   of health and life for the self and family.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.600]   And so this is, I think it's maybe
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.440]   an artificial distinction.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.240]   The concept of the unconscious is very valuable
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.800]   and very interesting, but these categorizations
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:05.880]   of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.320]   in any particular way.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.520]   If there's a town hall of competing drives and desires,
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.720]   and they interrelate to each other,
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.040]   they involve different aspects of the brain
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.240]   and the history of the person, and actions and choices
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.440]   come out of the result of that overall shouting
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   in the town hall.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.200]   - So in some sense, Carl Jung was a step
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.000]   into the direction of liberating yourself
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.280]   from such harsh categorizations.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.240]   Do you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.400]   with system one and system two.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.480]   There's just these very compelling categorizations
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.200]   of the human mind that seem to be sticky
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.520]   in the superego, no, in how we talk
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.680]   about these ideas and so on.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.480]   Do you think those are helpful or do they get in the way?
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.880]   Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.360]   of how the mind actually works?
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.680]   - You know, it's from modern neuroscience,
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:07.880]   whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.980]   like this at the level of cells,
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.160]   it seems to get farther away, and I'll give you an example
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.740]   of what I mean by that.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.760]   So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.720]   and many people are doing is we are listening in
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.600]   on the activity of cells, neurons, in the brain of mice
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.680]   or rats or fish or monkeys.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.520]   - Individual cells.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.200]   - Individual cells, exactly, of which there are,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.240]   you know, in our brain, many billions.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.280]   And when we do and we try to predict
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.380]   what action will be taken by an animal,
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.640]   to address this question, where does the choice arise?
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.080]   Where does the impetus to make a particular selection
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.780]   of one action versus another action,
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.060]   where does that start in the brain?
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.960]   If you're recording, listening in on the activity of cells
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.680]   all across the brain, where's the earliest spot
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.640]   you can pick up a choice being made?
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.120]   Well-- - That's so awesome.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.640]   - Yeah, at one level, you might think how excited
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.160]   would Jung have been to see this or Freud
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.640]   or the early psychoanalysts to see where this starts,
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.840]   but it's not so simple because an emerging theme
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.160]   in very recent neuroscience,
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.640]   literally over the last few years,
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.220]   is that things sort of all start together,
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.400]   all across the brain.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.080]   And so you can be recording from the cortex,
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.880]   this rim of cells at the surface of the brain,
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.360]   or you can be recording deeper in a structure
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.920]   called the striatum, which is a little older,
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.380]   it's more tightly linked to action,
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.300]   and then structures called the thalamus,
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.660]   other parts of the brain.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.040]   And if you record from these,
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   these all sort of represent the action and the choice
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.320]   more or less all at about the same time, very close.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.200]   And so you can't point to a particular spot
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.160]   and say, here's where the choice or the action originates.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.640]   It's a group-- - Is this a
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.620]   finding the free will neuron?
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.120]   - It's relevant to that question.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.840]   - Well, close is a relative term.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.160]   And nobody, what I tweet today,
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.880]   all generalizations are wrong.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   (both laughing)
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.200]   So including this one.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.280]   Let's actually talk about that.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.360]   So the study of individual cells,
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.920]   if you could linger on your sense
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.480]   that as you get closer to that understanding,
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.080]   it feels like you're getting farther away.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.040]   Why is that?
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   'Cause that often is the feeling
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.600]   until you're actually there.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.680]   So like, you know,
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.880]   see that's when I'm running
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.960]   and I know there's only a mile left,
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.920]   it just feels like that mile
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.040]   is just getting longer and longer,
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.160]   but eventually you finish.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.800]   So maybe we're getting close
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.520]   to cracking open these beginnings of a sense,
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.160]   like we'll talk about consciousness
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.880]   or these very difficult, big questions about the human mind.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.360]   Where do they start?
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.680]   - You're right to say we shouldn't generalize
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.400]   or make absolutist statements.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.160]   But I would say right now,
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.860]   the reason things are looking even harder to crack
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.720]   than we had initially thought,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.400]   we now have the data streams
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.160]   that we've wanted for so long
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.240]   in terms of activity patterns all across the brain
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   at the level of cells.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.640]   We can literally see what cells are doing.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240]   Immense data sets, you know,
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.080]   we get, these are time series of one individual cell
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   with sub-second resolution
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.360]   and you can collect this from enormous numbers
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.080]   of cells across the brain.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.880]   So very rich data sets that we've wanted for a long time
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.560]   and yet having these has not led
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.520]   to an understanding of truly where actions initiate
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.960]   in terms of regions or locations.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.160]   - Can I ask you a few questions on that?
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.160]   Is the answer, high level question by your intuition,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.640]   is the answer within the data
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.600]   or do we need different kind of data?
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.920]   So we should also say that when you collect data
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.680]   about the brain,
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.600]   there's like the richness of information you're collecting
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   but there's also a human doing stuff.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.320]   Like, and the information,
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.960]   so static information about the human
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.480]   and dynamic information about the human
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.320]   and you can get them to do different stuff
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.440]   and you can select different humans
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.680]   and that's part of the collection of data aspects.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.440]   So like when you're collecting data about the brain,
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.360]   there's some truths that you can,
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.200]   you know, in machine learning,
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.680]   it's like annotations, like supervised learning,
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.080]   there's some true things you can hold onto
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.040]   before you look at the full rich mess complexity
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.600]   of the human mind.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.080]   So given the data you've looked at,
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.040]   do you think the answer for the origin of free will
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.640]   in the human mind can be found?
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:03.120]   - Well, one amazing thing is that nobody's found it
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.880]   but we have these rich data sets
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.920]   and then there's a conundrum which is,
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.080]   is it in the data and we just don't know how to look at it?
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.720]   Maybe we don't know the right scale,
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.760]   the right projection to make of the data,
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.720]   the right way to interpret it.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.240]   And here's where causal testing becomes very valuable
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.780]   'cause then instead of just passively observing,
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:28.360]   well, here are the activity patterns
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.560]   and then here's the choice made by the animal
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.000]   as we've gotten more powerful at reaching in
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.960]   and causing things to happen in the brain,
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.120]   turning up or down the activity of certain types of cells
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.400]   or defined populations of cells
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.360]   and seeing how that affects actions.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.880]   These causal perturbations have turned out
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.440]   to be very valuable.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.200]   We're just now getting to the point
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.440]   at cellular resolution and so we're gonna be able,
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.240]   hopefully to make some headway on this question
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.880]   with causality and those,
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.720]   that's the one thing that optogenetics provides us,
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.160]   this way of using light that we develop to control cells.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   This is relatively untapped at this broad brain-wide scale
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.880]   and hopefully we can get there in the near future.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.640]   But I would say that the answer may be in the data
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.360]   but we don't know how to find it.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.000]   - Well, there's this interactive element
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.680]   like where you can cause stuff that's really powerful
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.560]   because you get to, I mean,
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.800]   as opposed to collecting data passively,
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.240]   you're collecting data actively.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.400]   So can you maybe describe one of the many things
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.960]   you're known for, one of the big things
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.560]   is called optogenetics, what is it?
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.160]   - Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.240]   It's a way of determining what actually matters
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.200]   in terms of the activity of the brain
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.040]   for the amazing things it does,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.440]   sensation, cognition, action.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.720]   And what it does is it provides activity.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.320]   It's a way of playing in, if you will,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.520]   activity patterns into precisely defined cells.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.720]   And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.800]   Right away there's a problem if you think about
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.620]   how do we do this?
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.360]   How could we play in well-defined activity patterns
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.100]   and provide a stream of activity into this cell
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.680]   and that cell and that cell but not these other cells?
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.920]   - But just for context, we're talking about the brains
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   of mice, monkeys, humans,
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.880]   and then the goal is to try to control accurately
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.280]   the behavior of a single neuron
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.640]   and then to be able to monitor
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.040]   single collection of single neurons
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.080]   to then say, well, to draw some deeper insight
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.960]   about the origins, first of all,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.280]   the function of different parts of the brain,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.960]   different neurons, different kinds of neurons,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.400]   but also the origins of the big things,
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.080]   the flap of the butterfly wing that leads
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.480]   to an actual behavioral thing.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.960]   - Yeah, so if you could, exactly.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.280]   So if you could turn on or off the brain
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.800]   or parts of the brain or cell types or individual cells
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.400]   at the natural rate and rhythm and timing
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.800]   of normal brain activity, that would be immensely valuable
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.480]   because you could determine what actually mattered,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.880]   what could cause complex things to happen
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.960]   and what could prevent complex things from happening
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.700]   in a specific way.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.860]   But right away you've got a problem if you wanna do this.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.240]   And neuroscientists have wanted to do this for a long time.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.280]   Francis Crick of double helix of DNA fame,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.520]   he wrote a famous paper in 1999.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.080]   He got interested in neuroscience later in life
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.720]   and he said, what we need in neuroscience
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.760]   is a way that we could turn on or off
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.600]   the activity of individual types of neurons
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.420]   in a behaving animal.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.200]   And he even said the ideal signal would be light
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.580]   because it would be fast, it could penetrate
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.720]   through the brain to some extent.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.800]   And he had no idea how to do it.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.620]   He said this would probably be very far-fetched
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.480]   but it would be a good thing.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.260]   - And so that's what you're actually saying.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.280]   If you wanna do this kind of thing,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.780]   and then you imagine, how do I get inside the brain?
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.560]   It's pretty difficult.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.400]   - It's pretty difficult.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.080]   And then even once you get in, it's hard
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.160]   because all brain cells are electrical.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.440]   All neurons are electrically activated.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.880]   And so if you wanted to use electricity
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.300]   as what you were putting in,
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.480]   you won't have any specificity at all.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.340]   If you have an electrode, a wire,
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   and you put it in the brain and you send current through it,
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.260]   all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.140]   - That's like trying to control fish
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.660]   by spraying them with water.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.000]   - Yeah, right.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.280]   Because there's already a lot of electricity
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.440]   going around anyway.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.280]   And you're adding more.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.800]   But there's no specificity,
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.540]   even among the different kinds of cells either.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.020]   Because all around the wire that you've put in,
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.800]   there are gonna be so many different cells
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.520]   doing totally different things.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520]   Many of them in opposition to each other.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.240]   We know that's one way the brain is set up.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.000]   There are parts of the brain where neurons side by side
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.360]   are doing completely different things
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.240]   and maybe even antagonistic to each other.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.080]   So what do you do?
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.680]   How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.440]   Well, what you do is use,
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.040]   what we found is what you can do
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:33.040]   is make some cells responsive to light.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.720]   Now, normally no cells deep in the brain
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.640]   really respond to light.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.120]   They're not built for that.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.360]   There's no reason for them to respond to light in there.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.240]   Which is a great situation to start with
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.960]   because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.560]   will be a huge signal above the noise.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.520]   And so that's what we do with optogenetics.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   We take genes, bits of DNA from microbes,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.800]   single-celled organisms.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.080]   And these single-celled organisms like algae,
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.360]   they make little proteins
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.960]   that sit in the surface of their cells
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.240]   that receive light, capture a photon of light,
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.400]   and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.840]   and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.440]   flow across the membrane of the cell.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   And that, these algae and bacteria,
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.760]   they do this for their own reasons
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.280]   because that helps them move,
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.880]   it helps them make and use energy.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.560]   But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.400]   because movement of ions,
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.680]   charged particles across the membrane of the cell
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.960]   is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.260]   So if we can take this bit of DNA
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.780]   that encodes this beautiful protein
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.440]   that turns light into electricity from algae,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.600]   and if we can put it into some neurons,
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.880]   but not other neurons,
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.200]   which we can do using genetic tricks,
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.440]   then you've got a situation,
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.240]   then you can shine on the light,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.900]   and only the cells that have the gene
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.760]   and that are expressing the gene
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.160]   will be the initial direct cells
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.200]   that are activated by the light.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.880]   And so that's the essence of optogenetics
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.580]   is the ability to do that.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.080]   We get that initial specificity
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.840]   that you could never get with an electrode.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.280]   - First of all, let me say that this is,
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.560]   we recently got the Lasker Prize for this.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.260]   It's a brilliant idea.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.880]   So I talked to Andrew Huberman,
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.080]   who's a friend of yours, friend of mine,
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.520]   not to jinx things,
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.720]   but he believes that he deserves a Nobel Prize for this.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.800]   So, (laughs)
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.560]   I do too, but what my votes.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.680]   Anyway, the thing is, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.280]   Prizes will be all forgotten.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.480]   All of us will be forgotten.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.920]   When the cool idea is, cool idea is a cool idea.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.640]   It's a really powerful idea.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.800]   - It's actually, the origins of it
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.640]   you might be interested in are even, are very deep.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.880]   There was a botanist in St. Petersburg
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.600]   named Andrei Fomentsen.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.640]   In 1866, he published a paper
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.880]   on the single-celled green algae.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.000]   And he was the botanist who first noticed
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.120]   that they moved in response to light.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.560]   These are tiny single-celled algae that have flagella,
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.500]   so they swim through the water.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.120]   And he noticed this, he was a botanist,
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.560]   and he published this.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.160]   It was a paper, he wrote in German,
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.760]   but he published it in a French journal,
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.680]   and he was doing it from St. Petersburg,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.440]   so it was a very international effort.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.160]   But you have to go back to 1866,
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.120]   and that, I like to highlight how far back
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.880]   that discovery goes, is back to Andrei Fomentsen.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.960]   And this is a, it highlights the value
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.760]   of just pure basic science discovery.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.400]   That always originates somewhere
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.560]   in the Eastern European bloc.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.640]   But I don't think he expected the splicing
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.960]   of genetic material from the algae into the human brain.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.480]   - And one of the cool things we've been able to do now
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.080]   with modern methods is to really study these proteins.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.320]   And so we've discovered some of these proteins,
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.520]   other groups have as well.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.680]   We've dived deep into their structure,
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.960]   just like the double helix structure of DNA
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.580]   was uncovered with X-ray crystallography.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.880]   We used the same method, X-ray crystallography,
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.080]   to see how these beautiful little proteins work.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   We've re-engineered them for all kinds of function.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.360]   We can make them, instead of responding to blue light,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.520]   we can make them respond to red light.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.400]   We can speed them up, slow them down.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.920]   We can make them, with genetic engineering,
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.320]   we can make them have different ions flow through them.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.720]   And so it's this convergence, as you said,
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.920]   like the botanist in 1866 couldn't have predicted
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.440]   what we could do with this.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.680]   And the fact that we've been able to discover
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.240]   how these beautiful proteins work,
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.080]   and then apply them to neuroscience
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.320]   is really a thrilling story.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.480]   - Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this?
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.800]   Meaning, what is the progress of the next 50 years,
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.880]   100 years looks like, in terms of the precision
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.160]   and the scale of control of using light?
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.360]   - It's going so fast, it's hard to predict.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.160]   I'll give you a sense of it, though.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.120]   First paper we published in 2005,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.600]   that was just in cultured neurons, by 2007,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.520]   so that was in a dish.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   By 2007, we had it working in behaving mice.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.800]   By 2009, we had it pretty general,
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.360]   so we had methods to really make it a versatile method,
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.280]   it could be applied to essentially any cell.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.240]   By 2012, we could get to single-cell resolution,
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.120]   we used light guidance strategies
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   to target individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.100]   individually specified single cells in the brain of a mouse,
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.220]   and in ways that specifically changed its behavior,
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.620]   that could bias its decisions one way or the other.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.420]   In fact, we could take a mouse,
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.980]   and without any visual stimulus at all,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.740]   we could make it act as if it had seen
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.900]   a particular visual stimulus by playing in,
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.580]   using the single-cell resolution optogenetics,
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.020]   a specific pattern of activity into 20 or 25
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.900]   individually specified cells.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.500]   That's 2019.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.660]   To your question of scale, now in 2022,
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.340]   we're controlling hundreds of
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.820]   individually specified single cells
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.840]   over all the visual cortex of a mouse,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.120]   all the part of the brain that is the initial
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.140]   direct target of the incoming information from the retina.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:34.300]   - Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.780]   Like you mentioned, long range is easier.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.700]   Is there constraints on which cells?
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.020]   - Now, there really isn't.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.580]   Now that we have this individual cell guidance,
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:47.420]   we can target any individual kind of cell very reliably.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.080]   And so now, to your question of scale,
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.500]   how far can we go?
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.660]   Well, things are moving quickly.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.060]   It's hard to say.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.660]   We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.780]   If you look 10, 20 years in the future,
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.900]   I think we'll surprise ourselves.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.580]   But the fact that we're already able to cause
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.580]   specific perceptions to happen and specific actions
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.480]   means we're essentially where we wanna be.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.300]   And now it's a matter of just
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.820]   more experiments, more discoveries.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.960]   But the basic principles are clear now.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.180]   The basic capability is there.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:36.300]   - Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.380]   - Optogenetics is primarily, it's a discovery tool
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.780]   that really is well suited for use in mice and rats
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.720]   and monkeys because it's,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.700]   it involves putting in a gene and also delivering light.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.620]   And those are two things that you can do in human beings,
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.740]   but you'd wanna do in a very careful way.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:59.220]   Now, that said, there is actually just less than a year ago,
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.420]   my friend, Botan Raska in Switzerland,
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.820]   he did the first human optogenetics therapy.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.000]   And he published this in the journal Nature Medicine.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.420]   So about 10, 12 years ago,
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.780]   he and I published a paper together where
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.900]   we gave him one of our optogenetic tools,
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.060]   one of these light-activated regulators of ion flow.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.940]   These are called microbial opsins, by the way, opsins.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.140]   And he put one of those into an extracted retina
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.740]   from a human being who had died.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.820]   So it was a cadaveric retina.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.620]   And he was able to show that optical control in this paper
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.380]   was able to turn on or off individual cells
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.420]   in the human retina.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.460]   So that was a while back.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.780]   He spent about 10 years of going through
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.500]   all the regulatory hoops and hurdles
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.460]   and going through primate studies.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.540]   And finally, he was able to take a human being
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.940]   with a retinal degeneration syndrome,
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.220]   so someone who was blind in both eyes.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.880]   And he gave one of these opsins
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.020]   into one eye of this human being who was blind
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:18.500]   and with the goal of conferring light sensitivity
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.480]   onto this retina that was not able to see light.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.460]   And he was able to make this person see through that eye.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.960]   So he took a blind person, and the blind person could see,
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.500]   now could reach for objects selectively on a table.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.400]   And he published this in Nature Medicine.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.640]   And it was, you know, that's an amazing thing.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.520]   - Do you know the title of the paper?
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520]   What's his name again?
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.880]   - Roska, R-O-S-K-A.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.440]   - And you look up the Nature paper.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.800]   - Yeah, Nature Medicine.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.720]   - Nature Medicine.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.400]   - So that's sort of proof of principle.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.200]   Now, the retina is very accessible.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.680]   It's near the surface.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.120]   You can use natural light,
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.080]   or you can use brighter natural light.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:02.000]   I'm, myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.420]   It's a way to figure out the principles
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.800]   by which the brain works and how it operates.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.600]   - Partial recovery of visual function
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.200]   in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.440]   So he went through the full process of doing primates,
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.240]   and then going, well, that's dedication,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.120]   and that's really exciting to see.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.640]   - As beautiful as that is,
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.960]   and I'm glad he did all that work,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.320]   there are so many other ways
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.560]   that optogenetics could help with therapies.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.400]   Once you know the principles,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.880]   then any kind of therapy can become more powerful.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.720]   Once you know the causal cells in a symptom,
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.240]   like in lack of motivation, or inability to enjoy things,
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.980]   or altered sleep, or altered energy,
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.080]   once you know the cells that are causal,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.640]   then you can make medications that address those cells.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.240]   You could address brain stimulation treatments
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.440]   that might address those cells.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.640]   - Also diagnosis.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.880]   - Diagnosis.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.680]   - Very effective, systematic way of diagnosing,
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.380]   or at least providing you rich data
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.720]   to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.760]   about bipolar, all of those kinds of things that are,
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.680]   the tools are low resolution currently
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.280]   for determining the degree to which you have a thing,
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.080]   and whether you have a thing at all.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.360]   And so the hope is,
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:25.560]   this is a great example of how you can cure,
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.800]   or you can provide some relief for a symptom of a person
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.320]   who has a serious degenerative disease.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.200]   But the principles are what we're after,
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.480]   and that's why I spend, even though I'm a psychiatrist,
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.100]   even though I still see patients,
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.040]   I'm not myself trying to drive
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.420]   any clinical trials in the lab.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.280]   I'm trying to discover,
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.860]   and then any kind of therapy could result from that.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   - What do you think about my friend Elon Musk
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:58.320]   and his efforts with Neuralink?
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.620]   So this is another,
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.820]   there's a lot of things to say here,
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.420]   because there's a lot of ideas
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.280]   under the umbrella of Neuralink.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.640]   But one of them is to use electrical signals to stimulate,
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.240]   and then you also record,
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.820]   you collect electrical signals from the brain
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.880]   at a higher and higher resolution,
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.240]   and you go implant surgically
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.360]   the methods by which you do the stimulation
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.400]   and the data collection.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.480]   So it's possible for the ideas of optogenetics
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.000]   to play well with this.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.640]   And we can even zoom out outside of just Neuralink
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.520]   and just the whole idea of brain-computer interfaces.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.760]   What are your thoughts?
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.600]   - Well, I think the engineering that they've done
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.480]   is actually pretty cool.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.980]   So I like the-- - Robots.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.500]   - Yeah, from the design perspective,
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.220]   and it was a design approach
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.560]   that wasn't being taken in academia.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.760]   And it's great that they did it,
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.420]   and I think it's pretty cool.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.980]   So I'll say that.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:01.540]   Also, there are many ways that you can record
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.840]   from many thousands of neurons.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.980]   That's not the only way.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.000]   It's a very interesting way.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.420]   We and others are using brain-penetrating electrodes
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.820]   that actually get quite deep.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.160]   The whole structure of the brain is very interesting.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.840]   There's the surface cortex,
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.920]   where it's the most recently emergent part of the brain
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.640]   in evolution.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.680]   Mammals have it.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.980]   Reptiles have something a little bit like it,
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.940]   but it's not really the full thing.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.040]   This is a very recent thing.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.600]   That's what we can access with some of these,
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.080]   like the Neuralink approach
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.280]   and with some of these short electrodes.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.480]   This part of the brain, the cortex,
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.680]   is only a few millimeters thick.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.880]   There's so much that's deep, though, that's so important.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.680]   There's the striatum, there's the thalamus.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.140]   They're the parts of the brain that drive motivation,
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:52.960]   that drive hunger and thirst and social interaction
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.960]   and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.440]   All these things are, there's so much that's deep
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.800]   that these surface approaches are not getting to.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.620]   And so we and others are using these very long electrodes
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.920]   that help us get deep.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.440]   And we can still record from many cells,
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.580]   many thousands of cells.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.340]   We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.440]   And so there's a diversity of methods to get to this goal.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.240]   I think it's great that people coming from
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.740]   outside academia will bring ideas
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.040]   that weren't being worked on, at least approaches.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.160]   They may turn out to be synergistic.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.600]   These things do work very well with optogenetics
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.400]   because all these electrical recording methods,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.640]   that's one channel of information flow.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.220]   Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.380]   There can be some artifacts that happen,
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.200]   but if you're careful,
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.820]   that's another independent pathway of information flow.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.160]   And we've done really fun experiments in mice
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.260]   where we play in patterns of activity with light
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.720]   and we record activity from all across the brain
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.140]   of a mouse electrically.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.320]   And so using optical and electrical together
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.980]   is extremely powerful.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:08.260]   - So like optoelectric brain computer interfaces.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.080]   Which, by the way, there's efforts on the computing side
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.200]   to build optoelectric servers.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.920]   So like where you have both electricity.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.160]   So because optics is really interesting.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.880]   Light is a very interesting method of communication
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.240]   that's, like you said, orthogonal in many ways.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.940]   It doesn't have some of the constraints of bandwidth
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.400]   that electricity does, going through wires,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.320]   but you're able to,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.660]   but less ability to control precisely at scale.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.700]   So there's challenges and there's benefits
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.860]   and having those two interplays really, really,
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.060]   really fascinating.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.660]   Especially when obviously on the other side
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:51.300]   of your signal is a biological mesh,
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.700]   mush, mushy mesh.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.700]   - Well, the mushy mesh is kind of interesting
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.460]   'cause we have, there are problems with light.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.060]   Light scatters in the brain,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.660]   so the photons don't just go linearly through.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.360]   Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.080]   lipid and water, they bounce off in different directions.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.960]   And so you can come in with all the resolution you want.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:14.680]   You could play in an incredibly detailed,
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.560]   high resolution pattern of light,
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.400]   but the photons start scattering quite quickly
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.160]   and by the time you've gone a couple of millimeters deep,
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.480]   you've lost almost all that fine spatial information.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.920]   So, but we've developed workarounds.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.080]   The longer wavelength light you use,
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.040]   if you get into the infrared, there's less scattering.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.840]   You can use two photon methods or three photon methods
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.020]   where the photons have to arrive all together
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.500]   at the same time.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.100]   You can put in fiber optics.
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.360]   We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.080]   where you can access these deep structures
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.960]   with fiber optic methods and you can put many
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.680]   of these fiber optics at the same time in an animal.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.320]   We've used holographic methods, 3D holograms
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.920]   to play in hundreds of individual cell-sized spots of light
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.120]   and we can change those quickly.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.360]   And so there are a lot of tricks,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.840]   a lot of interesting optics engineering
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.880]   that has come together with neuroscience
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.720]   in a pretty exciting way.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.080]   - All of it is engineering too,
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.680]   which is super, super, super exciting.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.840]   I should mention, 'cause I remember I mentioned Elon,
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.740]   I recently got, for the first time ever, got COVID.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:22.040]   How did I go so long without, finally,
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.320]   so I'm all vaccinated and everything like that.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.880]   And so I got, 'cause I think he mentioned it publicly
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.640]   so I can mention it, but I won't mention
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.600]   anybody else involved.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.760]   But hanging out, we all got, Elon got COVID.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.200]   And the interesting thing about,
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.520]   maybe you can comment about this.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.860]   So I was only sick for like a half a day.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.560]   I got a fever of like 104, I just went up
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.480]   and then crashed and then I was,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.720]   now maybe I'm just seeing the silver lining of everything,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.720]   but afterwards, I have like a greater clarity
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.560]   about the world.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.760]   - You just think it's greater clarity.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   - Maybe, maybe I just, it was so, maybe so intensely,
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.880]   the mind fog kind of thing for such a short amount of time.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:12.060]   But the people who were involved were also reporting this.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.120]   It's kind of interesting, 'cause like,
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.600]   because I do know, like the immune system
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.840]   is involved with the brain in very interesting ways.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.760]   So like the human mind also incorporates all these other,
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.120]   it's not just the nervous system.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.240]   And I just wonder, 'cause everyone always says,
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.560]   no, not like, everyone always says like COVID
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.760]   does all these bad things or whatever the disease is
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.080]   or whatever the virus.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.760]   But I wonder like, I hate to be a Steven Pinker on this,
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.200]   but like I wonder what the benefits of certain disease are
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.880]   if you're able to recover.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.120]   Like what, is there some like,
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.600]   again, don't wanna romanticize it,
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.200]   but if your system goes to some kind of hardship
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.920]   and you come out on the other end,
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.920]   I wonder sometimes if there's a greater,
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.480]   maybe killed off a bunch of neurons
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   that I didn't need anyway,
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.880]   and they were actually getting in the way.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.600]   They were the hater neurons.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.880]   - Well, that was your inner critic
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.720]   that I was talking about earlier.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.560]   - Exactly.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.040]   - You killed off your critic.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.360]   Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what,
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.440]   the potential mechanisms for what you're talking about.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.280]   There's actually been a fair bit of research
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   on post-COVID neurological function.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.960]   Actually, my wife, Michelle Monge, who's at Stanford,
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.360]   she's done a lot of this work.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.520]   Hiko Iwasaki at Yale has done a lot of this.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.320]   But what they found is that there's a loss of myelin.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.360]   This is the coating of those long-range projections
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.440]   that go from one part of the brain to another.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.560]   Myelin is this sort of insulator
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.240]   that coats these long-range projections
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.200]   and makes the impulses go faster and more reliably.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:48.640]   And there's altered function of the myelin-producing cells
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.680]   and altered myelin in the case of COVID.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.640]   They've looked in both mouse and human brains.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.000]   But of course, it could be very idiosyncratic.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.400]   Many people have cognitive problems post-COVID.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.520]   You're definitely aware of that.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.240]   So many people report this persistent brain fog
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.960]   and inability to function.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.480]   But it depends on where the inflammation was.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.000]   Maybe the people who have dysfunction post-COVID,
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.080]   they had a global effect.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.320]   Maybe you lost some of these projections
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.720]   that were restraining you in some way.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.360]   And these plausibly exist.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.040]   And it's known that there are cell populations
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.220]   in the prefrontal cortex that actively restrain
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:36.400]   deeper structures from expressing what they do.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.060]   And it's theoretically possible that you had a lucky--
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.440]   - Somebody has to get lucky, right?
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.080]   - Somebody has to get lucky, yeah.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.200]   - Why not me?
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.280]   All right, if we can actually go back
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.900]   to this idea of trying, through optogenetics,
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:58.760]   to find origins of when the wave first starts.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:04.640]   Origins of a decision, origin of idea,
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:12.040]   origin of maybe consciousness or the subjective experience,
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.140]   or origin of things in the mind.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:20.140]   So one thing, Carl Jung, is there a God neuron?
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.720]   Is there a belief neuron?
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.560]   So through this methodology of optogenetics,
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.560]   can you start getting where a belief begins
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.360]   or an idea begins?
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:41.040]   And especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.240]   Maybe beliefs of love and hate,
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.240]   but religious belief into something really grand,
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.900]   on the grandest of scale.
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:59.340]   - Neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.800]   We don't have an answer to that.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.320]   - But a lot of these questions I'm gonna ask you,
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.340]   there's no good answer, but you're providing the tools
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.600]   that give us hope to find the answer one day.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.000]   - Yeah, and we have early clues.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.640]   So for example, when patients with epilepsy
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:19.640]   have experiences of religiosity as part of their seizure
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.520]   or the aura before their seizure,
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.600]   very often those are in the temporal lobe,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.280]   in these parts of the brain that are at the side.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.400]   And so that's an initial clue.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.280]   There are also parts of the brain
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   that are involved in the definition of the self
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.680]   and defining the borders or boundaries of the self.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.520]   And we know this,
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.460]   this is some experiments that we did in my lab.
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.120]   There's a part of the brain where if there's a rhythm
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.200]   of a particular type,
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.680]   you can cause a separation of the sense of self
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.780]   from the sense of the body.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.080]   What's normally bound up and unitary,
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.680]   we normally think of ourself and our body
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.820]   as pretty tightly bound up together.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.400]   Those can be separated, it turns out.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.640]   We can't take that for granted.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.720]   And there are certain conditions,
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.580]   certain patterns of activity in one part of the brain
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.840]   called the retrosplenial cortex,
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.920]   where you can actually separate those two out.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.860]   And so if you think about these very big questions,
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.440]   what is, where are the origins of religiosity?
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.160]   Where, how do we define the boundaries of who we are
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.500]   relative to others and to the world?
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:40.480]   How do we link our self to our body
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.120]   and how can that become separated?
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.080]   These are actually, believe it or not,
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.960]   now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively so.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.860]   We did an experiment with optogenetics
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:53.680]   where we provided this abnormal rhythm
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.120]   to this particular part of the mouse brain.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   And we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.640]   and caring about it.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   - So that's like stimulating something
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.240]   about the mouse brain that affects these neurons
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.960]   that give the conception of self.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.400]   So you're able to dissociate the experience
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.960]   from the impact of the experience onto you.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.520]   - That's right, exactly right.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.140]   - So like these are the goals of meditation.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:25.840]   These are the goals whenever I get drunk,
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.320]   pretty much effective.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.000]   I mean, that's not a scientific statement,
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.940]   just an experiential, anecdotal one.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.060]   Also psychedelics seek to attain this kind of state.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.120]   That's so interesting.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.520]   - Well, you mentioned psychedelics,
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.520]   DMT and 5-MeO DMT, these create this religious experience,
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.600]   this connection, people describe them
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.520]   as a strong connection to God.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.400]   In theory, these are accessible with modern methods.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.240]   Now that we have these rich recording methods,
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.240]   we can explore what are the precise millisecond resolution,
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:05.300]   cellular resolution, brain-wide manifestations
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.660]   of these altered states.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:11.040]   - So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT,
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.560]   record it across many people,
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.020]   and then from there see where do these experiences
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.580]   originate in the brain in terms of single neurons,
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:25.280]   and then how do they propagate
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.560]   and interact with everything else,
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.000]   and if there's some kind of common signal.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.360]   Like how do you narrow down the set of neurons
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.740]   that are responsible for a particular experience
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.720]   or for a particular behavioral effect?
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.480]   - Yeah, here's where optogenetics is so useful
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   because anytime you give an agent like ketamine or PCP,
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:49.520]   which we used for our dissociation experiments
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.600]   that I was mentioning, or you have a psychedelic,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.600]   LSD or DMT for this altered perceptual state,
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.600]   if you give either of those,
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.040]   these change everything across the brain, okay?
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.080]   So just the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse,
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.100]   let's say, or eventually to a human,
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:13.680]   you won't know yet which cells to home in on
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.200]   as the causal players in all this
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.400]   just by recording the activity.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.920]   But then what we found is that optogenetics
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.800]   providing a causal pattern of activity
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.040]   guided by what you see can let you test hypotheses.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.200]   And we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.920]   for dissociation, and then we said,
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.880]   okay, let's test what's causal.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.120]   We came in and provided that rhythm.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.520]   We tried a few different things,
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.920]   but only one of the causal tests we tried
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.120]   actually caused the behavioral dissociation.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.320]   And so that's how we home in on what actually matters.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.280]   - And is it repeatable once you see the,
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.280]   so that's one definition of causality
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.120]   is like you try and it repeats across different mice
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.080]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:56.920]   - Exactly.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.960]   - And so you could do that for DMT.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.160]   You could do that for the really fascinating
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.440]   mind-expanding, thank you.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.280]   (laughs)
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.360]   Thank you for the, so the meme for people just listening,
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.160]   this is, again, another disagreement
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:13.440]   between Freud and Carl Jung.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.120]   Religion and spirituality.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.000]   This is the, I guess, the ring scene
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.880]   from "Lord of the Rings."
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.800]   Religion and spirituality, Freud says,
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.440]   cast it into the fire, destroy it.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.240]   Carl Jung says, no.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.560]   So for people who don't know,
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:31.520]   Sergei is the Slavic Lord of the meme.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.760]   Thank you, I appreciate that.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.360]   So what we're talking about, so there is,
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.400]   I mean, I think a connection between DMT
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.320]   and religious experiences are some of these psychedelics.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.840]   Do you think it's possible to
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:47.280]   sort of stimulate religious experiences?
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.040]   And so religious experiences are one of the most
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.560]   deep kind of experiences.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.080]   And so here you could first understand
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.040]   where they originate, how they propagate
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.880]   through the brain, and then to stimulate them.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:06.720]   - And so this is, and these can happen
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.640]   in people who had no predisposition.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:13.120]   You know, people who are, you know,
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.880]   as agnostic or atheistic as you'd like,
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.080]   they can have these, they can feel connected to God
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.120]   in these states.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.960]   Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating these.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.720]   We don't know what's safe in human beings,
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.920]   but we definitely-- - Yet.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.920]   - Not yet.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.520]   But we definitely can do these experiments in mice,
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.280]   and that was already very productive
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.680]   in understanding dissociation.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.320]   So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.440]   And then, you know, I had a,
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.960]   and this does map onto the non-psychedelic human experience.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.680]   I had a patient who's actually described
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.240]   in the book, "Projections."
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.680]   This was the patient that's in the mania chapter,
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.560]   the bipolar chapter.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.280]   Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.320]   or symptom in his life.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.480]   He was a retirement age gentleman,
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.840]   and nobody in his family either.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.960]   So no family history, no personal history
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   of any psychiatric illness,
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.760]   and he had never been religious, particularly, before either.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.280]   Certainly no passionate, you know, type of religion.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.840]   But he, not through any psychedelic or drug,
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.040]   he had a stressful experience,
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.640]   actually a post-9/11 change in how he was thinking,
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.880]   and he was pushed into a mania, a manic state,
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.760]   revealing that he had bipolar,
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.600]   never before known in this case, in this person.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.920]   And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar,
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.040]   included this profound religiosity,
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.200]   which he had never had before.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.200]   And he was, you know, preaching in a elevated,
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.120]   you know, vigorous way to his family.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.000]   And so this state can be created in people,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.520]   even late in life, who had no predisposition for it,
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.960]   and no, even without a neurochemical.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.360]   So there's, the causality of that
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.760]   is very interesting to explore.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:05.760]   How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.560]   But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.680]   OCD can manifest as religiosity also.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.140]   You can take people who never really had a,
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:18.480]   a religion never played a powerful role in their life,
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.120]   but then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.160]   become severe, they can manifest in this.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:24.320]   - I think I'm in that group.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.320]   So I'm a bit OCD.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.720]   We have, there's, I think there's subreddits,
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.840]   when there's oddly satisfying things.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.960]   So there's certain things that are really satisfying
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.600]   to my OCD, like my mild OCD.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.000]   I think it's pretty much a religious experience.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000]   (laughs)
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.960]   So I understand that there's,
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.360]   if it's not direct, it's at least rhymes.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.840]   So maybe can you speak to the,
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.720]   as Sergey's probably desperately scrambling
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.020]   to pull up oddly satisfying, thank you.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.280]   People can check it out themselves.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.740]   It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:08.000]   Can we talk about bipolar and maybe depression?
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.160]   Well, let's talk about, I mean,
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:12.160]   I don't know if there's a nice way
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.960]   to discuss the differences in the full landscape
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   of suffering that's here, but maybe what is depression?
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.240]   And what are the types of depression?
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.320]   What kind of depression have you seen,
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.480]   experienced, and researched?
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.280]   And how can people overcome it?
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.560]   How can humans overcome it and deal with it,
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.060]   live with it, and overcome it?
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:38.940]   - So this is my clinical specialty.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:42.000]   I see patients in my outpatient clinical work
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.400]   with treatment-resistant depression,
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.480]   so very hard-to-treat severe illness
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.560]   where medications haven't been working.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.600]   I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.520]   These are my two clinical focal areas.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.560]   But then I do emergency room work as well.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.120]   But the depression, why do I focus on that?
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:11.120]   It's so, one feels tantalizingly close
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.820]   to helping these people who are suffering so deeply.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.940]   And that's why I focused on it,
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:20.620]   is these are people who,
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.960]   there may not even be anything situational
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.420]   that's difficult or challenging in their life.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.100]   You can have people who seem to have everything
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:28.940]   that you would want.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.780]   Every objective measure of their life is fine,
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:35.680]   and yet they can be just hit with this
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:41.200]   unstoppable hopelessness,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.340]   an inability to see into the future,
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:47.520]   a discounting of the value of their own action.
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.000]   Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.880]   or they are unable to enjoy things.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.460]   We call this anhedonia.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.220]   There's no reward, no pleasure,
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.200]   not in food, social interaction, movies, books,
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.320]   anything that they would enjoy, positivity gone.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.280]   They can have a profound negative internal state,
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.160]   psychic pain, and these things can seem,
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.940]   and in the severe cases are inescapable.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:19.320]   So what is going on?
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.420]   Why is this state part of human existence?
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.660]   It's got a strong biological genetic link, we know that.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.300]   It's been linked to certain genes,
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:34.520]   certain regions of the chromosome, and twin studies.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.160]   There's a clear genetic link.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.160]   Doesn't explain everything, but it's a big part of it.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.320]   Genetics are a strong contributor.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.920]   And although you can have depression
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.240]   without anything terrible going on in your life,
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.060]   the symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:57.180]   But at a very deep level,
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:00.920]   there's nothing we can measure in a person objectively,
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.440]   so we don't have, there's not a known chemical,
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.040]   not a known structure that's different,
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.960]   not a known brain activity pattern
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.040]   that we can pick up with EEG.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.520]   A lot of people are exploring this,
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.280]   but right now we have no objective measures.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.200]   All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.700]   We explore them,
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:23.700]   distinguish them from other possible causes,
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.320]   and then what do we do?
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.400]   Well, we have a range of treatments.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.460]   We have medications that can help people,
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.300]   do help people, but not everybody.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.320]   And if they don't work,
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.760]   then we can go to brain stimulation methods.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.640]   We can do things even like electroconvulsive therapy,
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.400]   which is very effective,
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.900]   but it's sort of the final thing we go to in the end.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.320]   And so we have treatments.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.160]   They work for some people.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.560]   They don't do everything we'd like.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.680]   But here's the problem is at a very deep level,
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.540]   we don't understand really what's going on in the brain.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.340]   We don't have a physical interpretation of the problem.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.780]   We have all these symptoms,
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:07.740]   but we can't yet point to a set of cells
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.520]   or a set of circuits or an activity pattern
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.220]   that is causing major depression,
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.620]   this disease state per se in human beings.
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:17.860]   - Why do you think you can't yet
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.320]   from an optogenetics perspective?
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.200]   Is it because there's so many possible causes?
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.920]   Is it so many things involved?
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.540]   - So I think the answer is there are many things involved
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.640]   and all these different symptoms that I've mentioned,
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.900]   those we can study and those we can fix,
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.580]   the individual symptoms.
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.200]   And we can do this in animals to be clear.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.060]   So in a mouse, for example,
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:44.060]   we can instantaneously and precisely turn up or down
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:48.080]   the motivation of an animal to overcome a challenge.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.520]   We can turn up or down its ability to be motivated by,
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.520]   or we think experience reward from situations or actions.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:01.560]   We can increase its apparent energy level,
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.200]   its drive to meet challenges.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.120]   We can turn up or down social interaction.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.300]   All these individual features of depression,
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:17.180]   individual symptoms, we now can point to exact projections
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:20.720]   and cells that are causal in meeting these.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.760]   But what we don't know is why all these different symptoms
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.480]   show up together in major depression,
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.040]   in the human disease syndrome.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.600]   And that's the mystery.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.940]   It's sort of in other fields of medicine,
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.440]   someone with congestive heart failure
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.720]   who comes into the clinic,
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.040]   they have very different symptoms.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.080]   They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:46.240]   Couldn't be two more different across the body
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.740]   sets of symptoms.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:49.760]   Neither one obviously related to the heart,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.800]   but they're both happening
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.040]   'cause the heart is not working as a pump.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.180]   And now thankfully in cardiology,
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:58.980]   we understand these disparate symptoms
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.620]   that seem totally unrelated can be completely understood
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.740]   because there's an altered pump action of the heart.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:10.340]   That's what we are hoping for in psychiatry
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:13.620]   and in the study of depression or any disease.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:17.740]   These different symptoms, the inability to enjoy things,
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:18.840]   the hopelessness.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.380]   What's the unifying principle?
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.300]   - Unifying.
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:26.780]   I mean, is there some truth to that, the Tolstoy quote,
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.820]   that all happy families are alike
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:31.740]   and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way?
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.480]   So basically, I mean, this is the human condition.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.260]   And basically, the physicists long to find
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.620]   the theory of everything.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:48.180]   Isn't understanding depression essentially
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:52.940]   require you to really have the big theory of everything
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.920]   for the human mind?
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:57.820]   - I think it would certainly be nice
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.700]   to have a theory of everything.
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:00.740]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:01.580]   I don't think we need--
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.860]   - Understatement of the century.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:04.700]   It would be nice.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.820]   It's also a good question if it's possible.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:08.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:11.940]   Well, that I have some thoughts on too.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:14.900]   But to this specific question,
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.340]   I don't think we need a theory of everything.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:20.380]   I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:23.540]   But even shy of that, we can treat symptoms
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.620]   and that's a big step.
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:27.900]   And as you say, different unhappy families are different.
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.060]   Different unhappy people are different.
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.740]   If we have somebody who comes to the clinic
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:34.700]   and I see someone with a profound anhedonia
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:38.060]   as one of their main symptoms, inability to enjoy things.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.380]   And if I know based on optogenetics work and animal work
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:44.700]   that a particular medication can treat anhedonia,
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.340]   even if it doesn't fix major depression in everybody,
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.420]   if I treat that one symptom in that one person,
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.300]   that's a good thing.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:55.300]   And so we don't need the theory of everything
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:58.420]   and we don't even need the unifying principle
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:01.620]   to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:05.580]   - How much does talking help for diagnosis
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.740]   and for treatment, would you say, for depression?
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:11.540]   - It's a big part of what we do.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:15.260]   Every good psychiatrist should be pretty adept
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:18.200]   in these verbal communications and talk therapy
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.020]   as part of what they do.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.100]   I give medications.
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.900]   I deliver brain stimulation treatments,
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:26.340]   but a big, big part of everything I do with every patient
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:31.000]   is talk therapy because it works so well together
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.300]   with these other modalities.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:36.180]   Even alone, it can help people with moderate
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.020]   or mild depression by itself.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.620]   People with severe depression,
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:46.300]   people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.820]   you don't wanna do talk therapy alone.
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:48.880]   That's not gonna do it,
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.240]   but it still is crucial to do together with the others.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.240]   And it's critical because it's part of how you reshape
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.360]   cognitions, complex activity patterns,
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.600]   and you won't get to that with a medication
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.420]   or a brain stimulation treatment.
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:07.820]   - Do you have advice for people who suffer
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:12.700]   from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:16.560]   both for those people, and do you have advice for people
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.840]   who love the people who suffer from depression
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.120]   and want to help?
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.680]   - Yeah.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.180]   One of the incredibly frustrating things about depression
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.160]   is the very nature of it makes it hard for the people
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.800]   who suffer to get treatment because they're hopeless,
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:37.520]   so they don't think treatment will help.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.600]   They have low energy, so they're not motivated
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.700]   to participate in treatment in many cases.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.520]   Sometimes they're actively suicidal.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.320]   That certainly doesn't help.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:53.320]   They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.520]   from being effective, so the loved ones,
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.360]   that's where the loved ones are so important
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:00.360]   is helping them overcome these barriers to treatment,
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.080]   the motivation, the safety, and the insight.
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.520]   That's critical, and particularly for the severe cases.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.840]   For the mild cases where people still have some insight
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.640]   and motivation and energy to get something done,
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.240]   there are many things you can do.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:25.540]   Exercise is extremely important in mood, maintenance,
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.480]   regulation of sleep, and getting sufficient
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.200]   and regular enough sleep is very important.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.040]   And talk therapy can be helpful
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.640]   in those mild or moderate cases,
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.720]   just looking at cognitions, looking at patterns of thought
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.560]   that people may have fallen into, where they catastrophize,
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.700]   where they spiral from small things into big things.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:52.680]   A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions,
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.120]   can help people identify those patterns
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.280]   they may have in themselves
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:01.000]   that are taking occasional negative thoughts,
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.840]   which everybody has, and magnifying those
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.680]   into more persistent negative states.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.800]   Once you, if you work at this, and it's kind of like homework,
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.260]   this is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.320]   it's very structured, very organized, you work hard,
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.120]   it requires insight and motivation,
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.360]   and you have to be motivated.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.420]   But if you are, then you can identify these triggers
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.320]   that send you down particular pathways
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.100]   and work to intercept them.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:30.480]   And that is amazingly very effective
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.340]   in mild to moderate cases.
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:35.440]   - So you basically have to train yourself
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.280]   to see the world as a collection of triggers,
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.880]   and you have to first understand, collect the data,
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.200]   like basically see every experience
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:53.760]   as a thing that creates a follow-on emotion, a feeling.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:47:00.520]   I've learned this on social media,
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.360]   where early on, like all of us,
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.880]   I'll say something, I'll kind of respond to negativity
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.880]   with negativity, and then you observe the result of that.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.480]   - That's more like it.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.280]   - Over time, you think, wait a minute,
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.260]   this thing that I've been doing,
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:25.680]   where when somebody says, "You suck,"
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.560]   and you say, "No, you suck,"
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:32.960]   that never produces the result you thought it might.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.380]   - Yeah, so might not want to just,
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:38.440]   don't say you suck back.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.640]   And I do this through a lot of things in life.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.480]   I'm very fortunate to not suffer from depression,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.360]   but I, first of all, I have had
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.100]   and have people in my life who do.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:57.080]   And also, all of us have depression,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.960]   who don't suffer from depression, have depression out.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.120]   It's always knocking on the door.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:03.960]   - Right, yeah.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.880]   - And so you have mild,
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.320]   I mean, if you're very careless
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.280]   with the triggers all around you,
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:17.960]   then you're just, I think all of us have the capacity
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.280]   to really suffer from that kind of chemical
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.220]   or psychological or philosophical existential crisis.
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.080]   - But then it raises the question,
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.400]   why are we built this way?
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.720]   It seems like it doesn't make sense, right?
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.440]   And here's where some of this thinking
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.760]   about where we came from
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.520]   as the human family is kind of interesting.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:44.400]   It doesn't make sense that somewhere on that spectrum
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.200]   that it's good to detect that there's an array
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.900]   of adverse forces out there in the world right now
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:55.400]   at this moment, and to withdraw,
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.320]   to hunker down, to not fight, not strive,
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.480]   not try to meet the challenge,
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.560]   and outweigh these negative forces
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.240]   that are present out there.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:09.760]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.960]   And all animals that have been studied
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960]   in one form or another show this.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.240]   Even the worm that I mentioned earlier,
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.920]   C. elegans with 302 neurons,
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.020]   it can effectively give up in challenging situations.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.880]   We've done this with zebrafish,
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.420]   tiny little transparent fish.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:30.360]   You can give them a challenging situation
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.280]   and they will give up.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.920]   But then if you stimulate a couple
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:37.180]   of very specific brain regions in particular ways,
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:40.460]   you can motivate them to overcome the challenge.
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:41.800]   And if you inhibit those regions,
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.680]   they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.220]   You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:49.880]   So this is an ancestral conserved pattern
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.060]   to detect that things are pretty bad out there.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.660]   And to conserve energy, to hunker down,
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.260]   to wait out the storm.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:03.060]   - So as use, unfortunately,
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.140]   many of our maladies have useful roots
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:10.240]   in our, that contribute to our survival.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.900]   So both depression and motivation have uses.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:18.540]   And sometimes it's nice to just shut the hell up
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.420]   and huddle with the penguins.
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:21.260]   - Right.
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.700]   - Versus for some unknown reason,
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.880]   venture out on your own into the mountains,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.060]   like a David Goggins type character.
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.660]   So what's the difference to you between,
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.140]   you see patients, between sort of rigorous
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:39.820]   psychoanalysis, I don't know if you consider
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.900]   where you, like talk therapy and psychoanalysis,
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.740]   are they neighbors, are they overlapping?
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.220]   - They're neighbors.
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.100]   Psychoanalysis is, it's a, they're relatively,
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.920]   it's not nearly done as much as the talk therapy,
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.420]   like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:51:00.540]   The psychoanalysis is a little more niche now,
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:03.140]   and partly because it's not,
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.900]   data isn't, in terms of actual treatment,
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.100]   of actual therapeutic effects,
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:13.060]   data not as supportive as for cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:16.020]   But it's still interesting as, for insight,
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.560]   people, a lot of people still do it
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.740]   to gain insight into themselves.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:23.200]   And in general, it's a good sort of conversation starter,
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.500]   those methods, they're good for getting things out.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:30.320]   We don't focus on dreams, typically these days
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.560]   in psychiatry, but they're great conversation starters,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.560]   they're great ways to get things out if people have,
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.040]   and so we like to use those methods
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.080]   just to get the ball rolling sometimes,
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.940]   get people to open up a little bit.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.000]   But the actual treatment tends not to involve
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.080]   these psychoanalytic approaches,
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.580]   where you are really probing the unconscious mind
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.480]   and its manifestation through dreams, for example,
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:59.220]   as the goal, that's not the goal.
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.560]   Modern talk therapy, we're really focusing on treatment,
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.040]   how to get people to feel better.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.120]   - See, I use that as a conversation opener,
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:09.840]   the Freudian thing, where I try to delve at a bar
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.220]   of the deep sexual desires in a person's subconscious,
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:16.040]   and I find that opens up possibilities very quickly.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:20.360]   - No, I mean, this is a silly sounding question,
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:22.200]   but what's the difference between
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.040]   cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:30.320]   So, 'cause I personally, as a fan of conversations,
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.840]   as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts,
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:36.040]   versus like audiobook, I like both,
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.600]   but they're very different, and I like conversation.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.240]   I like, it makes me personally very anxious,
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.040]   so I like to be the listener, like a third wheel,
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.680]   like overhearing a conversation kind of thing,
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:51.200]   but it's a really powerful method for humans
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.360]   to explore each other's mind, just raw conversation.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.280]   So, do you think it can be more productive
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.040]   to be very systematic about it,
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.720]   or is conversation itself the art form of helping each other,
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.760]   understanding each other and helping each other?
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.640]   - There are forms of talk therapy
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.960]   that are essentially conversational,
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.600]   or they much more approach pure conversation.
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:17.120]   There's a befriending therapy,
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.520]   there's interpersonal therapy.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:23.080]   These are approaches that are purely talk therapy,
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:26.800]   but they're not as structured as cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.200]   Cognitive behavioral therapy, there are manuals,
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.120]   there are guidelines, you can almost go through it
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.680]   in a very cookbook-y way,
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.720]   there's homework that you get done.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.380]   So, in its fullest form, it's very different
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.160]   from these more conversational strategies.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:44.280]   But what's interesting is sometimes people compare them,
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.800]   and so you'll see almost like randomized controlled studies
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:51.320]   comparing cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.520]   with interpersonal therapy, for example.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:56.120]   And they both can work, and actually in some studies
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.960]   they look comparable.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:03.280]   So, to your point, conversation and insights
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.460]   that come from conversation, if done well,
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:09.040]   if done artfully, can be as powerful.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.880]   - This reminds me of Robin Williams,
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.940]   so I have to ask you several questions here on that.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.960]   But one of my favorite movies is "Good Will Hunting."
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.360]   I don't know if you've seen it with Robin Williams.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.900]   So, as a psychiatrist yourself,
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.600]   can you do a deep analysis of this other famous psychiatrist,
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.720]   which is the movie character,
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.680]   played by Robin Williams in "Good Will Hunting"?
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:33.240]   Is it just the caricature between a psychiatrist
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.240]   and patient relationship, or is there something to you
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:41.200]   that was moving about his ability to connect
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.260]   to this obviously struggling young kid?
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:46.540]   - I think you've hit on the key thing there,
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:48.960]   which is the depth of the connection.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.960]   If there's a too powerful connection,
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:58.340]   that can impair therapy,
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.120]   because it could impair open communication.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.540]   If someone, if a patient sees the role,
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:08.140]   sees the relationship in a particular way,
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:09.700]   like in a friendly way, maybe,
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:14.400]   or like a parental child type way,
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.480]   that can cause problems,
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.620]   because then what they choose to share,
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:20.400]   what they choose to bring up,
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.880]   is selected to be appropriate
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.640]   for that view of the relationship.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.520]   And so, I and many other talk therapists
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.620]   actually prefer not to let things get,
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:37.520]   not let the connection get that deep.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.200]   You wanna have trust,
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.580]   you wanna have a therapeutic alliance,
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:42.640]   we sometimes call it,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:47.200]   but it's got to be enough of a blank slate
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.160]   that the patient is not consciously or unconsciously
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.540]   constrained in what they choose to share.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:56:00.800]   And so, great movie, great actors, all good,
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.360]   no complaints, except realistically,
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.480]   the relationship should be a little more
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.640]   arm's length than that.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.160]   - Let's pretend this is real life.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.920]   Sometimes, can't you leave a little bit of yourself
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.520]   in the interaction with the patient?
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:19.360]   - Yeah. - I mean,
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.040]   it's another human being. - Yes.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.400]   So, it's a balance, and actually you do need some of it,
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.840]   because let's say this person is having challenges,
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.800]   interpersonal challenges in their life.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.080]   The best way to notice what those are
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.880]   and to identify them and to work with them
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.200]   is if you can elicit some of those problems
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.600]   in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.960]   And this is really powerful.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.400]   As long as you're alert to it, aware of it,
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.960]   and you don't let it go out of hand,
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.960]   this transference, we call it,
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.960]   is when you transfer in between the current
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.560]   therapeutic relationship and external relationships
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.660]   that the patient may have had with others.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:16.600]   And so, if the therapist starts to feel an inner feeling,
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.080]   like anger, let's say, so let's say you have a patient
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.400]   who is stirring frustration in you,
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.480]   or even in extreme cases, anger,
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.960]   the best thing for the therapist to do in that case
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.160]   is to recognize it and to realize
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.360]   that's probably being stirred by other people
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.800]   in the patient's life, and that could be the source
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.160]   of a lot of problems.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.000]   And so, instead of trying to wall it off
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.800]   and say, "Oh, I shouldn't be feeling that,
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.840]   "I better be a better therapist,"
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.640]   instead, recognize it and use it
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.980]   and help the patient that way.
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.360]   And so, you've gotta be a human being,
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.840]   you've gotta be a person who feels,
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.440]   you've gotta be open.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:57.280]   - But be in control of it and be aware of it.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.640]   If I may, I just wanna read, 'cause it's one
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:00.760]   of my favorite scenes.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.320]   Probably one of the greatest scenes,
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.260]   one of the greatest scenes in movie history
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:08.180]   because Robin Williams does a single take.
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:10.120]   - Is that right?
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.040]   - So, this is a very interesting interaction between them.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:15.380]   So, Will, and I'm sure this is a common interaction,
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:19.080]   maybe with a therapist and a patient,
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.280]   maybe with a father and son,
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.480]   where Will, the young character,
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.040]   the young, brilliant mathematician,
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.360]   and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist,
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:31.840]   where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.940]   and then does a deep, critical analysis of the painting
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.780]   that basically describes,
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:41.880]   pretending as if he can understand
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.400]   another human being completely
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.440]   by just looking at their painting.
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:48.100]   And then Sean gives this whole speech
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:52.320]   that contrasts sort of raw intelligence
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.280]   and the wisdom of experience.
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:56.880]   And Sean says, "Single take."
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:59.640]   He says, "You've never been out of Boston, right?"
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:01.280]   And Will says, "Nope."
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.680]   All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:07.360]   And then Sean gives this speech.
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.800]   "If I asked you about art,
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:10.300]   "you'd probably give me this skinny
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:12.900]   "and about every art book ever written.
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:15.660]   "Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.500]   "Life's work, political aspirations,
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:19.660]   "him and the Pope, sexual orientation,
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.340]   "the whole works, right?
[01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:23.940]   "But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:26.000]   "in the Sistine Chapel.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.600]   "You never actually stood there

[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.720]   "If I asked you about women,

[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.320]   "Probably not, but let's say.
[01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:59.800]   "Once more into the breach, dear friends.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.160]   "But you've never been near one.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.000]   "You've never held your best friend's head on your lap
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.020]   "and watched him gasp his last breath,

[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.660]   "But you presume to know everything about me
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.680]   "because you saw a painting of mine.

[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.220]   "Do you think I know the first thing
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:27.540]   "about how hard your life has been,
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:31.660]   "how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist?
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.900]   "Does that encapsulate you?
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:35.920]   "Personally, I don't give a shit about all that
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.460]   "because you know what?
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:39.140]   "I can't learn anything from you
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:41.660]   "that I can't read in some fucking book,
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:45.160]   "unless you want to talk about you, who you are.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.460]   "And I'm fascinated, I'm in.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:50.300]   "But you don't want to do that, do you, sport?
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:53.600]   "You're terrified of what you might say.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.820]   "Your move, chief."
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:57.520]   Well done, sir, I know it's a movie.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:58.820]   It's interesting, right?
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:00.140]   So some of that conversation
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:03.140]   is at some intellectual level, too.
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.420]   It's not just emotional, it's something,
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:10.700]   the reason I kinda connect with that is,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:14.300]   that's a lot of work for a therapist.
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.020]   Like, to really understand another, 'cause he's,
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:19.500]   I mean, from, okay, I know this is fictional,
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.860]   but just, there's calculation happening.
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.020]   He deeply cares to say the words
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:27.960]   that the other person needs to hear,
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.620]   but also a little bit loses himself in the pride,
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:35.220]   but then catches himself again,
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.620]   switches from anger to connection.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:40.900]   - Yeah, a lot is brought up there.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.900]   You're right, there has to be some emotion
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:46.140]   in the therapist to care enough to keep going,
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:51.140]   to keep probing, to open up as he's doing so, right?
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.900]   He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities,
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:56.740]   but that gave him authenticity.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.940]   He had to open himself up so that the kid
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:03.740]   would see the authenticity and open himself up in return.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:10.020]   So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:10.860]   You have to be careful.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.720]   You don't wanna do too much,
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.520]   but opening up a little bit does help.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:20.080]   It does create a chance.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.380]   You're offering up something,
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.700]   and that helps the patient come back in return,
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:28.700]   and it gives you that believability and authenticity.
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:31.340]   - Do you pay the price for that, for opening up?
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.860]   - You can.
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:36.500]   - You have a family, you have an incredibly
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:38.180]   difficult research.
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:40.340]   You're doing a lot of things in your world.
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:42.640]   I mean, it's a price you pay for like,
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:45.740]   - Well, this is one of the terrifying things
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.560]   about writing the book was,
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:52.580]   I do open up in a little bit about my own personal life,
[02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:53.800]   my own personal challenges,
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:55.500]   and that was a considered decision
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:04:00.500]   because I could have done the patient work
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.840]   and the science work and the history
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.460]   of the human family work and tied it all together,
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:12.820]   but it wasn't, in an early draft, it was like that,
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.640]   but it wasn't real yet.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.480]   It wasn't something that everybody could connect with,
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.280]   and I said, then I realized, look, if I'm gonna do this,
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:26.320]   I've gotta open up myself,
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.320]   and then people can connect with me
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.720]   and see what I'm really saying, and so I did,
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:34.200]   and that was, it was not something
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:37.440]   that I'd gone in planning to do.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.320]   In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.260]   It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did,
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:43.760]   but it was scary.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:47.880]   - Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:55.500]   - You know, I had, things haven't always been easy,
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.300]   personally or professionally.
[02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:00.820]   I had moments, you know, I was effectively a single dad
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:03.180]   for a while, a number of years,
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:07.220]   and these came at probably the hardest, also, professional.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:09.440]   A lifetime's for me, too.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.400]   The absolute hardest, days of late medical school,
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:16.320]   internship, you know, taking call,
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:19.140]   you know, getting up at 3 a.m., you know, surgery,
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:24.360]   medicine, rounds, unforgiving environments,
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.740]   and then all the while, you know, personal life,
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:29.980]   you know, stripped down to the bare,
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:32.520]   and these were low moments,
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.440]   and then I was hit particularly hard by
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:39.400]   just experiences on the clinical ward,
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:42.020]   connecting too deeply with patients,
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:44.040]   like a child with a brain tumor,
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.660]   and feeling it too strongly,
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.440]   and those things,
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:51.760]   when you get down to those lowest of the low moments,
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.560]   when everything is stripped away,
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.160]   and there's only this raw core,
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:00.240]   well, yeah, that's pretty hard.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.080]   That was probably the lowest moment,
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.200]   and you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:05.760]   you know, what's left,
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:10.040]   and then what are the roots out from there,
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:15.040]   and that can be powerful to see in yourself.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:18.840]   - Have you thought about killing yourself?
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:20.280]   - I have not.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.120]   I have not.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.580]   - Have you seen that thought in the distance?
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:28.960]   - I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind,
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:32.000]   and I have not seen it even in the distance,
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.900]   and in some ways, I've wondered if that's made me,
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:40.720]   am I a less effective psychiatrist because of that?
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.080]   I've felt everything stripped away.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.440]   I've been at the lowest of the low,
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.200]   and yet that--
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.040]   - There's still hope.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.280]   There's a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.400]   - Right, right.
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.320]   - So you never lost, even for brief moments, that--
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:57.600]   - Never did.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.040]   I don't know why.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:06:59.880]   - You don't know why.
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:00.840]   - There was no reason.
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.680]   - You don't know why.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.960]   - There was no reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.720]   - So it was just a light without reason.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.860]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:13.180]   - What wisdom do you draw from that time?
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:19.480]   So first of all, you said something funny,
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:22.040]   which is I wonder if it,
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:26.480]   that it's somehow not having thoughts of suicide
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.440]   limits your capacity to truly understand
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:34.760]   somebody who is having those thoughts.
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:39.360]   So how many demons must a psychiatrist have
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.460]   in order to be a good psychiatrist?
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:45.440]   - You know, this is a really interesting question.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.580]   I think everybody knows, and I can say this,
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:50.660]   that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.
[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:53.680]   We think about ourselves, right?
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.760]   We think about our brains.
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.920]   That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.320]   is we think, oh, that's interesting going on in there.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.600]   What's that about?
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.880]   So a little introspective, a little introverted maybe,
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:07.080]   and that's what can make us good when we're good.
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:12.680]   But also that may select for people
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:14.700]   who have some unusual aspects,
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:17.100]   but you don't have to have all of them.
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:21.080]   There's a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.320]   I think having some of those,
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.080]   some of it but not all of it is enough.
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.600]   You get to see how low things can get.
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:30.880]   You can get a,
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:35.680]   you get empathy from that,
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:38.440]   even if the symptoms are not the same.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.080]   - Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:42.840]   - That's right, that's right.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:46.840]   - Do you yourself have to practice observing triggers
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:49.500]   just as a human operating in this world?
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:53.200]   - I've definitely, those skills that have come from therapy,
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:55.960]   I've found them useful.
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.060]   If I notice that,
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:09:00.520]   we've all been through experiences where we wonder,
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.400]   oh, I got really mad in that interaction.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.320]   Why did I get that mad?
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.960]   Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated,
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.160]   but man, why did I?
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.160]   And then thinking about it and realizing,
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.540]   okay, back up here, think about the broader context.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:23.160]   Think about how that relates to prior events in my life.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:25.920]   Okay, yeah, so this is a thing for me
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.160]   when something of this class happens, then it triggers me.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.420]   So going forward, I'm gonna be aware of that.
[02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:36.260]   And I've definitely used that 'cause it's,
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:40.400]   you don't wanna be out of control of those emotions.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:41.440]   You wanna identify them,
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.880]   you wanna know where they come from,
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.760]   and you wanna head them off
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:48.280]   as a civilized human being living on this earth,
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.060]   trying to get along with other people.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:52.000]   You wanna understand those moments.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.880]   - Let me return to Robin Williams for a second,
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.800]   and looking at Robin Williams, the actor,
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.640]   sorry, the human.
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:06.320]   And 'cause you mentioned for depression,
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.240]   you can have everything going well.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.920]   And I think there's just famous cases of just public figures
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:15.120]   'cause a lot of people know them,
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:19.720]   where they suffer quietly,
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.640]   and it seems like from the outside perspective
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.840]   that they have everything going for them,
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.920]   that they're at the top of their career.
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.600]   You know, two people that come to mind
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.320]   are Robin Williams and Anthony Bourdain.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.560]   What insight do you have in why either of those taken,
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.880]   why Robin Williams, a comedian,
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:42.360]   one of sort of the most jolly humans.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.840]   Obviously, there was always the darkness
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.840]   that he was channeling in order to present the happiness.
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:53.160]   But it feels like that realness is only possible
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:56.320]   when you're deeply self-honest and analytical.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.440]   And then if you're deeply self-honest,
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:00.280]   you're going to realize
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.200]   that there's a lot of beautiful things about life
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.600]   that you can discover.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.240]   And if you do that,
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:07.800]   how can you possibly then take your own life?
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:10.200]   And you go through all of these thoughts.
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:15.200]   And I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams,
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.000]   which is why it was really difficult to see.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.040]   How can even him,
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:22.200]   how can even Robin Williams take his own life?
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:24.600]   So I don't know if there's something to be said
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:25.920]   about the nature of depression
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.760]   from just looking at his case.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:33.080]   - I think the action of suicide is not well understood.
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:36.200]   It doesn't always, although often is,
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.640]   correlated with depression.
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.280]   There are cases of suicide
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.320]   where there is not clear depression.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:42.880]   That's in the minority.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.240]   - By the way, if I just,
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.080]   'cause you said it's so interesting,
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:47.680]   action of suicide.
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.800]   'Cause there's also thoughts of suicide.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.320]   And probably those,
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.560]   they're probably somewhat understood,
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:55.840]   but it's an interesting,
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.280]   'cause you can think of suicide,
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.880]   if you have suicidal ideation,
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:04.000]   you can think of that for so many reasons.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:04.840]   - That's right.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:07.280]   - And the,
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.520]   I mean,
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:14.640]   thoughts sometimes,
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.360]   like painful thoughts,
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:19.240]   angry thoughts, or thoughts in general,
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.240]   can be very different.
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.320]   Like fantasies, for example.
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:24.440]   You can fantasize, like sexual fantasies.
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.120]   You can fantasize,
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:28.480]   I was just for humor's sake,
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:29.400]   wanted to mention stuff,
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.800]   but then people will think I'm serious.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.360]   So I'm not gonna mention anything.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.120]   But sexual fantasies,
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:34.960]   and then there's,
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:36.400]   I know there's people that have sexual fantasies
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:38.560]   and they don't wanna actually do that in real life.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:41.400]   That that sexual fantasy serves some kind of purpose
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.160]   in imagination only.
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:44.320]   And in that same way,
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.920]   suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.800]   is very unlikely to lead to action.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.160]   And yet there's other thoughts
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.520]   that maybe are more amorphous
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.160]   that do lead to action.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.320]   And that leap,
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:57.720]   yeah, that, oh boy,
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:58.560]   that's a fascinating,
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.120]   and that's such a philosophically powerful thought
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.680]   to not exist.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.680]   Like that question,
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:07.880]   that's this, is it Sartre or Camus,
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.000]   Camus, or the mythicist, Camus,
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.600]   who says like basic question of why live?
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.520]   Good question.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.080]   - Yeah, right.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.840]   So that's a great question actually.
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:22.840]   And there are other related questions.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.320]   Some people may have the thought of suicide
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:31.760]   because there seems no point,
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.160]   there's no joy in life.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:36.760]   That's one reason that some people can put forward.
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:37.600]   Sometimes there's an,
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:39.880]   it's not just the absence of joy,
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:41.480]   there's an active pain,
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:44.000]   an active psychic pain in some people.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.560]   And that, the inescapability of that
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:50.520]   is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.400]   And then there are interpersonal
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.680]   and cultural reasons as well that can show up.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:57.320]   But the act,
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.080]   this act of ending of the self is,
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.120]   in all these cases,
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.440]   there's no real way to study this in animals.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:06.280]   No other animal as far as we know that we can study
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:10.760]   has this concept of this is myself.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:13.160]   The situation is not tolerable,
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:15.400]   therefore I will end the self.
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.240]   To our knowledge,
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:18.760]   this is not something that can be studied in other animals.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:20.720]   So it remains this
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:26.240]   very poorly understood action.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:28.600]   And in predicting it,
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:29.840]   so what do we do as psychiatrists?
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:30.680]   We have this challenge.
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:32.680]   People come to the emergency room,
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.960]   they say they're suicidal,
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.360]   or their friends say they're suicidal,
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:39.000]   or they've taken some action that didn't lead to death.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.040]   What do we do?
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:44.000]   Well, there's a whole range of options.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.640]   Was it a suicidal gesture
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:48.280]   in the sense of not intending death?
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.800]   Or was it,
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:51.920]   was the intent death?
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.560]   And if it was the intent was death,
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.400]   what were the reasons?
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.440]   Are the reasons transient?
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.920]   Are they gone now?
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:00.160]   What's the probability that it'll be repeated?
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.560]   So we do all these things
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:04.280]   just to decide what sort of treatment should be carried out.
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:09.040]   But nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology,
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:12.480]   of the cells and circuits and activity patterns
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.840]   that underlie the action to end the self.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:17.880]   It's a very,
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.440]   it's this frustrating thing.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.680]   It's so timely,
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:24.960]   it's so common,
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:26.440]   it shows up in veterans,
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:27.760]   it shows up in kids,
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:30.700]   it shows up in people at every stage of life.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.080]   And yet we're very bad at understanding it
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.040]   and we're relatively poor at predicting it
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.760]   and our tools are not very powerful.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.720]   We can put people in a locked unit,
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.880]   we can give them care therapy for a while.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.280]   At some point,
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.680]   we release them and there's only so much we can do.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:50.840]   It's one of the most frustrating things,
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:53.600]   the suffering that is linked to suicidality.
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:56.680]   - But it is a decision and it is an action.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:58.400]   And if you look at optogenetics,
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.800]   you should be able to one day
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:05.480]   sort of understand the dynamics of such weighty decisions.
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:06.520]   - Individual causes then,
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:07.600]   if someone is anhedonic,
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.360]   if there is no joy in life,
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.760]   that very likely is addressable by optogenetics.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:16.880]   We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:20.680]   The motivation to overcome challenges,
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:25.680]   that we have some hope of understanding.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:28.400]   Psychic pain, internal negative states,
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.360]   we have actually a handle on that as well.
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:33.000]   There's a structure in the brain called the habenula
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.440]   and some linked structures around it
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:38.760]   that seems to generate this negative internal state.
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:42.520]   It's active when a state of acute disappointment,
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:47.280]   acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.240]   Moments of unexpected pain.
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:54.240]   The habenula is there, it seems,
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.080]   it's active to report on internal negativity
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.920]   with its action.
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:02.680]   And so you could imagine strategies
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:03.880]   to target this brain structure
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.240]   that might have the effect of reducing psychic pain,
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:09.760]   reducing the negativity of internal states.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.960]   That is a very concrete hope.
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:14.160]   It's precise, it's anatomical.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.400]   Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.760]   to go after that question.
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.440]   So I think there is hope.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.960]   If you look at the individual causes,
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:25.960]   the individual symptoms relating to suicide,
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:26.960]   and then it's like a puzzle,
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.000]   you put together the puzzle pieces.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.280]   - By the way, I do think my habenula
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:37.440]   is functioning very actively.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.280]   (Dave laughing)
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.920]   And I wonder if it's like,
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.120]   'cause you can also learn to channel these things, right?
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:45.920]   Some of the things we suffer from,
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.160]   I mean, there's degrees of suffering,
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:53.160]   can be a source of progress and personal growth
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:57.000]   and development and all those kinds of things.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000]   I mean, what is it, Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:09.160]   I wonder if he's written some of those things,
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.600]   if his stomach was all great.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:18.880]   I kind of think that a difficult life in some form,
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:21.760]   you get to choose in some regard,
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:22.800]   in some you don't.
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.360]   The difficulties you have and the ones you do have,
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.240]   it's nice to use if possible.
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:28.760]   It's sometimes it's nice to treat,
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:31.460]   sometimes it's nice to use.
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:33.560]   - Well, the way you phrase it, I think you're using it.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.560]   I could be wrong, but if you phrase it
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:39.180]   in this semi-humorous way about your habenula,
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:43.780]   it seems to me that you're using that to good effect.
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:46.280]   Now, but one never really knows
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:48.120]   what someone else's internal state is.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.280]   As I look at you, I don't know the depths
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:51.840]   of what's going on.
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.840]   And it's possible that it's a much harder situation in there.
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.400]   - Yes, so I actually worry about this a lot.
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:02.120]   So I'm extremely self-critical.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:04.400]   Like in the privacy of my own mind,
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.820]   which is an interesting thing when you get
[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:09.940]   to meet the internet and the internet will tell you you suck.
[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:15.080]   But for now, now this is what I worry about
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:16.840]   and I'm very paying attention.
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:20.760]   For now, it's really, I just have this very negative voice.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:25.080]   But that voice seems to be very useful for productivity.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.320]   And so I channel it.
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.880]   I just put it on the table and let that voice talk to me.
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.960]   But I'm very, I'm like monitoring that voice
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.600]   'cause looking at Robin Williams,
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.160]   you know, you get older, your brain changes,
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:41.240]   or like you're, and then that voice can now
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.560]   all of a sudden grow, right?
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.240]   And then where you can't control it as much,
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.880]   you have to be very careful with these kinds of things.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:50.160]   - You're very right about that.
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.080]   So my negativity, I have this,
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:54.440]   I never think I've done enough
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:57.440]   is sort of where my negativity comes from inside.
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:02.440]   I never think that I've met the potential of the moment.
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:07.400]   I haven't done, I haven't, you know,
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:12.200]   made the most of the opportunities that are available.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:15.080]   Still early, I haven't, you know,
[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:16.680]   progressed as far as I should.
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:20.960]   And exactly as you're saying, that works for a while.
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.640]   But then what happens as you get later in life
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:28.640]   and there's less runway to, you know, fix that.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:33.040]   And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.920]   - But also at that point, the negative voice
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:36.680]   starts having more and more of a point.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.880]   It's when you're being very successful,
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:42.180]   it's easy to be like, no, okay, well.
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:45.720]   Like, but later in life, you're really,
[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:49.000]   literally just sitting there on a rocking chair
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.480]   doing nothing and then it's,
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:53.640]   or maybe any kind of tragedy happens.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.160]   Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.480]   loss or you get screwed over in some kind of way.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:02.560]   I don't know.
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:04.200]   And then all of a sudden, the negative voice
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.680]   is just you and the negative voice
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.960]   for days and days and days.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:09.480]   - And so I don't know,
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.160]   to go back to your example of Robin Williams,
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:13.400]   I don't know what was going on inside him.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.440]   I don't know the nature of his internal state.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.080]   Was it active psychic pain that--
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:20.240]   - May I mention, may I interrupt to just say
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.560]   that Sergei posted an examination of Robin Williams.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:26.600]   His brain tissue suggested that he suffered from,
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:31.600]   quote, diffuse LEWY, Lewy body dementia, LBD.
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:36.560]   Depression is a symptom of LBD
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:40.480]   and it's not about psychology, it's rooted in urology.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.000]   This is words from Sergei.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.640]   His brain was falling apart.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:44.480]   - Yeah.
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.360]   - Lewy body dementia,
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.680]   this is a very interesting neurological disorder
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:51.880]   where among other things, there's neuron death indeed.
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.560]   So you've got frank neuron loss.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:58.280]   It's not just a matter of some longstanding psychic pain,
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:00.920]   but you've got a progressive loss.
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:03.000]   And so clearly you've got a situation
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.480]   where he could have finally reached a point
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.520]   where the balance that he'd worked out
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:12.440]   between negativity and positivity was disrupted due to loss.
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.480]   The wrong cells died.
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:16.920]   The wrong projections were cut by the Lewy body dementia.
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:19.600]   Certainly dopamine neurons die in Lewy body dementia.
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:23.440]   Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:25.760]   of reward and pleasure that we experience,
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:27.360]   among other roles.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.200]   So clearly in his case,
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:32.720]   there could have been a very concrete
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.280]   cellular neurological issue that was progressive
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:36.860]   and pushed him to that point.
[02:22:36.860 --> 02:22:41.720]   - But were you about to make a point about broader
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.040]   that if there is a neurological degeneration?
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:47.340]   - Yeah, so in his case, not knowing that,
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:49.680]   it could have been simply that,
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:52.760]   let's say he had an internal psychic pain state
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.680]   and he was in sort of a compensated mode
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:57.520]   for much of his life,
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.800]   able to generate enough joy from his comedy
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:01.200]   and his social interactions.
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:04.160]   And then, but eventually later in life,
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:08.160]   those things drop away, the balance shifts.
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:10.760]   You get tired of fighting the pain for that long.
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.280]   And then, so you've got this time dependent
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:14.760]   non-stationarity that happens.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:18.280]   And then the same symptom
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.240]   becomes no longer tolerable in the end.
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:22.680]   - What is autism?
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:24.320]   What do we know about autism?
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:30.440]   - Human beings exist on a spectrum of how social we can be.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:34.640]   And this is pretty interesting actually, scientifically,
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:38.240]   but also very important clinically.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:39.640]   There are hyper-social states
[02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:42.800]   where people are almost too social.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.760]   There are chromosomal deletion states
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:47.760]   where people have instant affinity and bonding
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:52.760]   and rich, deep seeming connections with people, very verbal.
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:57.600]   On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:02.600]   are not able to keep up with social interactions.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:06.560]   And it's a spectrum.
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:09.480]   Some have mild to moderate difficulties.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:13.800]   They may have an inability to understand
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:16.120]   what the next thing to do in a social situation is,
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:18.960]   but may have perfectly good language abilities.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.880]   And as you progress further along the spectrum,
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:23.200]   that gets more and more severe.
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.200]   So they can't make eye contact
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.080]   because it's too overwhelming
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:29.760]   to think about what has to be done next
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.280]   if a person looks in a particular way.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.460]   And then as you go farther,
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:38.000]   then language and social communication themselves break down
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.980]   so there's no reciprocity, there's no shared enjoyment.
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:43.480]   And this gets very hard then
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.340]   as you get to this far end of the spectrum
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:50.080]   where there's really an absence of social cognition at all
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.840]   and social bonding.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:54.560]   So why does this exist?
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:55.620]   What is it?
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:56.840]   It's very genetic.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.040]   As I mentioned, it's one of the top three or four
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:03.000]   most biological in the sense of most genetically
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.400]   determined of the psychiatric illnesses.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.000]   It does have these interesting positive correlations,
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.240]   slight positive correlations
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:11.420]   with intelligence and education.
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:17.240]   And the reason for that is kind of interesting
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:18.300]   to think about.
[02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.480]   Is there something good about it?
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.040]   Just like, or at least, with at least part of the spectrum,
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:23.980]   is there something good about it?
[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:26.200]   Just as we were talking about for depression,
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:27.480]   as you could say for mania,
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:29.220]   as you could say for schizophrenia.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.680]   And here it's kind of interesting to think about
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:38.320]   the underlying science of what it means
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:40.200]   to be good at a social interaction.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.040]   Someone who's very good at a social interaction
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:48.400]   is incredibly good at dealing with unpredictable information
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.420]   is able to handle this torrent of information
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:56.420]   coming through rapidly changing model of the other person
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.720]   and of the interaction and their model of you,
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:02.520]   your model of them.
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:03.920]   With each word that changes,
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:05.560]   with each new bit of information
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.940]   that comes in through the conversation,
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:09.720]   each bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.400]   And some people are able to keep up
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.640]   with that fire hose of information perfectly well.
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:17.300]   But that's a special brain state to be in.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:20.400]   That's working with unpredictability.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.480]   That's, the only way that can be done
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.080]   is most likely by constantly running models
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.200]   of what the other person might be about to say.
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:34.360]   So you can't stop and think, oh, what did that word mean?
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.280]   What did that shift in eye contact mean?
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:38.800]   You know, what do they mean together?
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.200]   There has to be some advanced work going on
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.440]   where you're predicting what's going on
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:43.840]   if you're to keep up with a rich
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.280]   and fast social interaction.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:49.960]   Now, on the flip side,
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.600]   there are brain states that maybe don't have to work so fast
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.920]   that are extremely important still.
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:57.040]   Dealing with something that's not moving
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:00.200]   or that's predictable, still complex,
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:03.400]   like mathematical proof
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:07.920]   or a very complex arrangement of geometrical shapes,
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:11.080]   a large number of individual non-moving things.
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.600]   There's possibly a way of being
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:15.760]   that's particularly good at dealing with these static,
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:19.320]   unmoving, or predictable situations,
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.880]   and less so with these rapidly changing social situations.
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:25.960]   And so the way I conceptualize autism
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:31.000]   is these are people whose brains are not so good
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.440]   with the high bit rate, unpredictable information,
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:38.040]   but may be quite good at, given enough time,
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:43.040]   given the grace to work with the system,
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:46.920]   to look at it from different angles,
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:48.980]   to take different perspectives
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:51.360]   with a confidence that it's not changing
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:52.840]   in between perspectives.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:55.640]   That's a brain state that's valuable.
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:59.560]   It's something that has probably has contributed
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.140]   to a lot of the success of the human family,
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:02.340]   being able to design something,
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:07.340]   being able to consider all the different contributions
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:13.280]   to a static, predictable system.
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.760]   - So autism, in a sense,
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.760]   is a spectrum that has identifiable characteristics
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:25.120]   about the way people deal with dynamic information,
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:29.080]   often express itself as social dynamic information.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:29.920]   - But you critically,
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:32.720]   your use of the word often there is really, I think, smart,
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.920]   because it's not just social interaction
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.240]   that is a challenge in autism.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:40.000]   And so many people conceptualize it purely
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.800]   as a social dysfunction disorder,
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.560]   but it's really any unpredictable information
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:49.520]   that's a problem, that's a challenge
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.880]   for people on the spectrum,
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:55.880]   they react very negatively to unexpected sounds,
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.040]   even if not social sounds,
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.160]   unexpected lights, unexpected touches.
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:03.360]   And so it's really unpredictable information
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.040]   that is, in my view, the core problem
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.200]   with the processing in autism, not just social.
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:11.520]   Social just shows up because it's so unpredictable.
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:12.960]   - Yeah, it's so interesting.
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:16.800]   I mean, I try to not to think about that stuff.
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:23.280]   I'm afraid of thinking about disorders and things like that
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:26.640]   because just like I don't like sort of economics
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:30.160]   or game theory, I wanna be careful with it
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.280]   because whenever you have a category or a model,
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.640]   it's too easy to just, for everything,
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.400]   I mean, it's the OCD thing.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:42.200]   I like models too much, I like categories too much.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:44.160]   The moment you acknowledge to yourself,
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:46.320]   well, I have an eating disorder, for example,
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:47.520]   or something like that,
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:51.320]   as opposed to just being, well, I'll just leave it at that
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:54.520]   for my own critical understanding of myself.
[02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:56.960]   Let's just say I don't know how to moderate eating fruit.
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:57.800]   People make fun of me,
[02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:00.760]   they think all fruit is healthy.
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:01.600]   I know.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:05.160]   I don't know how to moderate anything,
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:10.160]   but even fruit, apples and cherries is a nightmare.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:14.360]   Anyway, that's such a psychiatrist thing to say.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.200]   Very interesting.
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:19.640]   But there's characteristics,
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:23.520]   and it's interesting to think about,
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:26.520]   like for example, I have trouble making eye contact,
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:29.000]   but actually, as you said it now,
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000]   it's not that I'm shy at all in that sense.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.520]   It's literally, I'm getting way too much information,
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:40.160]   it's distracting me.
[02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:43.800]   Like I need to just close my eyes so I can,
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:46.560]   like all the things that people seem to be able to do
[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:51.000]   in parallel, it's just, you just asked me a question,
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.280]   for me to think about the answer to that question,
[02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.120]   I can't have all this cool, rich,
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:57.160]   visual information coming my way.
[02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:01.000]   That's literally, 'cause I often close my eyes to think,
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.040]   it's not because I'm afraid of something, whatever,
[02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:06.960]   it's just like too much information happening here.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:08.960]   - Well, that's a beautiful description.
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:12.280]   It's amazing that that is how you experience
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:15.640]   the eye contact aspect.
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:18.780]   I think that's, I mean, you've articulated what,
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:22.600]   captures it for so many people,
[02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:23.720]   which is that it's overwhelming.
[02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:25.440]   There's just too much information
[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:27.680]   just coming in through the eyes.
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:32.560]   And to keep up with it, to know you're gonna be expected
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:35.140]   to keep up with it, first of all, so there's that aspect.
[02:31:35.140 --> 02:31:37.200]   You know, you learned socially
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:38.900]   that there's gonna be an expectation.
[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:40.740]   If you're making eye contact,
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:42.720]   people are gonna think you're keeping up with it,
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.720]   and you don't want to,
[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:46.320]   'cause you wanna focus on other things
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:50.200]   and make progress in other dimensions.
[02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:52.800]   Yeah, and so then there's a strong desire to look away
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:56.960]   or to close the eyes because it's overwhelming,
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:59.240]   it's a distraction, and it's gonna cause errors
[02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:00.200]   of understanding.
[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:02.000]   - And of course, our eyes, that's part,
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.520]   the way we use our eyes is part of the human communication,
[02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:09.520]   so you have to kind of be aware of that element of it.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:12.140]   So yeah, I mean, but it's fascinating.
[02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:13.900]   You should be aware of your own self
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:16.160]   and those little characteristics,
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:19.540]   whether it's classified on some aspect
[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:22.820]   of the autism spectrum or just in general,
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:26.180]   whether it's eating, whether it's depression,
[02:32:26.180 --> 02:32:29.140]   whether it's even like schizophrenia,
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:32.940]   that I hope we get a chance to talk to a little bit.
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:35.400]   Yeah, but those things are all made up
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:40.060]   of different symptoms and characteristics,
[02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:43.380]   and use them as a superpower, I suppose,
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:47.900]   is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I guess.
[02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:50.300]   - I do think both brain states can't coexist
[02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:51.140]   at the same time.
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:52.820]   The way of dealing with something unpredictable
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:55.140]   and dealing with something predictable,
[02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:56.500]   those are different ways of being.
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:33:01.500]   Here's a huge opportunity for very creative model building
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:05.460]   in theoretical neuroscience and linking that
[02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:09.460]   to these data streams we're getting across the brain
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:11.020]   that we talked about earlier,
[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:13.620]   these immense data sets of activity across the brain.
[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:18.220]   Here's where I think there could be a real convergence
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:20.140]   of theoreticians and experimentalists to say,
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:23.040]   okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain,
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.860]   here is what the brain state is likely to be
[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:30.940]   that deals well with unpredictable information,
[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:31.820]   and here's the brain state
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.860]   that deals with predictable information.
[02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:36.540]   Here's why they're incompatible, at least at the same time.
[02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:39.100]   Here's why you've gotta be able to detect
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:40.140]   which state you should be in.
[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:42.300]   Here's how you could switch between them.
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:44.700]   Here's the kind of cells that you would predict,
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:46.540]   almost like predicting the Higgs boson.
[02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:49.540]   Here's the kind of circuitry that I would predict
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:51.820]   should govern the switching
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:55.340]   or might make one state too sticky,
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:56.460]   too hard to get out of.
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:34:01.120]   That is a huge opportunity for an interaction
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:04.300]   from the theoretical and experimental side together.
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:07.300]   - Make one state too sticky.
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:12.620]   The sort of measure the stickiness of the state
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:15.020]   and how to lessen the stickiness.
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:16.540]   Get some oil in the machine.
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:17.940]   - Yes, yeah, what would,
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:20.440]   predict the kind of oil that would work well.
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:27.300]   - What in your practice is treatment or advice
[02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:31.380]   for people on the autism spectrum?
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:34.460]   - So right now there's no real medical treatment.
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:36.580]   There are behavioral treatments
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:38.860]   that are most effective early in life.
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:42.140]   They make sure people don't fall too far behind.
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:43.740]   If you're not interacting socially,
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:46.900]   you create this vicious cycle
[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:48.580]   where you fall farther and farther behind
[02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:49.700]   because you're not interacting.
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:52.680]   And these therapies which are applied early in life,
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.380]   therapists work with the kids,
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:57.860]   train them to deal with these things
[02:34:57.860 --> 02:34:59.860]   that otherwise would be aversive to them,
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:02.660]   teach them how to predict things and interact.
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.820]   And that has a big effect.
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:06.820]   But it's behavioral therapy.
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:08.820]   There's no medicine that works.
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:12.020]   There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though
[02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:13.980]   that sometimes come along with autism
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:15.700]   and those do respond to medications.
[02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:17.820]   So you can, you know, one thing,
[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:21.380]   very often my patients with autism are very anxious
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:23.820]   'cause they live in a world
[02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:25.500]   that they have a really hard time
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.500]   predicting what's gonna happen.
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:29.180]   And so they find, and some of these are high functioning,
[02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:31.500]   you know, Silicon Valley types who, you know,
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:33.860]   they may make, you know, great livings
[02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:37.220]   but they're very unhappy because they're on the spectrum.
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:43.140]   They don't understand how social interactions really work.
[02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:46.220]   They're very anxiety provoking
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:47.220]   'cause they don't know what to say.
[02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:48.380]   They don't have any clue
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:50.940]   how anybody else knows what to say.
[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:52.740]   They're constantly worried they're gonna say something
[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.580]   that's completely inappropriate.
[02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:55.600]   And so they're very anxious.
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:57.460]   And I can treat their anxiety.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:59.700]   It doesn't touch the autism per se
[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:02.500]   but I can help them with their anxiety.
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:05.220]   What I just talked about, eye contact.
[02:36:05.220 --> 02:36:08.260]   I am richly, even with the eyes closed
[02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:09.340]   and all those kinds of things,
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:12.220]   I'm richly experiencing the world.
[02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.420]   And it's not like you're afraid of the world
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:16.060]   or you're not able, I don't know what to do.
[02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:17.420]   No, I know everything.
[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:19.120]   In fact, I know way too much.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:20.820]   There's so many cool options.
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:24.540]   Like at any one moment, there's all this stuff happening
[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:26.180]   and it's all beautiful.
[02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:28.660]   And at any one moment, you can do anything you want.
[02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:29.800]   You can take off your clothes.
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:31.740]   You can punch that guy over there.
[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:33.820]   You can run away.
[02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:35.840]   You can go in for a hug.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.380]   You can say something profound and deep
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:40.000]   or you can say something generic
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.260]   or you could do so many things you can say.
[02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:46.380]   And then it'll go, it'll unravel in all these kinds of ways
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:48.900]   and this moment could be completely life-changing
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:51.300]   or it can be mundane and meaningless.
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:54.520]   And all of those options are before you at any one moment.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.820]   (laughing)
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:57.780]   And so it's like-- - Isn't that amazing?
[02:36:57.780 --> 02:36:59.820]   - It's amazing and overwhelming
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:02.100]   if you allow yourself to think about it.
[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:03.780]   Which-- - It's like chess.
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:05.180]   - Whatever, exactly.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:08.460]   Well, unfortunately, with chess, you have a few set options.
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:11.860]   - Two-dimensional. - Two-dimensional constraints.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:15.140]   There is unlimited possibilities
[02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:18.420]   and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.
[02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:20.520]   So I don't think there's a kind of sense
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:25.520]   that somehow you're limited in the places of,
[02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:29.820]   in the way you can see the world
[02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:31.840]   and how you can interact with that world.
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:35.300]   I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit
[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:37.540]   that all of us should be.
[02:37:37.540 --> 02:37:38.540]   Have you looked around?
[02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:40.180]   You can do whatever the hell you want.
[02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:42.180]   Nobody will remember you anyway.
[02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:44.100]   All of us will be dead one day.
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:45.820]   You could do anything.
[02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:48.620]   You can, I don't know.
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.900]   You can get naked and run around the city
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.700]   as long as you're not hurting anybody
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.580]   and it doesn't matter.
[02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:56.580]   - So it's Austin anyway. - Austin, yeah.
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:59.060]   - Vagabond, exactly.
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:01.780]   Seems like a to-do item
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:04.540]   for anybody living in Austin for sure.
[02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:07.220]   But the spectrum is an interesting concept
[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:10.420]   because that is, when I say,
[02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:12.460]   when I refer to the spectrum,
[02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:15.320]   I'm actually referring to, it's a precise clinical term,
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:17.900]   but you're right, it's been co-opted more broadly
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:19.100]   and it is widely used
[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:22.140]   and it can be an unfair categorization
[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:25.860]   of someone who's socially and occupationally very healthy.
[02:38:25.860 --> 02:38:28.140]   And that is critical
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:32.260]   because we don't define a disorder
[02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:34.740]   unless there's social or occupational dysfunction.
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:36.800]   It doesn't matter what the symptoms are.
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:39.740]   I've had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating,
[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:43.140]   so frankly, psychotic, but doesn't affect their lives.
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:46.380]   So I don't give that person a diagnosis
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:49.960]   because there's not social or occupational dysfunction.
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.660]   Same with anything on this,
[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:57.320]   any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.980]   If someone has them,
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:03.140]   but they're successful socially and occupationally,
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:05.620]   we don't say that there's a disorder.
[02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:06.460]   But then you're right,
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:09.700]   that the concept of the spectrum does become a useful,
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:12.720]   you know, pigeonholing device,
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:14.840]   which is maybe not the best thing.
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:20.020]   - Yeah, and eye contact is an interesting one.
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:21.220]   Is an interesting one.
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:22.260]   I'm torn on it.
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:25.900]   I'm torn about the usefulness of eye contact
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:27.460]   'cause people kind of make fun of it.
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:31.660]   But let me just say one thing about eye contact
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:33.180]   and about life in general.
[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:34.720]   It's okay to be weird.
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:38.140]   But like some people,
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:40.260]   when you have your eyes closed and there's that weird,
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:41.760]   what is happening to this creature?
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:44.860]   Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.
[02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:46.340]   It's interesting.
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:49.120]   And you wanna, I mean, the weird stuff,
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:51.560]   I'm gonna go back to Robin Williams with the,
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:53.780]   that's the good stuff, right?
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:56.380]   He has that whole speech about him and his wife
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:39:59.300]   and what he loves all the little peculiarities,
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:00.780]   all the weird stuff and that,
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:04.220]   like let those flourish.
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.420]   Let those like celebrate those in yourself
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:08.580]   and not in some kind of woke way,
[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:10.940]   but in some like very human way.
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:13.060]   This is what makes us, this is the weirdness.
[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:17.060]   - Yeah, I'm 100% on board with that.
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:19.780]   And I don't think, you know,
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:24.780]   people who are happy and who have people in their lives
[02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:27.120]   who are happy with them,
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.440]   these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:33.280]   Let the, all the different ways
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:35.200]   members of the human family can be different.
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:36.100]   Let's see them all.
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:37.480]   That's one of our,
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:38.800]   that's one of the joys of being alive
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.120]   is seeing all the ways we can be human.
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.920]   And I think about it all the time.
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.980]   Why do we have all these ways of being human?
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:52.980]   And even within one individual,
[02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:54.180]   you go through phases of life
[02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:57.140]   where you express different sides of your way of being,
[02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:59.240]   which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.820]   You can go through phases where you're in one mode
[02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.260]   and phases when you're in another mode.
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:09.700]   And let that, you know, just let that flourish too.
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:13.340]   Let the ways that you can be you vary as well.
[02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:15.740]   I think that's important for people to explore.
[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:19.900]   - And I should, like, as if you can address the internet,
[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:25.340]   but I would like to sort of ask the internet
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:31.420]   to celebrate the weirdness of people.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:35.680]   Like that's, it's the Robin Williams,
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:39.780]   people call these imperfections, but they're not.
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:40.820]   That's the good stuff.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:43.820]   For any one individual person,
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.700]   find the weird stuff and celebrate it
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:50.500]   as opposed to what the internet often does,
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:55.020]   which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.
[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:57.580]   Because when you criticize the weird stuff,
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:01.700]   you're creating conformity, which is another human thing.
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:05.700]   But that conformity creates a boring world.
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.380]   You want the weird.
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:10.780]   You want the crazy.
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:12.500]   That's what fun is made of.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:16.220]   That's the foundation of humor
[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:19.020]   and all the ways in which we deal
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:21.620]   with the suffering in the world,
[02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:23.500]   with the injustices in the world,
[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:28.300]   is like this like huge variety of weird.
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:32.620]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:42:32.620 --> 02:42:35.680]   And that's what at the depth of psychiatry is like,
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.360]   you wanna acknowledge the weird, celebrate the weird,
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:44.360]   like step around it to find the particular aspects
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:47.240]   of weird that are debilitating, like you said.
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:49.600]   They're somehow negatively affecting your ability
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:51.040]   to function in the world,
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.640]   as opposed to trying to shut it all down.
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:55.480]   - That's right.
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:58.400]   - Well, on that topic, I mean,
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:00.640]   I'd love to talk to you about schizophrenia.
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:04.880]   What is schizophrenia?
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:07.600]   From your research and from your general understanding,
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:10.680]   and what is the full landscape of suffering
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:14.980]   and wisdom that schizophrenia explores?
[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:18.400]   - Schizophrenia is a state
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.240]   where there is a break from reality.
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:25.000]   And so this can show up as we call them
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.660]   the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:29.720]   These include hallucinations,
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:32.000]   hearing something or seeing something that's not there,
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.640]   usually auditory hallucinations.
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.440]   Paranoia, people can have complex fears,
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:41.160]   delusions, which we call fixed false beliefs.
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:43.360]   People get an extremely unshakable,
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:46.560]   but completely implausible idea about something.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.840]   Sometimes it relates to themself, sometimes to the world.
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:51.480]   These we call the positive symptoms,
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.220]   break from reality as we know it.
[02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:56.980]   Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it.
[02:43:56.980 --> 02:43:59.800]   And these are progressive.
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.460]   These are flattening of emotion as we call it.
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:07.520]   So starting to express less and less positive emotion,
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.040]   ending more in a neutral or flat state.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:16.520]   Thought disorder, inability to work with complex patterns
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:18.040]   of planning or thinking.
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.200]   So you can't make plans, you'd have poor working memory,
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.420]   you can't keep track of where you were in a conversation,
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:26.900]   in a sequence of actions.
[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:31.960]   So poor and impaired,
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:34.620]   working with the thoughts of oneself
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:37.980]   and then these positive symptoms of break from reality.
[02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:41.080]   Okay, now why do these come together?
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:44.060]   What's the neurobiology of it?
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:45.380]   Again, we don't know.
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:48.020]   Schizophrenia, extremely genetically determined.
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:48.860]   If you look at the numbers,
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:51.920]   could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:57.220]   1% of the human population around the world,
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:44:58.820]   it's universal, okay?
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:00.860]   It's not confined to any one culture,
[02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:04.620]   not even really biased in one culture or another,
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:06.160]   about 1% around the world.
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:12.340]   And has this progressive quality to it, untreated.
[02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:13.500]   So it's very interesting.
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:17.020]   There's a break that happens, we call it first break.
[02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:22.020]   When someone experiences their first disruption of reality,
[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:25.100]   they can have a completely typical life up until that point.
[02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:27.140]   So you might have a, and I've seen,
[02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:29.100]   just heartbreaking cases of like this,
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:31.540]   like this in the Stanford emergency room
[02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.100]   where a kid who's come there,
[02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:36.960]   who's been extremely high functioning
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:39.140]   in that sense of academic achievement
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:41.700]   and athletic and interpersonal,
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:43.300]   and then comes to college.
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:46.860]   Usually in men, it's around 18, 19,
[02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:48.300]   when the first break happens.
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:52.500]   Some terrifying paranoia hits
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:55.260]   or some auditory hallucinations start.
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:45:57.760]   They're getting screamed at by a voice in their head.
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.520]   So devastating.
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.780]   With women, comes on also often a little later,
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:03.960]   sometimes in the 20s.
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:06.120]   And it can be progressive.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:09.620]   If it's not treated, it just progresses and progresses.
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:12.900]   The voices become overwhelming.
[02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:16.740]   The delusions and paranoia extend and expand.
[02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:18.360]   The thought, the negative symptoms particularly
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:20.360]   become more and more severe.
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:23.120]   So one can't even maintain thoughts
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:24.860]   in any sort of ordered fashion.
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:30.040]   And then eventually, it can be fatal,
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.440]   it can lead to suicide,
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:35.480]   it can lead to erratic behavior that leads to accidents.
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:38.880]   Now, it can be treated.
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:42.240]   There are medications that help, fortunately.
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:44.080]   They have side effects, so they're not perfect.
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:46.300]   You can have movement problems
[02:46:46.300 --> 02:46:50.520]   and actually a whole host of different side effects
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:51.640]   that come from the medications.
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.200]   But we can help people now with schizophrenia
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:56.620]   very, very significantly.
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:59.420]   But the amazing thing,
[02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:02.380]   and this is emblematic of where psychiatry stands,
[02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:04.480]   we don't have the deep understanding,
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:05.780]   just like with depression,
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:09.640]   we don't have that heart as a pump level of understanding
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:11.480]   that we'd like to have with schizophrenia,
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.380]   despite it being so biological, so genetic in its nature.
[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:17.740]   - So is there a way once,
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:22.380]   a way to return to the other side of the first break?
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:24.060]   So when you have a break with reality,
[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:26.940]   is there a way to kinda stitch it together?
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:29.500]   - Yeah, so some people, that works.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:32.380]   But we don't really know how.
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:36.100]   So medications, antipsychotic medications, we call them,
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:39.220]   they block a particular neurotransmitter receptor
[02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:44.220]   called the serotonin 2A receptor,
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:46.460]   and they modulate dopamine as well
[02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:48.280]   and other neurotransmitters.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:53.700]   These can take someone who's actively hallucinating,
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:55.140]   actively paranoid,
[02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:57.140]   put them back in a completely normal state,
[02:47:57.140 --> 02:48:01.260]   and some people stay that way indefinitely.
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:04.220]   So you can bring people back from that,
[02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:07.220]   back to the other side, have it stitched together.
[02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:11.900]   More typically, you'll end up in some intermediate state
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:15.420]   where symptoms are reduced powerfully,
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:16.940]   but there might be still something there
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:19.460]   and you've got a drop down in functioning
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:21.980]   that may be persistent for a while.
[02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:26.020]   But concepts, what physically is going on?
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:31.020]   One idea is that it's communication within the brain.
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:34.740]   One part of the brain is not able to tell
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:36.340]   other parts of the brain what it's doing.
[02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:37.980]   And so the auditory hallucinations
[02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:40.200]   are very interesting in this regard.
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:42.060]   They often have this conversational
[02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:44.220]   inner monologue-like quality.
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:45.400]   As we're walking along the street,
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:47.140]   we may have an inner monologue,
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:49.160]   thoughts about what's going on.
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:50.640]   If we see somebody we don't like,
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:52.020]   we may have a thought of,
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:54.100]   wish somebody would punch that guy, something like that,
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:55.260]   or maybe I should punch that guy.
[02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:59.900]   But these are so far below where we would ever act
[02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:02.340]   or even think of acting,
[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:04.380]   but they're just things that come up.
[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:05.980]   And in people with schizophrenia,
[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:09.940]   those inner thoughts, that inner monologue
[02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:14.940]   is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:20.060]   And so it's perceived as something coming from the outside.
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:23.400]   - Or from inside, but from another entity.
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:25.080]   - Another, oh, another entity.
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:27.760]   I thought you meant like another room
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:29.200]   inside the same building.
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:30.040]   - Another room in the--
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:31.840]   - Inside there, yeah.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:35.280]   - And so that's, so it could be conceptualized
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:38.320]   as a communication within the brain problem,
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.880]   notifying another part of the brain what's going on.
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:43.360]   And there's some evidence consistent with that.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:45.760]   - I don't know if you can help with this,
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:48.320]   but I sometimes, 'cause I've been talking
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:50.260]   to quite a few homeless folks recently,
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:54.100]   just, that's what I do is I hang out at night
[02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:59.780]   and talk to interesting people.
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:02.540]   And some of them, and I've known people in the past
[02:50:02.540 --> 02:50:03.900]   who suffer from schizophrenia,
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:07.020]   and some of them, like self, will describe
[02:50:07.020 --> 02:50:11.340]   that as something they suffer from.
[02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:14.380]   And they seem to understand something deeply
[02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:15.860]   about this world.
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:17.960]   I don't know if it's correlated,
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:22.960]   or maybe it's another aspect of depression,
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:27.720]   all those things that I've encountered in my own life,
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:31.600]   is maybe just the struggle and the suffering
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.200]   has taken you through a life
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.600]   where you think deeply about life.
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:39.720]   There's self-reflection that society forces on you
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:43.340]   because it's a disorder of some kind.
[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:45.080]   - It's interesting.
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:47.480]   I guess my only sort of anecdotal observation
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:49.720]   is people who suffer from schizophrenia
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:55.920]   seem to be very interesting and very thoughtful
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:58.340]   in a nonlinear way about the world.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:02.960]   - I've noticed that it's not always positive,
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:06.600]   the unusual ways they view the world.
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:10.000]   But it's always interesting.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.040]   - That could be conspiratorial thinking, too.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.020]   - But the theories they have
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:17.080]   about the way the world functions,
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:20.460]   often very well read, which is also interesting,
[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:22.720]   because they're almost like looking for helpful answers
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:23.640]   from somewhere. - Yes, they are.
[02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:24.520]   Absolutely, they are.
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:26.440]   - And so they might be citing
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:27.920]   some very interesting literature,
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:29.480]   and then using that to,
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:33.440]   there's a stickiness in their mind
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:34.800]   to different models of the world
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:36.640]   and trying to make sense of that world.
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:39.120]   And those models could include conspiracy theories.
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.160]   - Yeah.
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:42.400]   They're very attuned to complexity,
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:44.940]   and they come up with unlikely explanations,
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:48.440]   which is one of the things that makes them,
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:50.520]   it makes it hard for them to function in the world
[02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:52.720]   is how unlikely their explanations are.
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:55.800]   But you're right, there's a depth of consideration
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:58.080]   of the complexity of the world,
[02:51:58.080 --> 02:51:59.600]   and a concern about it,
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:04.640]   and an impulse to work to understand it
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.080]   that is actually quite refreshing.
[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:10.420]   But the first case in the medical literature,
[02:52:11.140 --> 02:52:15.300]   there was a classical schizophrenia.
[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:17.900]   There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews,
[02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:22.380]   who had this, he sketched out for his doctor
[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:26.580]   the experiences he was sensing.
[02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:31.580]   And he drew himself as a cowering figure on the ground,
[02:52:31.580 --> 02:52:35.540]   controlled by a loom, a weaving device
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:39.720]   that was sending threads, long threads, projections,
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.980]   across space from the loom to him,
[02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:44.100]   to his arms and to his body,
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:46.780]   and controlling him from afar.
[02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:51.740]   And he called this the air loom, a loom in the air.
[02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:54.200]   And it was such an evocative thing
[02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:56.640]   because this was the start of the Industrial Revolution,
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:01.300]   or mid, and it was where really industrial strength,
[02:53:01.300 --> 02:53:04.060]   looms and weaving devices were really
[02:53:04.060 --> 02:53:08.660]   kind of the emblematic of the most complex,
[02:53:08.660 --> 02:53:10.860]   powerful technological achievements of the time.
[02:53:10.860 --> 02:53:14.100]   And so that was the explanation available to him
[02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:18.060]   to explain how his body was seemingly moved
[02:53:18.060 --> 02:53:19.380]   without his volition.
[02:53:19.380 --> 02:53:22.900]   And these days, of course, people with schizophrenia
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:26.340]   will have more technology-appropriate interpretations.
[02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:30.940]   They'll have delusions of satellite or alien control
[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:34.140]   or beamed information, very, very common
[02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:37.180]   to have this delusion of a government agency
[02:53:38.180 --> 02:53:41.620]   sending electromagnetic or radio frequency information
[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:43.400]   to control their limbs.
[02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:45.800]   But it's the same thing, whether it's a thread
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:48.300]   from an Industrial Revolution loom,
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:52.860]   or RF radiation, it's the same thing,
[02:53:52.860 --> 02:53:55.380]   just adapted to the moment, explaining,
[02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.220]   trying to explain the world they live in
[02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:58.540]   and their relationship to the world.
[02:53:58.540 --> 02:54:01.180]   - But unconstrained by sort of the thing
[02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:02.780]   that's socially acceptable,
[02:54:02.780 --> 02:54:05.300]   which is both refreshing and dangerous.
[02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:06.140]   - Yes.
[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:08.660]   (sighs)
[02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:10.900]   I wrote down a question.
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:12.000]   Why do we cry?
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:15.200]   Are tears a window to some depths
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.660]   that we ourselves don't know?
[02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:19.620]   I almost wanna make fun of myself for that question,
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:22.620]   but you do talk seriously about crying in the book.
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:25.060]   - In fact, the whole first chapter really,
[02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:27.860]   really tussles with crying as a,
[02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:29.260]   why do we do it, what does it mean,
[02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:30.980]   why is it involuntary?
[02:54:30.980 --> 02:54:32.300]   It seems like a weakness, right?
[02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:34.220]   It's because it's so involuntary,
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:36.740]   and it's reflecting something true and inside.
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:39.140]   At the level of the individual,
[02:54:39.140 --> 02:54:40.500]   that seems like a problem, right?
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:42.600]   Wouldn't it be better if we could control it,
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:46.980]   if we could not show that emotion
[02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:49.500]   when it's not useful, show it when it's useful?
[02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:51.820]   But it's not, it's largely involuntary.
[02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:55.560]   And so there's a value to it, I think,
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:58.700]   as an honest reporter of a need,
[02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:03.540]   of hope and frailty at the same time.
[02:55:03.540 --> 02:55:08.540]   I'm a human being, there's a frailty to myself
[02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:12.340]   or my situation where I need social help,
[02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:14.740]   I need help from my community.
[02:55:14.740 --> 02:55:16.800]   I have hope that that is possible,
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:21.580]   but I'm not enough for myself, I need the community.
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:25.460]   That, I think, is what the social signal of crying is.
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:27.060]   Now, people have studied crying.
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:31.860]   It's an extreme, you can quantify the extent
[02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:34.860]   to which the presence of tears on a face
[02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:37.940]   triggers reactions in onlookers.
[02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.460]   And you can show the same face
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:42.460]   in the presence or absence of tears,
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:45.540]   and show that to people under quantifiable
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:49.380]   and rigorous psychological conditions.
[02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:52.260]   And tears are much more powerful
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:57.060]   at stirring the desire to help in viewers
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:56:01.140]   than any other facial feature,
[02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:04.060]   which is pretty interesting that it's the honest one
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:05.680]   that's also the most powerful, right?
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:08.780]   It kind of indicates there's a certain logic to our design
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:14.580]   as social beings that we have an honest report.
[02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:17.180]   - That's hard to control.
[02:56:17.180 --> 02:56:21.580]   But is it well understood how that connects
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:26.380]   to the internal state of emotion?
[02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:30.520]   - Yeah, there are long-range projections that come.
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:31.860]   So where is crying generated?
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:33.260]   This is the confusing thing about it.
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:36.640]   So we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland,
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:38.860]   that leads to the release of fluid, it ejects fluid,
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:42.160]   and it comes out, and those, of course,
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.660]   that whole system was designed to keep the eye clean,
[02:56:44.660 --> 02:56:47.060]   to wash out particulate irritants.
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:49.800]   So it's a longstanding, as long as we've had eyes
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:52.860]   and have been out of the water in our evolution,
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:53.980]   we've needed this sort of thing.
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:56.160]   So longstanding biological structure,
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:00.000]   recently co-opted, it seems, by our evolution
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.060]   as social primates.
[02:57:02.060 --> 02:57:03.900]   Now, how could that happen?
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:07.580]   Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:10.320]   in the pons, which is a structure deep in our,
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:14.140]   just above our neck, between our neck and our head,
[02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:16.800]   and reflecting its ancient origin, right?
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:18.620]   As you go farther down toward the spinal cord,
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:21.860]   these are the more basic, early evolved structures.
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:25.300]   And in the pons, that's where breathing is controlled,
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:30.300]   tear, duct contraction.
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:34.040]   And what we found, and with optogenetics,
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:36.800]   we helped sort this out, there are long-range projections
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:41.000]   from fear and anxiety regions in the forebrain
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.400]   that project all the way to the pons,
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:45.400]   in and around those areas.
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:47.720]   The reason those are there, we think,
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:50.760]   is to regulate the respiratory rate changes,
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:53.000]   the breathing changes of fear and anxiety.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.740]   So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety,
[02:57:55.740 --> 02:57:58.860]   we need, we cope better if we have elevated heart rate,
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:01.500]   elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around,
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:03.700]   more oxygenated blood, we're ready to meet the threat
[02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:05.060]   if it happens.
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:07.540]   All those cells are down there in the pons too,
[02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:12.540]   right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons.
[02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:17.540]   And so, almost certainly, this fear-anxiety-induced crying
[02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:22.520]   arose from a very slightly misdirected
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:27.520]   long-range projection that was there to regulate breathing.
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:29.800]   And a little twist, just a little misdirection,
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:33.640]   a little missing of one sign post to stop here,
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:36.800]   going on a little farther, getting to the lacrimal gland
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:38.880]   neurons gave us crying.
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:40.400]   - And that's, and we just have it,
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:43.680]   that peculiar sort of structure, neuronal structure
[02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:46.640]   that resulted in that, that's what we're stuck with.
[02:58:46.640 --> 02:58:49.980]   And that ends up being, in terms of social interaction,
[02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:54.980]   one of the more important authentic involuntary displays
[02:58:54.980 --> 02:58:57.020]   of inner state.
[02:58:57.020 --> 02:58:57.860]   - That's right.
[02:58:57.860 --> 02:58:58.980]   - And social communication.
[02:58:58.980 --> 02:58:59.820]   - Yeah.
[02:58:59.820 --> 02:59:00.640]   (laughing)
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:02.420]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:03.980]   Is there other stuff like that?
[02:59:03.980 --> 02:59:07.380]   I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face
[02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:09.660]   is fascinating as a display of emotion,
[02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:12.300]   as a display of truth and lying
[02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:13.900]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:59:13.900 --> 02:59:18.900]   I personally, I mean, we're all, I suppose,
[02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:24.160]   have different sensors that are sensitive
[02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:25.760]   to certain aspects of the human face,
[02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:28.360]   but to me, it seems like the eyes
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:31.280]   are really important communication or something.
[02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:33.160]   You know, I've talked to a few sort of girls
[02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:35.320]   about like Botox and stuff like that,
[02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:37.600]   and it always bothers me when,
[02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:38.800]   I guess guys could do this too,
[02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:43.440]   but like when women speak negatively
[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:46.300]   of, I guess you can call them wrinkles
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:50.780]   at the tips of an eye, but like to me,
[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:55.180]   when you smile, when you, not wink,
[02:59:55.180 --> 02:59:59.300]   but like narrow the eyes, something is communicated,
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:03.100]   and that stuff is really useful, the human face.
[03:00:03.100 --> 03:00:05.500]   And when it's gone, something is missing.
[03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:08.540]   And a lot of little stuff, it feels like can really,
[03:00:08.540 --> 03:00:10.660]   it's almost involuntary, I guess,
[03:00:10.660 --> 03:00:12.860]   but it's harder to describe as the presence
[03:00:12.860 --> 03:00:13.900]   or absence of tears.
[03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:16.600]   It's like something about this person,
[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:18.820]   you can tell they're not bullshitting you.
[03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:19.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:19.660 --> 03:00:21.940]   And so that was what made, presumably,
[03:00:21.940 --> 03:00:24.860]   that tear recruitment so powerful,
[03:00:24.860 --> 03:00:28.420]   is it just landed in this very high-value real estate
[03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:29.780]   for social communication.
[03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:33.020]   If it had gone to, you know, there's a lot of neurons
[03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:38.020]   in the pons that control movement of large muscles,
[03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:41.620]   elsewhere, that would have been much less effective
[03:00:41.620 --> 03:00:43.460]   as a social signal than something around the eye.
[03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:46.820]   So it was, however that little misdirection happened,
[03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:50.420]   it landed in a great area for social communication.
[03:00:50.420 --> 03:00:53.420]   And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits
[03:00:53.420 --> 03:00:57.020]   that regulate that necessary involuntary change
[03:00:57.020 --> 03:00:59.660]   in heart rate and respiratory rate,
[03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:02.460]   it also was involuntary, and that became valuable
[03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:05.900]   as a truth signal as social beings.
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:08.940]   So very interesting when you think about the origins
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:12.500]   of the human family, origins of social structures
[03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:14.940]   and our ability and need to call for help
[03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:18.100]   when there's hope, but need at the same time.
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:23.100]   - What is consciousness, Carl?
[03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:26.580]   So you're actually using techniques,
[03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:28.420]   I mean, even putting psychiatry aside,
[03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:31.820]   just looking at optogenetics,
[03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:34.460]   you're trying to understand some of these deep aspects
[03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:36.100]   of the human mind.
[03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:38.420]   And maybe this is a good time to return to a question
[03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:41.220]   you mentioned you might have an opinion on,
[03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:43.300]   if there's such a thing as a theory of everything
[03:01:43.300 --> 03:01:44.980]   for the human mind.
[03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:47.820]   Because surely answering of what is consciousness
[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:50.980]   is as, well, that's not sure.
[03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:53.540]   But it seems like it's a fundamental part
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:56.220]   of the human experience in the human mind
[03:01:56.220 --> 03:02:00.740]   and solving that question will result in solving
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:02.660]   the bigger thing about the human mind.
[03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:05.020]   The flip side could be consciousness
[03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:07.700]   is just the few neurons that are generating
[03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:10.100]   some useful thing that make us,
[03:02:10.100 --> 03:02:14.220]   it's like the sense of self that you talked about
[03:02:14.220 --> 03:02:18.660]   in the mice, maybe it's a subset of those cells
[03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:21.140]   that are just creating a richer sense of self,
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:21.980]   and that's it.
[03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:26.260]   - So this is a great question.
[03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:28.100]   All neuroscientists think about this
[03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:29.860]   and a lot of non-neuroscientists too.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.900]   It's such a, it's the reason a lot of people
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:34.540]   came to the study of the brain,
[03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:36.100]   is to think about consciousness.
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:38.380]   And not just being awake or alert,
[03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:40.500]   but really what's sometimes called
[03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:42.260]   the hard problem of consciousness,
[03:02:42.260 --> 03:02:45.260]   which is what is that nature of that
[03:02:45.260 --> 03:02:47.820]   inner subjective sense we have?
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:50.180]   Not just information processing,
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:54.380]   but feeling something about the information.
[03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:59.140]   What is that inner state of subjectivity physically?
[03:02:59.140 --> 03:02:59.980]   What is it?
[03:02:59.980 --> 03:03:03.380]   And that's called the hard problem of consciousness.
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:08.380]   And it's not a extremely well-defined question.
[03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:11.380]   Everybody has sort of a sense of what it means,
[03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:14.260]   but it's such a hard problem
[03:03:14.260 --> 03:03:17.180]   because you run into paradoxes quite quickly
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:18.500]   the more you think about it.
[03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:21.860]   And that is exciting also,
[03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:23.380]   because it makes us think,
[03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:25.140]   actually there's some fundamental,
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:28.180]   there's a big thing that we're missing.
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:30.940]   The brain is not just a collection of little tricks.
[03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:32.820]   There is a big, big concept.
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:34.020]   - So that's your sense of the big,
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:37.780]   'cause a flip side could be with optogenetics.
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:40.340]   There's an engineering question.
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:43.060]   Can you turn consciousness on and off,
[03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:43.940]   like a light switch?
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:47.220]   - Okay, so here's where exactly consciousness
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:48.940]   frames the problem extremely well.
[03:03:48.940 --> 03:03:50.620]   And it frames it the following way.
[03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:54.100]   So I told you earlier that we can
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:59.100]   stimulate 20 or 25 cells in the visual cortex of a mouse,
[03:03:59.100 --> 03:04:01.820]   and we can make it behave,
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:03.500]   and we can make its brain act
[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:06.060]   as if it's seeing something that isn't there.
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:07.260]   We have that level of control now.
[03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:10.940]   We can pick out 25 neurons, play an activity,
[03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:13.080]   and both behavior and in the brain,
[03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:16.140]   it's as if it's seeing something specific.
[03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:18.620]   Okay, now let's do a thought experiment,
[03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:20.600]   you know, a Gedanken experiment,
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:21.860]   and let's play this out.
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:24.380]   Let's say we could do the same thing
[03:04:24.380 --> 03:04:27.860]   for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.
[03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:30.100]   Let's say we had total control,
[03:04:30.100 --> 03:04:31.540]   and I could do something like,
[03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:34.820]   I could show you a rich, deep color red,
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:35.740]   and you could look at it,
[03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:36.980]   and you would be aware that it's red,
[03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:39.300]   but also you might have some feelings about it.
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:40.320]   Something would be stirred in you,
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:43.500]   some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red.
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:48.880]   And then I would take away the visual stimulus,
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:50.340]   and I would, in this thought experiment,
[03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:53.300]   I would, using some hyperoptogenetics,
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:57.020]   I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity
[03:04:57.020 --> 03:05:00.360]   in every cell in your brain for as long as was needed,
[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:02.460]   whatever, 15 seconds, something like that,
[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:06.900]   that exactly matched what was going on
[03:05:06.900 --> 03:05:10.340]   when you were feeling that inner subjective sense.
[03:05:10.340 --> 03:05:12.180]   Okay, so in that thought experiment,
[03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:13.540]   a question for you is,
[03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:18.100]   would you be feeling that same inner subjective sense?
[03:05:18.100 --> 03:05:20.540]   Stimulus is gone, every neuron's doing the same thing
[03:05:20.540 --> 03:05:21.840]   'cause I'm controlling it.
[03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:25.820]   - There's a philosophical question there.
[03:05:25.820 --> 03:05:29.360]   If you ask me specifically, I would say yes.
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:31.420]   - Okay, good, most people would say that
[03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:33.740]   because it's hard to say no, right?
[03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:34.820]   - It's very hard to say no.
[03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:38.260]   - If every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing,
[03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:39.540]   what else could be different?
[03:05:39.540 --> 03:05:40.380]   How could--
[03:05:40.380 --> 03:05:42.700]   - Well, most normal people would say yes.
[03:05:42.700 --> 03:05:46.340]   Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.
[03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:48.220]   They're the ones that say,
[03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:52.620]   I'm gonna sort of, to parallel,
[03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:54.220]   and sorry if it's a bit of an interruption,
[03:05:54.220 --> 03:05:58.420]   but if there's a robot that's conscious in front of you,
[03:05:58.420 --> 03:06:02.900]   if it appears conscious, then it's conscious.
[03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:07.300]   Like to me, of course, philosophers again speak up
[03:06:07.300 --> 03:06:10.020]   and say, well, no, how do you know it's conscious?
[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:12.340]   Well, how do you know anything is conscious?
[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:15.460]   And sort of as normal humans,
[03:06:15.460 --> 03:06:19.140]   we tend to lean on the experience
[03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:22.640]   versus some kind of philosophical concept.
[03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:25.300]   - So the great thing about what you just said,
[03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:28.380]   the Turing test, is it's very practical.
[03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:30.980]   If it acts conscious, it is conscious.
[03:06:30.980 --> 03:06:32.860]   But I think that's limiting.
[03:06:32.860 --> 03:06:34.740]   I like the thought experiment.
[03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:36.220]   I think it's actually more informative.
[03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:39.760]   And so I'm halfway to the conclusion there.
[03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:42.780]   But let's take it as your answer was yes,
[03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:44.900]   that you would be feeling the same thing.
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:47.100]   Okay, now here's where it gets fun.
[03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:51.860]   Now that every cell in your brain
[03:06:51.860 --> 03:06:56.940]   knows what it has to do in the sense that we know it
[03:06:56.940 --> 03:06:58.100]   and we're providing it,
[03:06:58.100 --> 03:07:02.660]   your brain cells don't need to be in your head
[03:07:02.660 --> 03:07:04.740]   anymore at all, right?
[03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:06.500]   The only reason they're next to each other,
[03:07:06.500 --> 03:07:08.180]   the only reason they're wired together
[03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:12.260]   is to affect each other, to stimulate or inhibit each other.
[03:07:12.260 --> 03:07:15.320]   But we don't need that anymore 'cause optogenetically,
[03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:17.300]   we're providing that activity pattern
[03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:18.140]   for as long as needed.
[03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:20.060]   We're providing the effect of the communication.
[03:07:20.060 --> 03:07:22.620]   They don't need to be connected anymore.
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:24.520]   They don't even need to be in your head.
[03:07:24.520 --> 03:07:28.100]   I could spread your neurons all over the continent,
[03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:29.220]   all over the galaxy,
[03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:34.060]   and I could still provide the same stimulus pattern
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:36.780]   over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons.
[03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:41.600]   And somewhere, Lex Friedman would have to be,
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:45.300]   even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore,
[03:07:45.300 --> 03:07:48.260]   would be feeling that subjective feeling.
[03:07:48.260 --> 03:07:50.640]   And it's inescapable because it's exactly the same
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:52.060]   as the previous situation.
[03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:54.420]   All the neurons have to be spatially,
[03:07:54.420 --> 03:07:56.880]   like the locality constraint,
[03:07:56.880 --> 03:07:58.940]   they have to be spatially close to each other.
[03:07:58.940 --> 03:08:03.700]   And you talk about light, Opto,
[03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:08.700]   which is funny because light is the fastest traveling thing
[03:08:08.700 --> 03:08:10.340]   that we know of.
[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:13.060]   - Maybe let's not put 'em all over the universe
[03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:14.660]   'cause we might get relativistic problems then.
[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:16.940]   Let's just keep them, let's keep all your neurons,
[03:08:16.940 --> 03:08:19.220]   let's spread 'em over North America, okay?
[03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:22.660]   And let's play them out, same pattern of activity.
[03:08:22.660 --> 03:08:24.180]   And it seems absurd, right?
[03:08:24.180 --> 03:08:25.920]   There's no way that could be true.
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:28.700]   There's no way that Lex would be feeling
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:30.300]   that internal sense if his neurons
[03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:32.760]   were spread all over North America.
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:35.140]   And yet, it's exactly the same as the previous situation
[03:08:35.140 --> 03:08:36.700]   where you said, "Sure."
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:37.980]   - Wow. - So we got a paradox.
[03:08:37.980 --> 03:08:39.540]   And this is what makes people think--
[03:08:39.540 --> 03:08:40.380]   - Is this a paradox, though?
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:42.180]   Sorry, you-- - Well, maybe paradox
[03:08:42.180 --> 03:08:43.020]   is the wrong word.
[03:08:43.020 --> 03:08:43.980]   We got a problem. (laughs)
[03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:46.100]   We got a problem because it reveals
[03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:49.860]   that there's something big about those,
[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:53.100]   that internal subjective state that we're not explaining.
[03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:54.700]   And we don't really have a hope of explaining
[03:08:54.700 --> 03:08:55.700]   in the near future.
[03:08:55.700 --> 03:08:58.660]   - But don't you think we would still have that?
[03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:00.580]   It's just the word internal loses meaning,
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:02.200]   but don't you think we still have
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:03.820]   that internal subjective state?
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:09.540]   If not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?
[03:09:09.540 --> 03:09:12.460]   Okay, well, I just think,
[03:09:13.460 --> 03:09:16.820]   I think one of the problems
[03:09:16.820 --> 03:09:19.140]   that I think we need to let go of
[03:09:19.140 --> 03:09:23.460]   is we tend to, outside of the experience of consciousness,
[03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:25.700]   the hard problem of consciousness,
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:27.940]   we tend to think that we individual humans
[03:09:27.940 --> 03:09:29.180]   are really special.
[03:09:29.180 --> 03:09:33.200]   Not the subjective experience, but the entirety of it,
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:35.780]   like the body that contains the thing.
[03:09:35.780 --> 03:09:40.780]   So the local, the constraint of all the stuff
[03:09:40.820 --> 03:09:43.320]   has to be together and it's all mine.
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:45.020]   (laughs)
[03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:48.660]   That's a very, I don't know if that has anything to do
[03:09:48.660 --> 03:09:51.980]   with the mechanisms that are creating this.
[03:09:51.980 --> 03:09:55.460]   So, and in fact, one really nice way
[03:09:55.460 --> 03:10:00.460]   to break through that is to either observe
[03:10:00.460 --> 03:10:06.020]   or create consciousness that spans multiple organisms.
[03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:10.780]   Sort of, like, let's say it's not,
[03:10:10.780 --> 03:10:15.140]   it's not an organism-dependent phenomena.
[03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:17.540]   That the phenomena can,
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:22.140]   that's just a peculiar way it has evolved on Earth,
[03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:26.300]   but it's a phenomena that doesn't have anything to do
[03:10:26.300 --> 03:10:30.500]   with a specific biological system.
[03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:35.780]   - Yeah, so, and we have different parts of our brain exist,
[03:10:35.780 --> 03:10:40.780]   and sometimes create complex awarenesses of things
[03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:46.380]   that involve different neurons that are distributed widely,
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:49.020]   and that need to communicate with each other
[03:10:49.020 --> 03:10:51.240]   to form this joint representation,
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:53.140]   this state of consciousness.
[03:10:53.140 --> 03:10:57.300]   But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?
[03:10:57.300 --> 03:11:01.260]   We don't know why that would be the case that they do.
[03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:06.640]   And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field,
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:11.640]   is what is it that binds the activity of neurons together
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:14.440]   so they can form a joint representation?
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:16.840]   And actually, this comes back to the dissociation experiment
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:18.560]   we talked about before, where you can,
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.440]   your sense of self becomes separated from your body.
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:26.600]   Those things that were fused in a joint representation,
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:29.880]   the same concept, unitary, are now separate.
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:35.440]   And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:37.160]   showing how this could be.
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:41.000]   We used optogenetics to drive this rhythm
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:44.000]   that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex,
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:47.480]   and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:49.360]   and when they were active,
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.680]   never able to be active at the same time,
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:56.120]   never able to form a joint representation at the same time.
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:11:58.080]   And so we've got a toehold into these questions.
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:11:59.920]   We don't have the answers, but--
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:02.600]   - And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:04.280]   - Exactly, exactly.
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:06.760]   - And you're able to find that kind of oscillation,
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:09.920]   the wow, wow, wow.
[03:12:09.920 --> 03:12:13.520]   And so if you get even greater and greater control
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:16.000]   with more control over individual neurons
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:19.840]   and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons
[03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:24.520]   that having some role to play in the sense of self,
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:26.200]   you can play like an orchestra.
[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:31.720]   That to create certain degrees of consciousness,
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:33.240]   degrees of subjectivity,
[03:12:33.240 --> 03:12:36.800]   and thereby understand what is consciousness
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:41.960]   by having a very complicated light switch, essentially.
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:43.400]   - And here's the challenge,
[03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:46.360]   is the nice thing about the thought experiment
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:48.240]   is it kind of highlights
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:51.760]   that we're gonna hit a point where
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:57.400]   we're addressing some very, very fundamental questions.
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:02.400]   What allows the activity of two sets of neurons
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:07.080]   to become mutually relevant to each other?
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:09.600]   This is in some ways,
[03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:12.360]   maybe one of the deepest remaining questions
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:15.520]   in neuroscience is what allows activity patterns
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:18.880]   to become relevant to each other?
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:21.200]   Do they have to be in sync temporally?
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:22.460]   Do they need to be,
[03:13:22.460 --> 03:13:26.880]   is there some other quality that we don't know about
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:28.440]   that also needs to be present
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:32.120]   to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?
[03:13:32.120 --> 03:13:34.040]   - Just so I understand,
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:39.040]   'cause it feels close to some very, very deep idea.
[03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:43.600]   So there's a bunch of semi-distributed signals
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:44.820]   going on in the brain.
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:50.240]   And you're saying there could be
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:53.800]   something like a theory of everything, if one to exist,
[03:13:53.800 --> 03:13:56.160]   is to understand why,
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:13:59.560]   how and why signals close to each other
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:05.320]   start becoming relevant to each other.
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:07.040]   - That's right, that's right.
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:10.880]   - As part of some very much bigger signal
[03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:12.440]   that they're producing.
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.960]   How they coordinate, essentially.
[03:14:14.960 --> 03:14:18.440]   'Cause it's very distributed.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:20.680]   I mean, that's a kind of,
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:24.260]   within a distributed system, how is order achieved?
[03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:28.840]   And this is a very specific kind of distributed system
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:31.000]   that is one of the most intelligent
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.880]   that we're aware of in the known universe.
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:37.000]   In that would maybe be something,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:42.000]   also an understanding of the full conscious experience, too.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.440]   That this kind of coordination,
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:46.640]   how does the coordination between different neurons
[03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:49.060]   that are responsible for sense of self,
[03:14:49.060 --> 03:14:51.760]   how do they begin to form a big picture
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:54.080]   that we see as a human experience?
[03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:55.520]   That's really, really interesting.
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:57.080]   So uniting the small,
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:14:58.320]   (laughs)
[03:14:58.320 --> 03:15:00.960]   that's actually literally theory of everything.
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:03.840]   Uniting the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron,
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:07.800]   the function of the neuron with the big,
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:12.040]   just the functioning of the entire mind.
[03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:12.880]   - That's right.
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:14.920]   And I think keeping a toehold in both
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:17.800]   at the cellular level of resolution
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:19.720]   and the brain-wide resolution will be critical.
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:21.320]   If you lose touch with either,
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:23.580]   I think you'll miss the big insight.
[03:15:23.580 --> 03:15:25.380]   So that's what we're trying to do,
[03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:29.180]   keeping grounded in the cellular resolution,
[03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:32.180]   trying to keep the broadest brain-wide perspective
[03:15:32.180 --> 03:15:33.340]   and meet in the middle.
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:36.900]   - Do you think you'll see it in your lifetime,
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:39.540]   a major breakthrough in that dimension?
[03:15:39.540 --> 03:15:40.940]   - I have hope, I have hope.
[03:15:40.940 --> 03:15:43.780]   It's very hard to predict what will happen
[03:15:43.780 --> 03:15:45.460]   with big things like this.
[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:46.880]   If we don't get there,
[03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:49.780]   there'll be plenty of other exciting stuff, so it's okay.
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:52.920]   - But the other aspect of this whole thing
[03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:55.200]   is that your life is pretty short.
[03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:56.880]   - That's true.
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:15:59.440]   - So first of all, you can die any day.
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:01.320]   I tend to try to think about that,
[03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:03.880]   that it ends, you can end at any moment
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:05.640]   because it really, really can.
[03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:08.760]   And if not, it'll be soon anyway.
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:09.960]   Do you think about that?
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:12.280]   Do you think about your mortality?
[03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:13.120]   - I do, yeah.
[03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:16.020]   It comes back to what we talked about earlier.
[03:16:16.020 --> 03:16:18.500]   I never think I've done enough,
[03:16:18.500 --> 03:16:20.780]   and it's relevant to that, for sure.
[03:16:20.780 --> 03:16:23.540]   - There's a deadline.
[03:16:23.540 --> 03:16:25.060]   - Yeah.
[03:16:25.060 --> 03:16:27.180]   - Do you think there's ever going to be a feeling
[03:16:27.180 --> 03:16:31.700]   where you sit back and you're really proud of yourself?
[03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:35.300]   - I hope so.
[03:16:35.300 --> 03:16:38.380]   - Like, I've done enough, I've done everything there is.
[03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:43.160]   Because the thing is, a warrior has some number
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:45.840]   of battles in them, and at a certain point,
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:47.480]   if you're deeply honest, it's like,
[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:50.240]   well, that was a pretty good run.
[03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:53.040]   As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.
[03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:55.240]   And you can hang up your helmet,
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:17:00.240]   and then go sort of drink some ale,
[03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:03.600]   listen to some music with the old lady,
[03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:04.920]   and say, I did pretty good.
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:06.280]   You think you'll get there?
[03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:10.340]   - You know, with something,
[03:17:10.340 --> 03:17:12.980]   nature always has surprises for us.
[03:17:12.980 --> 03:17:17.400]   The curious mind is always after more.
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:22.120]   But biology gives us other rewards.
[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:25.000]   Children, and family, community.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:28.420]   And one can feel good about those things.
[03:17:28.420 --> 03:17:31.740]   - Biology's full of rewards,
[03:17:31.740 --> 03:17:34.780]   but do you think, about those rewards,
[03:17:34.780 --> 03:17:37.040]   what do you think is the why of those rewards?
[03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:38.460]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:17:38.460 --> 03:17:40.180]   And this existence?
[03:17:40.180 --> 03:17:44.500]   What's the why of biology?
[03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:45.460]   What does it want from us?
[03:17:45.460 --> 03:17:47.980]   Why are all these cells very busy
[03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:50.500]   putting together an organism that seems to want to
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:53.660]   just be in a hurry to do stuff?
[03:17:53.660 --> 03:17:55.180]   And survive?
[03:17:55.180 --> 03:17:57.580]   But it also just doesn't, it's not happy being survived.
[03:17:57.580 --> 03:17:59.220]   Like you said, it's curious.
[03:17:59.220 --> 03:18:01.620]   It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.
[03:18:01.620 --> 03:18:02.980]   Why?
[03:18:02.980 --> 03:18:06.860]   - Yeah, that, you know, we're clearly designed for that.
[03:18:06.860 --> 03:18:10.700]   This is, we're clearly designed to ask why and to answer.
[03:18:10.700 --> 03:18:12.900]   And that, I think, is,
[03:18:12.900 --> 03:18:15.300]   I don't know the meaning of all life.
[03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:17.900]   I think a meaning of our lives is that,
[03:18:17.900 --> 03:18:21.540]   and this is the Aristotelian happiness.
[03:18:21.540 --> 03:18:24.340]   This is, an organism is happy, an animal's happy
[03:18:24.340 --> 03:18:26.420]   if it's performing to its design, right?
[03:18:26.420 --> 03:18:29.740]   If it's doing what it was made for.
[03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:30.580]   - Yeah.
[03:18:30.580 --> 03:18:33.680]   Well, you have to understand, what's the design?
[03:18:33.680 --> 03:18:38.680]   And, you know, who is the designer?
[03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:41.980]   And what were they up to?
[03:18:41.980 --> 03:18:43.820]   And how hard is it?
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:45.180]   Do you have to build the whole universe?
[03:18:45.180 --> 03:18:47.640]   And does the design even know what the hell they're doing?
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:51.700]   Because, you know, maybe the designer built humans
[03:18:51.700 --> 03:18:56.500]   to find out about themselves.
[03:18:56.500 --> 03:18:57.500]   That's what I would do.
[03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:00.740]   Like, if I had the power to build clones,
[03:19:00.740 --> 03:19:02.500]   I would build a lot of clones
[03:19:02.500 --> 03:19:04.840]   and I would get them into different trouble
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:09.840]   to understand, like, what's this body designed to do?
[03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:11.700]   - How far can I go that way?
[03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:12.900]   - Exactly.
[03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:15.640]   And then I dissociate myself completely
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:19.100]   from having any way to know, like, that I know that person.
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:19.980]   - Oh, that's good.
[03:19:19.980 --> 03:19:21.300]   - I mean, I suppose you could do that
[03:19:21.300 --> 03:19:25.100]   in a single person's body by dissociation.
[03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:29.300]   But I do wonder what,
[03:19:30.180 --> 03:19:33.780]   if you look at Earth as a collection of humans,
[03:19:33.780 --> 03:19:35.900]   as a collection of biological organisms,
[03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:38.980]   it seems that we're busy doing something.
[03:19:38.980 --> 03:19:45.400]   And it just seems too beautiful and too special
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:47.580]   to be a random,
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:51.660]   a random experiment.
[03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:55.700]   It seems like it's an experiment that's cleverly designed
[03:19:58.060 --> 03:20:00.660]   by some forces of nature
[03:20:00.660 --> 03:20:03.700]   that are beyond our current understanding.
[03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:05.540]   And maybe that's part of our design,
[03:20:05.540 --> 03:20:06.540]   is to keep asking why.
[03:20:06.540 --> 03:20:07.380]   You said answer.
[03:20:07.380 --> 03:20:10.380]   I'm not sure that's part of the design, the answer.
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:15.060]   I think we're given just the sufficiently limited
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:19.020]   cognitive capability that we know how to long
[03:20:19.020 --> 03:20:22.500]   to find the answer and we lack the ability
[03:20:22.500 --> 03:20:24.100]   to find the answer.
[03:20:24.100 --> 03:20:26.460]   That's basically a summary of your career.
[03:20:26.460 --> 03:20:27.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[03:20:27.820 --> 03:20:29.540]   And then we give each other Nobel prizes
[03:20:29.540 --> 03:20:33.220]   for having even an inkling of a good step
[03:20:33.220 --> 03:20:35.140]   towards the right direction.
[03:20:35.140 --> 03:20:37.260]   Carl, you're an incredible human being.
[03:20:37.260 --> 03:20:41.020]   I'm a huge fan of who you are as a person,
[03:20:41.020 --> 03:20:43.560]   who you are as a scientist, who you are as a writer.
[03:20:43.560 --> 03:20:45.340]   I just thank you so much.
[03:20:45.340 --> 03:20:46.740]   I'm so honored that you would sit down
[03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:47.580]   and talk to me today.
[03:20:47.580 --> 03:20:48.400]   It was amazing.
[03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:49.860]   - It's been incredibly fun.
[03:20:49.860 --> 03:20:50.700]   Let's do it again sometime.
[03:20:50.700 --> 03:20:51.780]   - Let's do it again. - It's been really great.
[03:20:51.780 --> 03:20:55.660]   Your insights and wit and modesty
[03:20:55.660 --> 03:20:58.260]   are really quite rewarding.
[03:20:58.260 --> 03:20:59.360]   - Thanks so much, man.
[03:20:59.360 --> 03:21:02.060]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:21:02.060 --> 03:21:03.700]   with Carl Deisseroth.

[03:21:11.540 --> 03:21:13.980]   Knowing your own darkness is the best method
[03:21:13.980 --> 03:21:16.380]   for dealing with the darkness of other people.
[03:21:16.380 --> 03:21:20.460]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
