[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Let's talk about emotions, both theory and practice.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   And if we can place it in the context of parenting, that would be great, but I'm certain that
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.240]   this has a broader theme that pertains to everybody.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.600]   So I love the theory of emotions or how we would theoretically respond to something,
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.160]   but then there's the reality.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.320]   So as a parent, let's say you have a stance in your home and in your family that it's
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.200]   okay to be sad, like sadness is normal, it happens, it passes, etc., but let's say you're
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.620]   feeling particularly sad about something.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520]   Do you express that and show that in front of your kids?
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.960]   Because I've also heard that young kids, in particular younger than eight or nine, perhaps
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.800]   shouldn't be aware that their parents are experiencing, say, extreme sadness because
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.640]   it can be scary to them or they might feel like their world is destabilizing.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.320]   And then we also hear a lot about kids feeling like they had to parent the parents, and then
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.760]   this whole thing becomes pretty complicated.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.800]   So while there's no perfect world where one knows what to do every single time, how do
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.520]   you look at this business of modeling emotions and also encouraging kids to be able to experience
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.000]   and express their emotions?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.800]   Yeah, and I think everything I'm about to share applies in the workplace, right?
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.500]   Can a boss be, you know, really upset in front of the person they manage, management, right?
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080]   So it's all the same stuff.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.520]   So I guess zooming out as a start, emotions are normal, emotions are unstoppable.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.480]   You can't not feel sad just because you have your five-year-old in the room, right?
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.120]   And I think the other thing that kind of forms my perspective is it's really hard to not
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.320]   show someone that you're sad.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240]   You might think you're doing that well, but kids are extra perceptive.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.320]   They are actually built to be more perceptive than we are because their survival depends
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   on adults.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.120]   So they have to always notice, "Is my adult around?
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.240]   Is my adult okay?"
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.080]   So they really attune to what's going on for us, right?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.600]   And so I think the kind of question is less, "Do I show my emotions to my kid or not?"
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.980]   And it's more, "Okay, if I'm sad, my kid is going to notice.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.920]   What do I do then?"
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.080]   And as a principal, one of the things I think about often is information doesn't scare kids
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   as much as the absence of information scares kids.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   So let's say there's something really awful.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I don't know.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.960]   As a parent, you're a family member.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   Someone died of cancer.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   I don't know.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.440]   There's something really horrible that you just found out, right?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.520]   There's wildfires.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.360]   Right now, let's say you evacuated and you found out your house burned down.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.160]   You're sad.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.320]   Your child is going to notice that, and you want your child to notice that.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   You don't want your kid to be a teenager, an adult, who goes around the world unable
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.920]   to pick up on emotional cues from other people.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.240]   That's not adaptive.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young inform their view of the world
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   when they're older.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.920]   And so here I am.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.080]   Let's say it's the situation of somebody dying and I'm upset.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   First of all, as a parent, tell yourself, "It's not my kid seeing me sad that's going
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.320]   to destabilize them.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   It's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story or denying it, because then my kid goes,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   'I'm pretty sure my mom was upset.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   Oh, she's not?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.920]   Oh, she's pretending like nothing happened?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.520]   Oh, she looks sad, but she's saying she's not sad.'"
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.200]   That is really upsetting.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.920]   It would be like hearing your boss say, "Oh yeah, 20% layoffs.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   What are we doing?
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920]   I don't know.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   Oh, hi.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   Everything's great.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   How are you?"
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   Like, what is happening?
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   It's scary.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.600]   What you'd want is your boss say, "You just heard something.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240]   You were right to hear that."
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.280]   We are about to go through a really tough time.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   I'm stressed about it.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.120]   I yelled, "You might be stressed.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.040]   Here's what I know.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   This is going to be hard, and we're going to get through it together."
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.380]   Now all of a sudden, that emotional experience has a container.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.120]   It has a story.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.320]   Humans need stories.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.920]   We like stories.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   And so often we think it's the emotions that dysregulate a kid.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.320]   It's the lack of a story to explain it.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.760]   So let's say this really did happen.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.960]   People always say to me, "Okay, but Dr. Becky, my kid is four.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.680]   I'm going to say that their aunt died.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.480]   They don't even know cancer, right?"
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   We don't have a better alternative.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.840]   I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen whose kids have all of these issues because
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   of the made-up stories.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.880]   "I just said she went to sleep for a while six months later.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.200]   My kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night."
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.560]   Yeah, they haven't seen their aunt who went to sleep one time, you know, creates a huge
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   issue.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.720]   No matter what bogus story you make up, kids can handle the truth, and they can handle
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.640]   the truth when it's told to them from a loving, trusted adult.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.440]   It's kind of like me and you.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.160]   Someone can tell us a hard truth, but it's from someone you feel safe with and that you
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.760]   feel like also believes in you and says it honestly.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   It might be hard, but it doesn't feel awful.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.560]   So it's about saying to your kid, "You saw me crying."
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.960]   One of my favorite kind of sentences to say to kids around this, because I think it really
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.120]   builds their confidence, is just, "You were right to notice that I was crying, and I'm
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.200]   feeling sad.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.440]   And look, you saw that?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   I'm going to tell you why."
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.240]   I'm making this up.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.280]   "Aunt Sally died."
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   Do you know what dying means?
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.640]   Dying is when someone's body stops working.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   Then I pause.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.920]   All right, so I'm going to just be a monologue.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.320]   I'll see how my kid responds.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.240]   I might add, "I'm not dying."
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.560]   Kids actually really need to hear that in hard times.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.840]   "I'm not dying.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.040]   No one else is dying.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   I'm safe.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.440]   And you know what?
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.380]   I'm sad.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.320]   And I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you."
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   That sets the stage for such resilience and is kind of the opposite of, "Everything's
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   fine.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.320]   My kid keeps seeing me crying.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.400]   They keep hearing words they're not used to hearing, 'die,' 'cancer,' 'Aunt Sally,'
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.200]   'uncomfortable,' whatever it is."
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   That situation is what makes kids feel really, really uncomfortable and unsafe.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.440]   So it's the absence of information that causes the harm.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   And it's the lack of coherence between what they're observing and feeling and kind of
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.960]   this like open loop, if I kind of place it in neuroscience-y terms, I feel like the brain
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.840]   does think in terms of stories, stories have a beginning, middle, and an end, and they
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.720]   kind of want to know where they are in that story.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.720]   That's exactly right.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.080]   And the terms I would use to match your terms are coherent narrative.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   What is therapy?
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   Why does therapy help people?
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   It's interesting.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.680]   Therapy doesn't change what happened to you.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.000]   Therapy doesn't change your past.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.520]   Therapy does not take away the pain.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.240]   But the pain was never the thing that really got in our way.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.660]   It was the pain plus a lack of a coherent narrative and support.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.640]   And so early on, when kids have painful experiences from witnessing you or something else, giving
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.520]   them a coherent narrative is what they need.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.120]   And without that, the way I think about it is they have what I call "unformulated experience."
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.740]   It's just affect and experience that kind of free floats in their body, unformulated,
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.080]   that tends to later show up as triggers, right, and kind of other things in adulthood.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.680]   And so, yeah, that's what we want to try to avoid when we can.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   [Music]
