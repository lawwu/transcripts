[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   John, in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.960]   John answered them, saying, I baptized with water;
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920]   but there standeth one among you whom ye know not,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880]   and I knew him not.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.360]   But he that sent me to baptize with water,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.440]   the same said unto me,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.040]   Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.200]   the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.800]   And we are considering this statement about the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   And having looked at the doctrine in general,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   we are now considering in particular the question of the spiritual gifts.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   This is an essential part of this whole subject.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.600]   I say that on the basis of the teaching of the New Testament itself
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.880]   and what has emerged in the subsequent history of the Christian Church.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   This is not an easy subject, indeed it's a very difficult one,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.360]   because of its own character.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.160]   We are in a realm where the Spirit is operating in a direct manner.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.520]   It is something, of course, therefore, quite outside the entire realm
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.160]   of the human understanding.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.480]   And we must realize that as we consider it together once more.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.800]   We need a spirit of understanding
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   which the Holy Spirit alone can give to us.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.800]   Now, the great statement with regard to this, of course,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.200]   is that statement in the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.880]   in chapters 12, 13 and 14.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.480]   The Apostle starts by saying,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.560]   Now, with regard to spirituals,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.960]   this whole question of the spiritual gifts,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.600]   and then he proceeds to deal with the subject.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.840]   Now, we've introduced this, we've looked at it in general,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.800]   we've reminded ourselves of the purpose that the Apostle had in mind.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.720]   He writes like this because, in a sense, he had to.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.680]   The Church at Corinth was being divided up in many ways.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   They were dividing themselves up foolishly in terms of men.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.560]   I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   They were dividing themselves up over their understanding.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.800]   The more enlightened brother and the weaker brother,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.280]   therefore, over the question of meats offered to idols.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.200]   They were dividing themselves up,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160]   especially over this question of the spiritual gifts.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   Indeed, they were dividing themselves up
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680]   in terms of their wealth and poverty,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.200]   and that caused trouble at the communion table.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.000]   Now then, all these things were dividing the Church,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.040]   and this question of the spiritual gifts
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.320]   was one of the factors producing this schism,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.520]   this sectarian tendency in the Church,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600]   and that is why the Apostle takes it up.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.400]   Now, we've seen that he emphasises, above everything else,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.960]   the purpose and the object of the gifts,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   which is to glorify the Lord.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.040]   The Spirit himself has been sent to glorify the Lord Jesus,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   not to call attention to himself,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.160]   but always to point to the Lord.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040]   We must ever keep that in the forefront of our minds.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.320]   And then, we've seen that the next thing the Apostle takes up,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.360]   and it is to this, indeed, that he gives most of his attention,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.880]   is the whole question of balance and order.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.160]   And then we glanced at the way in which we seek these gifts.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.800]   He tells us to do so, covet earnestly the best gifts,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.360]   and we saw that there are certain false mechanical,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.960]   psychological ways in which people can attempt to do this,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.160]   and therefore bring themselves into trouble,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.040]   and the whole doctrine concerning gifts ultimately into disrepute.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760]   Now, we must go on with this,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.720]   and we must do what the Apostle does, we must follow him.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.640]   You notice that in these three chapters,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.240]   he gives the greatest prominence to the whole question
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.000]   of what is called speaking in tongues.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.160]   Why does he do that?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.200]   Well, he does that because that was the main cause of trouble in Corinth.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.320]   That was the thing that was causing this confusion.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   That's perfectly clear.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.600]   The object of the three chapters
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.800]   is really to put the question of speaking in tongues into its right place,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.880]   to give the Corinthians a due sense of proportion with respect to it.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.400]   They were putting it in the first place.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.080]   They were talking about it,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.120]   and they were all trying to show that they possessed the gift.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.520]   And thus, the disorder to which he refers
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.680]   had entered into the life of the church.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.520]   Now, there is no doubt whatsoever
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.920]   that this is the main object which the Apostle has in his mind.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.400]   He keeps on repeating it.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   The whole of the 14th chapter is virtually given over to this one thing,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.800]   and it's interesting to notice the way in which he handles it.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   In the lists he gives, he puts speaking in tongues last in the two lists.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.080]   He deliberately does that.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.920]   He puts it last in his lists
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.480]   because the Corinthians were putting it first.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.920]   That's his way of correcting them.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.480]   And then, of course, he goes out of his way,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.280]   and he repeats it several times
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.360]   to show that prophecy is the greater gift,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.240]   and this is the thing they should seek.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   So he deals with tongues by contrasting it with the gift of prophecy.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.320]   And thereby, I say, his whole object is to show
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.000]   that this exaggerated importance
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.320]   which the Corinthians were giving to this speaking in tongues
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.720]   was entirely wrong.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.320]   Now, that is the whole object of this great passage,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.800]   1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.840]   He wants to put the gift of tongues in the right place,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   which was not the place that was being given to it by the Corinthians.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.160]   Now, we are dealing with it, I say,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.320]   because it is our duty to expand the Scriptures.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.640]   If there's anybody listening to me at this moment
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.240]   who says, "I'm not interested in the gift of tongues.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.920]   I'm not interested in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14."
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.880]   Well, all I have got to say to you is this,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.560]   that what I want to discuss with you is not the gift of tongues,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.240]   but your whole view of the Scriptures.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.960]   Anybody who cuts out portions of Scripture
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.520]   is guilty of a very grievous sin.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   It is the business of all of us as Christians
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.000]   to understand the whole of the Bible.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.160]   And unless we are making an effort to do so,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   we are very poor Christians.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   That quite apart from the fact
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.120]   that we are probably quenching the Spirit at the same time
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   and are just desirous of going along
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.360]   in our undisturbed, self-satisfied,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.760]   smug kind of formal Christianity.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.480]   I have nothing to say to that,
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.960]   except to warn such people
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.360]   that they will have to stand before God in the judgment
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.000]   and give an account of themselves
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.960]   and how they've paid attention to the Word
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.760]   that He has provided for them
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.680]   and for their growth and development.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.440]   Very well, that's our main reason for considering it.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.480]   But we have further reasons.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.960]   Here's another.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.680]   This whole question has received a great deal of prominence
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.040]   in this present century.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.760]   A movement broke out in 1907,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.160]   particularly in America, but also partly in this country,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.040]   in connection with speaking in tongues.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   It's become known as Pentecostalism.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   Now, it started then.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.000]   We needn't go into the history.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.880]   But this subject has had a good deal of prominence
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.080]   because of that ever since.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.600]   And it behoves us, therefore, to know something about it.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.960]   But in the last three or four years,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.880]   there has been a revival, again,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.640]   of interest in this,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.080]   starting mainly, again, in America,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.520]   but coming over to this country and other countries.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.320]   And there is, at the present time,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.640]   amongst many good, excellent Christian people,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.120]   a great deal of interest
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.040]   in this whole matter of speaking in tongues.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.120]   It's receiving much prominence.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.400]   And therefore, it is our business to be aware
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.720]   of the teaching of the scripture with respect to it
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   in order that we may know
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.120]   what attitude to adopt with regard to it.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.000]   And thirdly, and lastly,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.880]   my reason for calling attention to it is this,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.720]   that quite obviously, it is of all the spiritual gifts,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.400]   the one that is most likely to be abused.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.360]   That's the whole thrust of this passage in 1 Corinthians.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.200]   Why is that?
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.880]   It may be that it was the one
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   that was distributed most freely.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.320]   It may well be because it is the least of the gifts.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.960]   And it's quite clear that as you look
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.320]   at these lists, you will see that a gift like this
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.720]   is more liable to be misused
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.840]   and to be abused than any of the others.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.680]   And this, of course,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   is something that happens amongst believers.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.360]   That was the trouble in Corinth.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.840]   They all wanted to speak in tongues
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.040]   and they wanted to do so at the same time, many of them.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   It tends to lend itself to a tendency to exhibitionism.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.160]   It tends to promote selfishness.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.360]   Now, this is the wonderful thing about the Christian life.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.720]   We are born again, but we are not made perfect.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.480]   And that is why we are liable to go astray.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.560]   And that is why we are subject to listen
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.200]   to the attacks of the enemy, the adversary of our souls.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.280]   That is why these New Testament letters ever came into being
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.540]   because Christian people were being led astray
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.980]   in these various ways.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.580]   And so I say there is no gift, perhaps,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.320]   that is more liable to be abused.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.360]   None that is more liable to attract
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.460]   the carnal part of our being still,
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.460]   and so lead to excess and to abuse.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.160]   And certainly it is true to say
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.560]   that there is no gift of the spirit
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.440]   that has lent itself so much to the counterfeit
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.720]   of the devil in various forms than this particular gift.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.400]   I think I've already reminded you
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.120]   that it's quite authentic that spiritists
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   can speak in tongues.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.640]   There's no question about this at all.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.720]   There have been endless recorded cases of this.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.040]   Not only that, people under certain psychological states
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.320]   and conditions can be made to do this.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   With regard to the spiritists,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.080]   I was only told of a case some two months ago.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.960]   A certain lay pastor came to me
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.880]   in considerable distress about this
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.840]   over a girl that was clearly, obviously devil-possessed.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.000]   And she was able to speak in tongues, and so on.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.960]   These things are well-established facts.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.640]   Therefore, I say, because of this,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.880]   it behoves us to be unusually careful
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.160]   as we approach this subject.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.200]   So we do so along the lines
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.580]   that I've already been indicating to you.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.000]   We've got to avoid two extremes.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.560]   The one extreme is that which dismisses the whole thing
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.280]   and refuses even to consider it.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.040]   I'm amazed at some things I've read recently.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.920]   Certain Christian people have issued booklets and pamphlets.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.280]   I read one in particular that came from New Zealand
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.320]   in which the writer didn't hesitate to say
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.680]   that all speaking in tongues today is of the devil.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.120]   How a man ventures to make such a statement,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.760]   I simply cannot understand.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.960]   I wouldn't dare to do so.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.160]   No, no, we must be very careful in all we are saying.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.440]   We must be open in this matter.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.280]   The apostle tells us, "Wherefore, brethren,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues."
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.380]   We've already dealt with the argument that says
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.680]   this only belonged to the early church.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.800]   If you once go along that line,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.440]   you'll soon find that the New Testament
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.600]   has practically nothing to say to you at all.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.880]   You'll have to say it was all for the early church.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.080]   But clearly, it wasn't, it is for us.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.360]   Very well, then, we start by saying
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.480]   that it is always possible that the Holy Spirit
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.040]   may give this gift to certain individuals.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.200]   It's always a possibility.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.520]   So when we hear of any reported case,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.440]   we don't dismiss it, we don't condemn it.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.560]   But we must examine it.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.080]   In the sovereignty of the Spirit,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.760]   he can give any one of these gifts at any time.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.400]   We must therefore always be open.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.240]   But for the reasons we've already adduced,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.800]   we must also always be cautious and careful.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.920]   We must prove all things
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.800]   and hold fast only to that which is good.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.120]   Very well, now, what is the teaching in this great passage
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.260]   with regard to this matter, this speaking in tongues?
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.520]   Well, I've tried to put it under certain headings
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.000]   for the sake of convenience.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.840]   Here's the first.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.920]   Tongues, speaking in tongues,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.480]   is not the invariable accompaniment
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.680]   of the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   It is not the invariable accompaniment of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.920]   Now, I put it like that because there's much teaching
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.280]   which has been current for a number of years
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760]   and is current at the present time,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.920]   which says that the speaking in tongues
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   is always the initial evidence
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.800]   of the baptism with the Spirit,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.680]   and which therefore goes on to say
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.880]   that unless you have spoken in tongues,
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.160]   you have not been baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.720]   I am suggesting that that is entirely wrong.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.520]   The apostle asks in 1 Corinthians 12, 30,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.560]   "Have all the gifts of healing?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.920]   "Do all speak with tongues?"
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.720]   Again, in the 14th chapter in verse three, he says,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   that he desires that they all might,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:13.880]   verse five, "I would that he all spake with tongues,
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   "but rather that he prophesied."
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.320]   And when he says that he wishes
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.920]   or would that they all spake in tongues,
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.800]   he's clearly saying that they all didn't.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.720]   Now, it seems to me that this should be sufficient
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.520]   in and of itself.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.680]   But in addition to that, there is other great evidence.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.960]   When we were dealing with the question
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.520]   of the baptism of the Spirit in general,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.720]   I gave you a number of quotations
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.240]   of some of the greatest and most saintly men
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.440]   the church has ever known,
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.440]   some of the greatest preachers and evangelists.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.200]   People like Whitefield and the Wesley brothers
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.000]   and Finney and Moody,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.640]   and countless others whom I could mention.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.960]   Men who received the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   after their conversion in a most unmistakable manner.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.240]   And who gave proof that they had received this
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.080]   by being used so mightily of God in evangelism
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.320]   and in revival.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   But none of them spake with tongues, not one of them.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.200]   Now these are sheer facts,
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.040]   and it surely should indicate to us
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.560]   how wrong it is to make these dogmatic assertions.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.800]   But let me be quite fair.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.400]   All who belong to the Pentecostal church do not teach this.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.080]   Some do and some don't.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.560]   It's very interesting to notice
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.600]   that at the European Pentecostal conference,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.240]   which was held in Stockholm in 1939,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   it was admitted that tongues might occur
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.080]   apart from the Spirit's acting.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.240]   Now these men are men of God, you see,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.160]   and they're honest men,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.960]   and there in conference, in a world conference,
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.880]   they were ready to admit that powers
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.960]   other than the Holy Spirit
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.640]   can enable people to speak in tongues.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.400]   But they then went on to say
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.360]   that a Christian could be filled with the Spirit
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.000]   without the sign of tongues, quite so.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.280]   They would have been flying
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.560]   in the face of the facts of history,
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.640]   as well as in the plain teaching of the scriptures
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.480]   had they not made that admission and concession.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.120]   Why is one concerned about this?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.680]   Well, let me tell you why.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.640]   I'm concerned about it for this reason.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.560]   When people are told that unless they speak in tongues,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.120]   they have not been baptized with the Holy Spirit,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.200]   many people who have been baptized with the Holy Spirit
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.320]   are made to feel very unhappy.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.720]   They say, "But I've never spoken in tongues."
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.400]   Well, they are told you have therefore
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.440]   never been baptized with the Spirit,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   but they thought they were.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.240]   They had every reason for thinking that they were,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.320]   and thus they're made unhappy.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.240]   But still more serious is this.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.840]   Being made unhappy in this way by this false teaching,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.000]   they now, of course, become much more open
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.280]   than they were before to the psychological pressures.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.920]   Leave alone the influence of evil spirits.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.420]   They're so anxious to have this essential evidence
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.440]   that they do everything they can to speak in tongues.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.000]   And of course, some of them after a while
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.680]   begin to speak in tongues.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.080]   But the question is, what has made them do so?
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.760]   Others remain in unhappiness and in misery.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.720]   Which is quite wrong and quite false.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.600]   It's all due to this wrong teaching.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.080]   Very well, I'll leave it at that.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.360]   It is to fly in the face of the scriptures
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.520]   and the history of the church.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.880]   To say that unless a man has spoken in tongues,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.480]   he has never been baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.160]   Let me say again that one of my main objects
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.400]   in this whole series of sermons
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.640]   is to safeguard the doctrine of the baptism
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   There is a tendency on the part of some, as you know,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.960]   because they dislike the gifts and the manifestations
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.520]   and the excesses, to throw out the doctrine
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.720]   of the baptism of the Spirit with it.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120]   I'm here to say that you must differentiate
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.440]   between the two.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.120]   It is possible for a man to be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.840]   without ever speaking in tongues.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.960]   And indeed, without having some of these other gifts
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.360]   that are indicated in the lists of the apostle
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.680]   in this great passage that we are examining.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.360]   Very well, I'll leave that at that.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.280]   Let's come to the second matter.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.200]   What is speaking in tongues?
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.520]   Now this is helpful again to throw light
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.960]   upon the present discussion.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.880]   How do you define speaking in tongues?
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.640]   Now here there is a difficulty
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.200]   that arises because of what we are told
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.680]   in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.160]   Of what happened to the apostles on the day,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.080]   not only the apostles, but those who were gathered
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.640]   with them in that upper room on the day of Pentecost.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   We are told there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.960]   like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.920]   and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.480]   and began to speak with other tongues
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   as the Spirit gave them utterance.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.960]   Now the tendency in some is to identify that
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.080]   with what the apostle is speaking about
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.880]   in this first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.760]   in these chapters.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.640]   And yet it seems to me that that is something
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.920]   which is, again, just sheer confusion.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.760]   Why do I say that?
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.320]   Well, I say it for this reason.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.720]   That in what happened on the day of Pentecost,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.000]   it is perfectly clear that the apostles
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.080]   were speaking in known languages.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.280]   We prove that by pointing out how the different people
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.120]   who were there were astonished at this fact,
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   how it was that they were all hearing these men
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.880]   speaking in their own languages.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.360]   They were all amazed and marveled,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.000]   saying one to another, "Behold, are not all these men
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   "which speak Galileans, and how hear we every man
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.960]   "in our own tongue wherein we were born?"
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.560]   They were clearly speaking in their languages.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.000]   There are some who say that what happened was
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.800]   that the apostles were speaking their normal language
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.000]   of Galileans, but that the gift of understanding them
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.640]   was given to the other people.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.800]   That is wrong for this reason.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.360]   If that were so, it would be the other people
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   on whom the Holy Ghost had descended.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.800]   The miracle would have happened in the listeners.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.920]   But the account tells us that the miracle
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.800]   had taken place in the speakers, in the apostles.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   The apostles were enabled to speak these various languages.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.560]   And the people were able to hear them.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.320]   In other words, there was no need of an interpreter.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.040]   The people knew the languages
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.200]   and they understood what was being said.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.760]   Now that's the great characteristic of Acts 2.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.400]   Languages, known languages, no need of an interpreter
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.120]   because the people understood.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.840]   Now the whole point in 1 Corinthians is
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   that interpretation is an absolute necessity.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.040]   And that without interpretation,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.000]   this thing should not be done.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.520]   You get this emphasis on the need of an interpreter
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   in 1 Corinthians 14, in verses 2, 4, 14, and 15.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.240]   Now, it's clear to me, therefore,
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.000]   that in the Corinthian passage,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.360]   we are not dealing with known languages
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.760]   as we were in the book of the Acts of the apostles.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.560]   There's a very good reason into which I needn't enter.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.800]   Why, what happened on the day of Pentecost did happen.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.240]   It's the answer to the tower of Babel.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.280]   It is the indication of the universality of the gospel.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.840]   But here, we are dealing with something different.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.560]   And it's quite clear that in a cosmopolitan city,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.320]   a seaport like Corinth, there would have been people
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.920]   from different languages and from different parts.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.720]   And it's quite clear that if these Christians
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.480]   were speaking in various languages,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.280]   that there would have been people present
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.200]   who could have understood the apostle Paul himself
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.880]   as a man who could speak several languages clearly.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.240]   But he says that when he spoke in tongues,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.540]   there were times when he didn't understand.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.420]   As there was the gift of tongues,
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.160]   there was the gift of interpretation also.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   Therefore, it seems to me quite clear
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.320]   that in Corinthians, we are not dealing
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.520]   with known languages in any case.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.040]   There seems no point or purpose in a man
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   in private prayer praying in some other language.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.480]   What is there to be gained by that?
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.440]   There doesn't seem to be any object or any purpose in it.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.120]   Well, what is this?
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.640]   Well, here, I want to suggest to you,
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.320]   a lot of the trouble has arisen because people
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.080]   haven't given the full significance to the word tongue.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.520]   In an unknown tongue, or in a tongue,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.760]   the unknown is generally supplied.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.280]   What is the basic meaning of this word tongue?
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.520]   Now, I'm not giving my own opinion here.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.280]   I'm giving what is the opinion
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.360]   of the experts on these matters.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.020]   And there's no doubt that the Greek word
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.040]   means speaking tongue.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.960]   Or if you prefer, the tongue in action.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.760]   It isn't referring to dialects or languages.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   The expression used is a reference to the speaking tongue,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.480]   or the tongue in action.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.960]   And therefore, what the apostle is talking about here
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   is the tongue speaking as it is moved by the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.840]   Normally, when a man speaks, his tongue moves
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.280]   as the result of his understanding
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.600]   and the direction of his will.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.000]   But when a man speaks in a tongue,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.080]   the tongue is in action as the result
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.760]   of the operation of the Spirit.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.400]   All these gifts are gifts of the Spirit.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.240]   And therefore, the very word that is implied
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.000]   puts out this whole notion of languages or dialects,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.440]   and is indicative of the fact that it is speech,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.080]   the tongue in action, the tongue speaking,
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.960]   as the result of the propulsion, if you like,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.080]   or the direction or the control of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.760]   Now, this thing seems to me to be made perfectly clear
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   by the apostle in verses 14 and 15 of the 14th chapter.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.120]   You notice how he puts it.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.480]   He says, "If I pray in an unknown tongue,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:44.880]   "my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.920]   "What is it then?
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.520]   "I will pray with the Spirit,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.440]   "and I will pray with the understanding also.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.920]   "I will sing with the Spirit,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.680]   "and I will sing with the understanding also."
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   You see, the contrast is between praying in the Spirit,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.080]   praying with the understanding.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.840]   In the one case, it is the Spirit, the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.640]   acting upon the man's spirit and moving his tongue.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.680]   In the other, it is the man himself,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.160]   with his understanding, speaking through his tongue.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.560]   The tongue is in operation in both cases,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.560]   but in the one, it is the direct operation
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.160]   of the Spirit through the Spirit.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.280]   In the other, it is the understanding of the man
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.840]   that is operating the Spirit.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.160]   Now, these are crucial verses, of course.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.000]   And those who are familiar with the commentary
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.240]   of Charles Hodge at this point will know
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.040]   how Hodge finds himself in considerable difficulty.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.160]   And the only way in which he can get himself
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.960]   out of the difficulty is to say
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.320]   that what the apostle is actually telling us is this.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   "If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   but I am not giving understanding to other people."
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.720]   But that is not what the apostle says.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.440]   The apostle is talking about his own spirit
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.240]   and about his own understanding,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.720]   not about giving understanding to other people.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   That's precisely what he's not saying.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.200]   And that, therefore, is to do violence to the whole text.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   And there are other commentators
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.880]   who entirely agree with what I'm saying.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.560]   He is referring to something that happens in himself.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.400]   Now, in confirmation of this,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.320]   you get the second verse.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.120]   "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.680]   speaketh not unto men, but unto God.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.400]   For no man understandeth him,
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.880]   howbeit in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries."
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.920]   And he says in verse four,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself."
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.600]   This is the whole mystery with regard to this.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.440]   What is it then?
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.800]   Well, it seems to me that we can only interpret it like this.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.360]   To speak in a tongue means that a man for the time being
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.120]   has been taken up by the Spirit.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.680]   The Spirit has come upon him
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.280]   and has lifted him up into the spiritual realm.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.760]   And he finds himself speaking in a language
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.400]   that he doesn't understand.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.320]   It's an extraordinary language.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.880]   Though he doesn't understand it,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   it is yet edifying to him as verse four says.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.800]   He doesn't understand the words,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   but he knows what he's doing.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.000]   He knows that he is glorifying God.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.440]   That's the real meaning of verse two.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.760]   "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.040]   speaketh not for men, but for God."
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.120]   It's better to translate it for rather than unto.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.640]   He is not helping men as it were.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.960]   He's not doing anything to men.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.120]   He's doing something to God.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   What's he doing to God?
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.600]   Well, he's glorifying God.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.040]   He's worshiping, he's magnifying God.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.360]   He knows he's doing that,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.760]   but he cannot identify the actual words that he's using.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.160]   The whole thing is a mystery.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.880]   But you see, we are dealing with the realm of the Spirit.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.360]   We're in a realm which is miraculous,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.680]   which is supernatural.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.520]   That's the whole object,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.120]   which the apostle has in mind in this whole chapter.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.720]   These are spiritual gifts.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.640]   This isn't a man's natural faculties heightened.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.440]   This is a gift, something new, something which is given.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.080]   And so the apostle says that what happens
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   when a man speaks in tongues
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.760]   is that the Spirit is controlling
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.560]   and bypassing his understanding for the time being.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.120]   Instead of it coming through the understanding to the tongue
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.560]   it goes directly through the man's spirit to the tongue.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.520]   Now, the final proof of what I'm saying, of course,
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.360]   is found when he contrasts it with prophesying.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.880]   Prophesying means this,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.160]   that a man again is enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.080]   but it is his understanding that is enlightened.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.120]   So we read in the third verse,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.880]   "He that prophesieth speaketh unto men
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.120]   for edification and exhortation and comfort."
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.000]   The operations of the Spirit are almost endless.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.520]   The Spirit does enlighten a man's mind and understanding.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.040]   Thank God for this.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.920]   We've all known this.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.240]   Preachers in particular have known this.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.600]   How the understanding can be heightened,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.440]   but a man knows that it's coming through his understanding
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.960]   and the tongue is moved by the understanding
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.360]   enlightened by the Spirit.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.240]   But in speaking in tongues,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.320]   the understanding is not involved.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.960]   It is something that happens directly
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.120]   through a man's spirit moving his tongue,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.960]   the Spirit acting upon the spirit of men moving the tongue.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   Now, I was very interested in turning up
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.880]   this greatest and best of the lexicons,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.240]   Arndt and Gingrich.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.440]   They put it like this.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.880]   They say that beyond any question at all,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.960]   the speaking in tongues referred to in these chapters
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   means broken speech of persons in religious ecstasy.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.480]   Broken speech of persons in religious ecstasy.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.280]   That is precisely what I am trying to say.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.400]   That when a man speaks in tongues,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.720]   he is taken hold of, he is lifted up above himself
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.540]   and he speaks in a language that he doesn't understand.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.840]   I'm very ready to agree with those who say
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.800]   that he's probably speaking in the language of paradise,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.000]   in the language of the glory itself.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.760]   I've always felt that this is similar
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.160]   to what we get in 2 Corinthians 12,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.040]   where the apostle says that he was once 14 years before
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.280]   lifted up into the heavens
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.420]   and he heard things that are unrepeatable.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.160]   I think it's similar.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.040]   This is speculation, I can't prove it to you,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.520]   but it seems to me to be the inevitable exposition here.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.280]   So that this isn't some kind of gibberish,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.240]   it is a man, I say, possessed as it were,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.620]   by the spirit, lifted up into a condition of ecstasy,
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:22.720]   in which he speaks in this language of glory,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.280]   not understanding what he's saying,
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.040]   and yet he knows that it is the language of the glory
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.240]   and that he is glorifying God.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.960]   Very well, but let me add one qualification.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:39.160]   Though I say that the man is in a state of religious ecstasy,
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.740]   it doesn't mean that he's unconscious.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.660]   It doesn't mean that he's lost control of himself,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.240]   as I will demonstrate to you in a moment
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.040]   from verses 27 to 32 of this 14th chapter
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.760]   of 1 Corinthians, very well.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.800]   There then, it seems to me, is the definition
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.080]   of what is meant by speaking in tongues,
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.580]   and you'll see the importance of this in a moment.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.400]   The next principle I come, therefore, to is this,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   that as I understand the teaching of the apostle here,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.680]   speaking in tongues is something
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.840]   that cannot be initiated by us.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:24.160]   Or if you prefer it, a man cannot speak in tongues
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.280]   whenever he likes.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.840]   Now, this is to me, perhaps,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.800]   the most important point of all.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.120]   You will generally find that people who claim today
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.160]   to speak in tongues, you will find that most of them say
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.960]   that they can do it whenever they like.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.860]   You ask them that question.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.800]   You say to them, "Can you speak in tongues
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.640]   "whenever you like?"
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.440]   They say, "Yes, whenever you like."
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.080]   They'll do it there for you immediately.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.000]   I am suggesting that that puts them in a category
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.560]   outside the teaching of 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.960]   And this is the way in which I demonstrate that.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.600]   This is, to me, one of the crucial points
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.540]   in the differentiation of true speaking in tongues
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.080]   from the counterfeit speaking in tongues.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.400]   How do I make this clear?
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.080]   Well, I do it in this way.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.120]   I call attention to what the apostle says
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.680]   in the 18th verse of this 14th chapter of 1 Corinthians,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.680]   where he says, "I thank my God I speak with tongues
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.440]   "more than ye all."
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.840]   Now, that, to me, is the most crucial statement.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.160]   Let's be careful to observe exactly what he does say.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.400]   He does not say, "I speak with more tongues than you all."
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.040]   I say that for this reason,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.240]   that the people who reject the whole of the supernatural
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.520]   and the miraculous in these chapters,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.160]   they say that all the apostle Paul is claiming here
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.860]   is that he knew more foreign languages
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.120]   than the Corinthians did.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.660]   They say the whole thing is speaking in other languages
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.640]   and that the apostle says,
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.400]   "Well, I happen to know more foreign languages
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.440]   "than any of you."
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.600]   Now, I reject that for this reason,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.360]   that it's wrong even grammatically.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:18.240]   What he says is that he speaks more in tongues.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.880]   It's an adverb.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.340]   He means more frequently.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.200]   "I thank my God I speak in tongues more frequently
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.020]   "than do you all."
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.760]   What's the point of this statement?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.320]   If it is true to say that a man can speak in tongues
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.900]   whenever he likes,
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.760]   what's the point of the apostle's statement?
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.120]   If it is true of all who have the gift of speaking in tongues
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.000]   that they can do so whenever they like at will,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.680]   well, what is the point of the apostle saying
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.000]   that he speaks in tongues more frequently than they all do?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   It would simply mean this,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.800]   that he decides to do so more frequently than they do.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.360]   But there's no purpose in saying that.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.840]   And indeed, in the next verse,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.360]   he makes that explanation impossible for this reason.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.520]   He says, "Yet in the church,
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.180]   "I have rather speak five words with my understanding
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.020]   "that by my voice, I might teach others also
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.660]   "than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue."
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.900]   Now, it seems to me there is only one explanation
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.100]   of this statement, and it is this.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.640]   The apostle says, "I think I know more than any of you do
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.580]   "what it is to be taken up by the Spirit."
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.040]   This is not something ordinary.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.320]   This is something remarkable.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   It is glorious.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.480]   It is exceptional.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.440]   He is saying, "The Spirit comes more frequently upon me
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   "than any of you."
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.320]   He says, "You are bursting.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.760]   "You're making me burst.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.840]   "And I am telling you that I know more frequently
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.720]   "than any of you do what it is to have the Spirit
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.840]   "taking hold of me and lifting me up into this realm."
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.560]   It is the only conceivable explanation.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.760]   Indeed, I suggest that verse 30 supports this.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.360]   Where he says, he's talking about the prophets.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.180]   He says, "Let the prophets speak two or three
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.600]   "and let the other judge."
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.880]   Then he goes on, "If anything be revealed
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.400]   "to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.960]   What does that mean?
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.080]   Well, it means this.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.120]   He says, "There's a prophet speaking."
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.400]   Now, he says, "If a message is given to another prophet,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.260]   "let the first stop in order that the second may speak."
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.960]   But you notice what it says?
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.480]   "If a message is given to another prophet."
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.160]   A prophet isn't filled with messages
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.680]   which he can speak whenever he likes.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.440]   Oh, no, the message is given.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.280]   Now, the whole of these gifts are given.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.160]   What applies to tongues applies also to miracles.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.240]   Is there any evidence in the New Testament
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.720]   that a man who has the gift of miracles
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.640]   can work a miracle whenever he likes?
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.840]   Of course there isn't.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.440]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.120]   It's the same with all these gifts.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.160]   The prophet is not always filled with messages
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.400]   which he can turn on or give out whenever he likes.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   No, no, the message comes to him, is given to him.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.120]   So is tongues, so are all these gifts.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.560]   Now, I think that this is the most important matter of all
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.440]   because I am here to suggest that if a man tells me
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.920]   that he can speak in tongues whenever he likes,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.280]   it is probably something psychological and not spiritual.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.440]   These are always controlled by the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.800]   They are given,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.880]   and one doesn't know when it's going to be given.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.360]   Now, let me prove this to you
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.960]   and demonstrate it and illustrate it
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.480]   in the case of miracles.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.840]   Look at the apostles in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.280]   They had the gift of miracles.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.760]   But what is so interesting to observe is this.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.160]   The apostles never made experiments.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.000]   They never tried to heal somebody
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.920]   wondering whether it would happen or not.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.320]   No, no, there were no trials.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.480]   There were no experiments.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.920]   And there were no failures.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.360]   This is most interesting.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.600]   And still more interesting is this.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.840]   The apostles never made an announcement
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.520]   that they would work miracles on such and such a day.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.840]   They never put up a poster saying,
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.240]   "Come on Thursday, there will be miracles performed,"
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.800]   or, "This or that will happen."
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.920]   Never.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.760]   Why not?
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.560]   And there's only one answer.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.240]   They never knew.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.440]   They never knew when it was going to happen.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.160]   What happened was clearly this,
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.760]   that suddenly they were confronted by a situation
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.520]   and the commission was given to take the first instance
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.480]   of this in the third chapter of the book
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.880]   of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.680]   We read that a certain man lame from his mother's womb
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.200]   was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.480]   which is called beautiful,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.520]   to ask alms of them that enter the temple.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.640]   Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.480]   asked an alms, listen,
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:55.280]   and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John's self.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.200]   Now, that's just a clear indication
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.720]   that he was given a commission.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.960]   This isn't an experiment.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.360]   He's not just trying to see what may happen.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.200]   He knew.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.200]   He said, "Look on us."
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.440]   And he gave heed unto them,
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   expecting to receive something of them.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.960]   Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.400]   "but such as I have give I thee.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.560]   "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.960]   "rise up and walk."
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.080]   And he took him by the hand, by the right hand,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.920]   and lifted him up.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.120]   And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.280]   And Peter then, in explaining it,
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.560]   gives the explanation.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.520]   "The God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.400]   "the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jesus.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.520]   "His name, through faith in his name,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.800]   "hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know."
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.440]   In other words, he was clearly given
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.080]   this very definite commission.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.880]   And so what he says happens.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.280]   You can find numerous examples of this taken in Acts 13.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   The miracle that the apostle Paul worked upon that man,
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.920]   Bar-Jesus, who was the servant of the great men
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.680]   on that island of Paphos, Sergius Paulus.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.480]   We are told that Elymas, the sorcerer,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.560]   for so is his name by interpretation,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   withstood them, seeking to turn away
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   the deputy from the faith.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.000]   Then Saul, who is also called Paul,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.840]   filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.480]   This is not a man able to work miracles
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.640]   whenever he wants to.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.680]   No, no.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.760]   He's given a commission.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.960]   He's filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.760]   Set his eyes on him and said, "Oh, full of all subtlety
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.800]   "and mischief, thou child of the devil,
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.440]   "thou enemy of all righteousness,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.040]   "wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.480]   "And lo, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee,
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.400]   "and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season."
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   The apostle Paul couldn't do that sort of thing
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.480]   whenever he wanted to.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.680]   He's given a commission.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   And so what he says happens.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.360]   It's absolutely certain.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.800]   And you get the same thing with his healing
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   of the men at Lystra, as it is to be found recorded
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.160]   in the 14th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.920]   You get the same expression again.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.520]   The same heard Paul speak,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.960]   "Who steadfastly beholding him
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.480]   "and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.960]   "said with a loud voice."
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.200]   Can't you hear the authority?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Can't you hear this note of commission?
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.920]   Of course, this is given.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.320]   It's the Spirit who gives it.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.480]   It isn't a permanent possession in a man.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.800]   And then you've got another striking example
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.520]   in the 16th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.640]   in the case of the girl filled with the Spirit of divination.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.800]   Listen to this.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.240]   "It came to pass as we went to prayer,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.960]   "a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.400]   "which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.320]   "The same followed Paul and us and cried saying,
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.440]   "'These men are the servants of the Most High God
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.720]   "'which show unto us the way of salvation.'"
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.160]   Listen, "And this she did many days."
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.920]   If the apostle permanently had the power of exorcism,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.280]   why didn't he deal with her the first day?
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.360]   He knew it was a spirit of divination.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.240]   He knew that she was devil-possessed.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.440]   I answer, he wasn't given his commission.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.640]   "This did she many days.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.520]   "But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the Spirit,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.120]   "'I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.'"
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.560]   He knew there was no failure.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   There was no experimentation.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.280]   He was given a commission.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.760]   Now, I'm saying all this to establish
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   this fundamental point that what applies to miracles,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.080]   exorcism and all the gifts
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.480]   applies equally to the gift of tongues.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.400]   It is not something, therefore,
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.160]   that a man can do whenever he likes
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.240]   and he can just do it always as it were.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.080]   No, no.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:53.040]   "I thank God that I speak in tongues more than ye all.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.560]   "I know what it is, says the apostle,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.040]   "to be dealt with by the Spirit in this matter
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.560]   "more frequently than any of you."
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.160]   He's not just saying,
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.240]   "I decide to do this more often than all you do."
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.160]   No, that's not his case at all.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.640]   He says it happens to him.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.400]   All of these things are the gifts of the Spirit.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.720]   They happen to us.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.400]   They are given to us.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.040]   And therefore, I say that if we possess some gift
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.800]   which we can handle or use or employ whenever we like,
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.120]   it seems to me to put it out of the category
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.240]   of the spiritual gifts of 1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.320]   But it very definitely does put it into line
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.240]   with what we know about the realm of the psychological.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.600]   Self-hypnotism is something that one can do
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.200]   whenever one likes.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.280]   That's its very characteristic.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.320]   It leaves a man with that kind of control.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.160]   So I would put it like this.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.840]   I know a man, a missionary for years in China,
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.600]   who tells me that on one occasion,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.800]   when alone in his room,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.760]   he was baptized with the Holy Ghost
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.960]   and found himself speaking in tongues.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.280]   He has never done so since.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.880]   Now, this man was often worried about this
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.840]   and had spoken to me about it.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.000]   And when I expounded this 18th verse
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.440]   of 1 Corinthians 14 to him,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.280]   I shall never forget his sense of release and of joy.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.800]   I said, "My dear friend,
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.280]   the fact that you tell me that it's only happened to you once
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.040]   makes me say that it was genuine and authentic.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.000]   If you told me that you could do it whenever you liked,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.240]   I'd be really troubled."
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.760]   No, no, my friends, these things are spiritual gifts.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.000]   They are in the control of the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.800]   not in the control of men.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.520]   They are gifts given to the church.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.880]   He is the Lord.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.320]   He gives to whom he will, he gives when he will.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.880]   Let us therefore be very careful, I say,
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.840]   lest we be deluded by the counterfeit
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.120]   in various shapes and forms.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.040]   Consider again carefully the evidence of 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.760]   Just for me to conclude this,
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.240]   let me indicate to you what I said just now,
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.640]   that though the man who speaks in tongues
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.320]   is in a state of ecstasy, he still is rational.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   He still has not lost self-control.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.120]   I prove that by verses 27 to 32.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.640]   If any men speak in an unknown tongue,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.960]   let it be by two or at the most by three,
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.600]   and that by cause, and let one interpret.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.400]   He couldn't say that
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.080]   unless we are able to control these things.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.600]   But if there be no interpreter,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.360]   let him keep silence in the church,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.520]   and let him speak to himself and to God.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.800]   You see, there is this control.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.720]   Let the prophet speak two or three,
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.040]   and let the other judge.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.280]   If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by,
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.880]   let the first hold his peace.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.520]   For ye may all prophesy one by one,
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.480]   that all may learn and all may be competent.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.280]   Here's the crucial verse 32.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.520]   And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.000]   For God is not the order of confusion,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   but of peace as in all the churches of the saints.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.280]   So this is this marvelous and wonderful thing,
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:19.720]   that the Holy Spirit possesses us when he will,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.600]   lifts us up into this realm,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.440]   and yet we have not become irrational.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.120]   You can't initiate this, but you can control it.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.840]   You can stop it.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.440]   That's the teaching of these chapters.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.360]   It is the movement of the spirit.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.760]   Yes, and he may come upon a number,
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.400]   but the apostle says, "You are still rational,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.680]   and therefore there must be no confusion.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.240]   There must be a limit to the number.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.760]   It must be done in order."
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.360]   And he says, "In the church, speaking generally,
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.840]   in the church, let it be prophecy
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.880]   rather than speaking in tongues.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.120]   Wherefore, brethren, cover to prophesy,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.960]   but don't forbid to speak with tongues."
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.400]   But the teaching seems to be
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.920]   that you should exercise this gift
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.000]   if you have it truly on your own,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.480]   when you're in private prayer.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.240]   The apostle here is contrasting
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.920]   what happens in the church
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.680]   and what happens when you're in private.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.240]   And so he takes, you see, that hypothetical case of his.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.160]   In one of these verses, he says,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.960]   "Imagine what the position will be
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.520]   if you all spoke in tongues at the same time."
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.040]   Take the 23rd verse.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.360]   "If therefore the whole church be come together
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.000]   into one place and all speak with tongues,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.920]   and there come in those that are unlearned,
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.040]   who are unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.360]   Now, that's a hypothetical case.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.840]   He's trying to prove the point.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.840]   He says, "If you don't control,
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.800]   well, imagine the extreme case
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   that you were all speaking in tongues at the same time.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.080]   What effect would it have upon this unbeliever?"
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:59.280]   So there he teaches clearly this extraordinary thing,
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:05.920]   that one is lifted up into a realm even beyond understanding.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.720]   And yet there is perfect self-control.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.160]   You will find in the counterfeit
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.160]   that self-control is often lost.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.080]   You're even encouraged to let yourself go,
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.240]   to abandon even your reason.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.840]   You mustn't do that.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.520]   We are never to put our minds out of action, never.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.680]   If the spirit chooses to do something directly to us
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.600]   above the understanding, well, praise God for it.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.680]   But you must never surrender your understanding,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.440]   never let yourself go.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.440]   That is always to open the gate to false evil spirits,
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.840]   to the psychological, to suggestion,
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.320]   and to various other things.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.360]   This is the glory of the way of the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.160]   above understanding,
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   and yet the understanding can still be used.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.920]   And so the apostle can end the chapter by saying,
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   "Let all things be done decently and in order."
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.840]   The prophet cannot initiate, but he can control.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.320]   The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.160]   Well, may God grant that we may meditate more and more
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.520]   upon this great teaching so that we may be able
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.760]   to discriminate and to differentiate
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.200]   in these days in which we live.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.080]   "Prove all things but a whole fast
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.960]   only to that which is true."
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.800]   Now let us sing our closing hymn,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:42.480]   which is hymn number 438, 438.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.600]   "O thou who camest from above
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.480]   the pure celestial fire to impart,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.960]   kindle a flame of sacred love
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.280]   on the mean altar of my heart."
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.120]   438.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.160]   ("O Thou Who Camest From Above")

[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.380]   - O Lord, keep us from falling.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:28.600]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.880]   and the love of God, and the fellowship
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.500]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit,

[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.480]   Now, throughout the remainder of this hour,
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:44.220]   short and certain, earthly life and pilgrimage,

[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.760]   even as we are known, beyond all gifts,
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.660]   in the perfection eternal, amen.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.200]   - We do hope that you've been helped
