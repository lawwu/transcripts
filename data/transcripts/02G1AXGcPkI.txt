[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Does Jesus condemn the comforts of the middle-class American life?
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.280]   Some biblical texts seem to suggest so, particularly in Luke chapter 6.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.680]   This is one of those really important questions we get all the time and today it comes from
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.920]   a listener named Lee from North Carolina.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.100]   Dear Pastor John and Tony, I'm a long-time listener of the podcast and I want to thank
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.400]   you for giving me 10 minutes of spiritual food during hundreds of morning commutes.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.460]   It has literally changed the course of my days as I drive to work.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.200]   That's incredible, encouraging to hear.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.800]   Thank you, Lee.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.360]   This morning, he goes on to say, "I was reading through the Beatitudes in Luke 6, 24-26, and
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   it struck me like never before."
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.280]   Verse 24, "Woe to you who are rich.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.000]   I am rich by worldly standards.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.480]   My wife and I do not live beyond our means, nor do we spend money frivolously.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.400]   However, we do have good incomes and savings."
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.600]   Verse 25, "Woe to you who are full now.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   I have never been truly hungry in my life apart from voluntary hunger."
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   Verse 26, "Woe to you who laugh now.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   I have a joyful life and try to laugh frequently.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.800]   Can you put into perspective Jesus' woes that are seemingly directed right at my life?"
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.560]   And maybe contrast Luke's account against Matthew's who says, "Poor in spirit, hunger
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.600]   and thirst for righteousness, etc.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.840]   I desire the blessings of Luke 6, 20-22, but I'm not sure how to reconcile all of this
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.080]   with my physical life.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.800]   Matthew seems more directed to my spiritual life."
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.920]   Pastor John, what would you say to Lee?
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.880]   Let me read the text in just a second, and then, in case it's just not obvious, point
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.760]   out what the problem is as we compare Luke's so-called Beatitudes and woes with Matthew's
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   Beatitudes.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.480]   But let me preface it with a method.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.560]   I don't think it's a good method to try to force similar sayings in two different
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.760]   Gospels to mean exactly the same thing, because Jesus spoke similar things in many different
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   settings and meant different things by them—not contradictory things, but different things.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.560]   So my approach—and I think it's wise and honoring to the inspired writers—that we
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.160]   let each Gospel writer report what he knows in a way that makes clear a particular meaning
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.280]   about those, rather than saying, "Well, Luke's has to be what Matthew meant, or
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.880]   Matthew has to be what Luke meant."
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.900]   And I would say, "No, that's not the case.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.480]   They just don't contradict each other, but they might be different, significantly different,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   which they are here."
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.600]   So everybody knows Matthew's "Blessed are the poor in spirit"—that's really
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.840]   familiar—"for theirs is the kingdom of heaven," or "Blessed are those who mourn,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   for they shall be comforted."
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800]   So here's Luke's version—I'll read the whole thing.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.640]   "Jesus lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said, 'Blessed are you who are poor,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360]   for yours is the kingdom of God.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.520]   Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.120]   Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.280]   Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   your name as evil on account of the Son of Man.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.120]   Rejoice in that day and leap for joy."
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.080]   I mean, that just seems over the top, right?
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.000]   "Leap for joy when you're slandered, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720]   so the fathers did to their prophets."
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.280]   You can hear how familiar Matthew is to me.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   I tend to default into Matthew's version.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   Verse 24, "But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.920]   Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   Woe to you when people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets."
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.640]   So this is one of the classic places where Jesus speaks in a sweeping and extreme way
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.440]   and leaves you gasping, wondering if he could possibly mean what he seems to say in such
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.880]   a sweeping and seemingly unqualified way.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.480]   For example, he said, "Blessed are the poor."
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   No qualifications.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.300]   "Blessed are the hungry now."
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   No qualifications.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.640]   "Blessed are the weeping now."
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   No qualifications.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.080]   "Woe to you rich," which is the opposite of poor.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   No qualifications.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.900]   "Woe to those who are full," opposite of hungry.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.900]   No qualifications.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.680]   "Woe to those who laugh."
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.080]   No qualifications.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.920]   What in the world are we to make of this?
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.520]   So here we really wonder, well, are there no qualifications?
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   If there are no qualifications, then the wicked poor and the wicked hungry and the wicked
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   laughing will all be blessed by God.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.760]   And if there are really no qualifications, then there are no godly rich, and everyone
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.720]   with a full stomach or who laughs at a baby's giggle are cursed.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.480]   Now I think our approach should not be first to say, "Well, he just can't mean that.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.080]   I mean, he just can't mean that," and call it exaggeration or literary device or something
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.360]   like that.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.120]   Rather, I think we should look for clues in the context.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.720]   Look very carefully.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.240]   Stare until we see them, which he expects us to find, so that we can know there are
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.520]   qualifications.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.320]   Not all the poor are blessed.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.100]   Not all the weeping are blessed.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.560]   Not all those with a full stomach are cursed.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.240]   Not everyone who laughs is under judgment.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   How do we know that?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   I mean, there you go, laying your predisposition piper on top of the text and won't let it
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.080]   say what it wants to say.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   Well, I hope not.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.440]   Here's the clue.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.880]   Jesus says in verse 22 that when people hate you on account of the Son of Man, you should
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.920]   rejoice on that day and leap for joy.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.360]   Picture yourself leaping for joy.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.880]   What does it sound like out of your mouth?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.420]   There's laughter and shouting.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:12.160]   So Jesus is saying loud and clear that in this age, there is a time and a place and
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.760]   a circumstance for great rejoicing and leaping for joy.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   Not the place that the world expects, but a real time and real place for much joyful
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.480]   leaping and laughing, namely when you are persecuted for the Son of Man.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:41.560]   So when he gets to verse 25 and says, "Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:50.280]   and weep," we know he must mean a kind of laughing that isn't the same kind as the
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.720]   joy and the leaping that he commanded in verse 22.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.120]   He doesn't speak out of both sides of his mouth.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.120]   He's not confused.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.340]   He's not schizophrenic.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:09.360]   When he says, "Leap for joy," and then condemns laughter, we know one of them is
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.560]   different than the other.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.360]   There's a distinction being made.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.040]   That's the clue, at least one, that he wants us to pick up.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.540]   There are others.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:25.040]   And so we should apply the same thing to the poor and the rich.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.540]   Is it all poor, just like is it all laughter?
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.300]   No, it's not all poor, just like it was not all laughter.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:38.740]   All the rich are condemned, just like all laughter is not wrong.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.980]   No, not all the rich.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:48.100]   Each one we pick up on and apply the same clue that we saw with regard to laughter.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.900]   So what's the key that makes some laughter blessed and some woeful?
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:03.020]   And the contextual answer is, are you laughing or leaping on account of the Son of Man?
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:09.940]   Because that's the criterion for the first command for joy, when it is done in response
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.420]   to living according to the Son of Man.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.260]   Is your poverty an expression of your devotion to the Son of Man?
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.300]   Is your hunger an expression of your love and devotion to and following the Son of Man?
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.060]   Are your riches owing to indifference to the teachings of the Son of Man?
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.100]   If so, you're under a woe.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.620]   Is the fullness of your stomach evidence that you are for or against the Son of Man?
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:47.140]   So my answer to Lee's question is this, that Jesus has given us clues in Luke's text to
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:57.180]   keep us from treating these beatitudes and curses in an unqualified way.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:04.700]   Poverty and riches, hunger and fullness, weeping and laughter may be signs of blessedness,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:12.780]   or they may be signs of condemnation, depending on how they relate to our devotion to Jesus.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:21.500]   If we are utterly devoted to Him, no poverty, no hunger or weeping can steal our blessedness.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.120]   I think that's what he means by the blessings.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.540]   If you're my disciple and you are acting in accord with your love for the Son of Man,
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.780]   you may be poor, you may be hungry, you may be weeping, but you are blessed.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:44.260]   And if we are not devoted to Him, not following the Son of Man, no riches, no fullness, no
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.420]   laughter can keep us from condemnation.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.760]   That's very helpful, Pastor John.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Thank you.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   Thank you, Lee, for that question and for listening to episodes on your way to work.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.180]   That is so encouraging to hear from our listeners, isn't it, Pastor John?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.180]   It is.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.300]   I pray this blesses you on your way to work today, Lee.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.300]   Amen.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.980]   Thank you for listening wherever you are, driving errands, commuting to work, doing
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.620]   chores around the house, or walking, running, jogging, doing your gym routine, wherever
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.140]   and whenever you listen to us.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.780]   Thanks for making us a part of your weekly rhythms.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.620]   It truly is an honor that we do not take for granted.

[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:36.780]   Well, did God make me to punish me, and why did he create me in the first place?
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.340]   Huge, massive questions like these arrive every day in our inbox from you.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.060]   And those questions, in fact, are on the table next time.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.340]   Why did God make me, and did he make me just to punish me?
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.900]   Heavy, heavy questions.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.900]   Those are next time.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.900]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.

[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.060]   God bless.
