[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   let's talk about seed oils the dreaded seed oil debate should we fear them or not fear them let's
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.080]   assume somebody is going to maintain calories like they're not adding seed oils as a source
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.240]   of additional calories above what they would normally be taking in but let's say they have
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.120]   the choice they can consume a seed oil like canola oil or soybean oil or they can consume olive oil
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.720]   in place of it and let's just compare like which one is better if either and is there anything
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   inherently bad about seed oils and i want to make sure that we talk about the processing because
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.640]   people will say ah the seed oils aren't bad if they come from a quality source but most of the
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   seed oils are through this high pressure high temperature refinement process and that's the
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   problem so what's the deal with seed oils okay the big picture is that people over vilify seed oils
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.720]   one side over vilify seed oils just like the other side over vilifies let's say your standard you know
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.880]   land animal fats like beef tallow butter lard but when you compare those two like
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.400]   seed oils versus the butter beef tallow lard you compare the evidence base of those two things
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.320]   you can find more dirt as far as adverse health outcomes from the land animal fats compared to the
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.280]   seed oils and and that is the reality of the matter um it's really weird that seed oils are being vilified
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.560]   right now because that's not the scientific consensus uh people who have their nose in the literature
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.880]   are are just kind of scratching their heads at the whole seed oil scare thing and there are some people
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.920]   on the fringe who laser in on their philosophies and ideologies about seed oils but then all you need
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.360]   what you need to do is ask a short set of questions okay and you specified the seed oils in the question
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.680]   which is great i mean that you're you're ahead of like everybody else so what seed oil are we talking about
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.360]   what what kind of dosage are we talking about and um what health outcome are you concerned with
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.160]   and then what trial do you find most compelling that supports your fear of the seed oil and so
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.720]   everybody like nine out of ten people immediately will say ah okay you want to know what seed oil canola
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.800]   oil okay great let's look at the canola oil literature and one of the hardest things to do
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000]   is find dirt on canola oil amidst all of the positive effects
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.200]   in almost every trial of canola oil there is even a meta-analysis comparing directly
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.720]   the effect of canola oil versus olive oil on blood lipid profile and
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.680]   maybe you know unsurprisingly to to some but surprisingly to most canola oil outperforms olive
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.520]   oil for improving blood lipids in the sense of um lowering ldl cholesterol that's surprising to me
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.320]   because i assumed that olive oil can do no wrong you know what i i was i was taken aback by that
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.160]   too i i would have been just fine with seeing there's no damn difference one of these anti-climactic
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:37.200]   results but when you take a look at canola oil's composition it has a kind of an extraordinarily high
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.960]   proportion of omega-3 fatty acids compared to olive oil and compared to the rest of the seed oils for
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.800]   that omega-3 i thought it was high in omega-6 it's it does contain omega-6 and that is the
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:58.400]   predominant um fatty acid in canola but it has a high omega-3 content as well it has a high proportion
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   of omega-3 i don't know the exact proportion of omega-3 but what makes canola kind of special as far
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.440]   as the vegetable oils go is its high omega-3 content wow okay um that's going to surprise a number of
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:21.360]   people including me my sense is that any ill effects to come from seed oils are because of who seed oils
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.920]   hang out with yeah right this is sort of the old uh if you're old enough uh like me to remember i'm 49
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.520]   turning 50 in september so i'm not quite 53 but um we're of the same generation and and there was we
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   grew up without the internet right well there was a discussion around cannabis for instance we've done
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.880]   several episodes about it we didn't paint it as good or bad although i do believe that young people
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.840]   especially young males smoking high thc cannabis can predispose to psychosis i mean there's a bunch
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.800]   of debate around this but back in the day it was if you use cannabis soon you'll be using crack cocaine
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.600]   that was kind of like the argument right over time people realize that cannabis has its own potential
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.560]   benefits and its own potential risks right depending on a number of things it seems that people who consume
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   a lot of seed oils consume them in conjunction with a lot of starches and perhaps with added sugars as
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.320]   well and when you lump those together you end up with a pro-inflammatory often hypercaloric uh set of
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.800]   conditions and people aren't getting enough quality protein and then we know what that picture looks like
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   it looks like the united states of america yeah right or most of the united states of america and so
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.640]   i do think that there's something about who olive oil and grass-fed butter hang out with
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   that has the opposite effect like people go oh this is a really high quality olive oil generally in my
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.640]   mind are the sort of people who are thinking about the quality of the salad ingredients they're thinking
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   about the sourdough bread uh as opposed to maybe a more refined sugar containing bread and the people who
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.000]   talk about grass-fed butter are thinking about the quality of the meat sources and they're not eating other
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.120]   protein sources that are laid in with other you know preservatives so to me i think a lot of this
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   quote-unquote seed oil debate will be resolved when we start pulling apart the individual components
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.200]   they're riding in the wrong vehicle right right and i and i think that um from a cost perspective you
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   know this hadn't occurred to me until i started voicing a little bit of this online in which case
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.400]   you learn a lot uh quickly and what i learned was you know there were a number of people who said yeah
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.520]   i'm hearing all this great stuff about grass-fed butter and olive oil but there are people for whom
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:42.400]   the cost margins are just too high to consume all organic and or olive oil and and you know and you
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.160]   have to listen to that and say okay well you know for people needing to feed an entire family um you know
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   perhaps some of these other fat sources uh are more affordable and therefore what are the real health
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.720]   risks with those so anyway i was a bit of editorializing there but um i have a feeling
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.240]   some of this is going to shake out in the in the in the fine parsing of these different diets i think
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.680]   people oversimplify it what people do with seed oils is what people do with dairy they say dairy
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.800]   as if it's some monolithic thing you know with dairy you've got the hard cheeses you've got butter you've
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.840]   got yogurt you've got milk of varying fat levels you know um you're kind of hard pressed to find
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.200]   negative stuff on yogurt you're you'd be kind of hard pressed actually to find negative stuff on hard
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.280]   cheeses um butter of of all of the you know the range of dairy foods butter is the one that you can
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:43.040]   find the dirt on um similar story with seed oils like try to find some negative stuff on
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:52.240]   flax seed chia seed sesame seed uh you can't i mean yeah if you dig hard enough you can try to find some
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:59.600]   negative stuff on canola it's very tough too um even things like soybean oil and corn oil you can
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.920]   look at the literature and it doesn't paint this sinister picture either and so i think people are
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.640]   missing the forest for the trees in general when they're focused on honestly the cooking oils you
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   shouldn't be drowning or deep frying your stuff on a regular basis anyway so um yeah and and beyond that
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.280]   when you look at the effects of seed oil that are examined in the literature for various outcomes you
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.400]   know everything from the intermediate outcomes like biomarker effects all the way to the in quotes hard
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:44.880]   end points like mortality heart attack you know cardiac events and heart disease so the hard end points as
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:53.760]   well as the intermediate or soft end points they're all superior with the seed oils compared to butter
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:04.160]   um lard beef tallow on the whole so there is a severe misunderstanding and falsely founded
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.720]   scaremongering with respect to seed oils to the point where i just think it's incredibly silly
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.960]   people just have to get a hold of themselves and focus on the overall quality of the diet
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:25.600]   and not really get into these absolute you know death matches over what oils they use to cook their foods
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.960]   i am a huge extra virgin olive oil fan that is my go-to that's what i love i could honestly i could
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.440]   like do shots of the stuff i love it that much delicious yeah and um and i i love sesame oil
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.720]   you know but sesame is a seed oil but sesame oil has been consumed by very healthy populations
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:53.440]   throughout asia for the last 5 000 years um and so i i don't necessarily like canola oil you know like
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.800]   as far as the sort of the stickiness and the oddness about it but i i'll still acknowledge that the literature shows
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.400]   overwhelmingly positive stuff about it in the majority of trials um but i prefer olive oil and and i would
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:15.600]   almost feel more comfortable recommending that if if you like olive oil then that should be your go-to
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.800]   rather than oils that are i guess maybe frankensteined or engineered to a degree and you mentioned the the
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.120]   whole idea of the like how these oils are produced like one of the concerns is hexane use to extract
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.800]   the oils from the seed cakes and stuff like that so they the use of solvents to get these oils out of
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.480]   their native source uh i there's some interesting literature showing higher hexane levels in um olive
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.720]   oil than in i forget it was some some other seed oil whether it was canola or sunflower
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:59.680]   and so but nevertheless the hexane amounts were well below established safe thresholds and so i think
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.240]   i really do think that people are getting sort of lost in the weeds and kind of missing the forest
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   for the trees focusing on the little grains of sand and missing the big boulders
