So while much of this conversation is about the history and future of human civilization, we also discussed the political turmoil of present day Israel, providing a different perspective from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu.

[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:36.160]   the civilians suffer, animals can suffer. You have an army with horses and whatever, and the horses get wounded. The horses suffer. The nation can't suffer. It's just an imagination. It's just a fictional story in our minds. It doesn't feel anything. Similarly, when a bank goes bankrupt or a company goes bankrupt or when a currency loses its value, like Bitcoin is worth now zero, crashed, or the dollar is worth zero, it crashed. The dollar doesn't feel anything.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:30:05.660]  -P.G.It's the people holding the dollar who might be now very miserable. So we have this complex situation when history is largely driven by stories, but stories are not the ultimate reality. The ultimate reality is feelings of humans, of animals, and the tragedy of history is that very often we get it, we get it, and we get it.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:35.160]  ,P.G.The order is wrong. Stories are not bad. Stories are tools. They are good when we use them in order to alleviate suffering. But very often we forget it. We, instead of using the stories for our purposes, we allow the stories to use us for their purposes. And then you start entire wars because of the story. You inflict millions, suffering on millions of people.

[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:52.240]   in certain cases, yes, you need to do it, even though it can cause tremendous suffering, but you need to be very aware of the cost and to be very, very, you have to ask yourself again and again and again, is it worth it? Is it still worth it?
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   And the interesting question there implied in your statements is that suffering is a pretty good component of a Turing test for consciousness.

[00:39:52.360 --> 00:40:22.220]   the kind of ultimate reality. When somebody suffers, that is truth. Now, somebody can suffer because of a fictional story. Like somebody tells people that God said you must go on this crusade and kill these heretics. And this is a completely fictional story. And people believe it and they start a war and they destroy cities and kill people. The people that suffer because of that and even the crusaders themselves that also suffer the consequences of what they do, the suffering is true.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:22.220]   The people that suffer because of that and even the crusaders themselves that also suffer the consequences of what they do, the suffering is true.

[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   even though it is caused by a fictional story. Similarly, when people agree on certain rules, the rules could come out of our imagination. Now, we can be truthful about it and say these rules didn't come from heaven, they came from our imagination. We look at sports, so we have rules for the game of football, soccer, they were invented by people. Nobody, at least,
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.740]   Nobody, at least,
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:52.740]   Nobody, at least,
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.080]   Nobody, at least, very few people claim that the rules of football came down from heaven.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.480]   Yes.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.740]   We invented them.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.080]   And this is truthful.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.380]   There are fictional rules invented by humans and this is true.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.800]   They were invented by humans.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.300]   And when you are honest about it, it enables you to change the rules,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.240]   which is being done in football every now and then.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.740]   It's the same with the fundamental rules of a country.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:22.180]   You can pretend that the rules came down from heaven, dictated by God or whatever,
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.180]   and then you can say, "Oh, I'm not a football player."
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.180]   You can pretend that the rules came down from heaven, dictated by God or whatever, and then you can say, "Oh, I'm not a football player."
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:52.160]  , and then you can say, "Oh, I'm not a football player."
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   You can say, "Oh, I'm not a football player."

[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   The 10th commandment, for instance, supports slavery.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   The 10th commandment, in the 10th commandment, it says that you should not covet your neighbor's house or your neighbor's wife or your neighbor's slaves.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   It's okay to hold slaves according to the 10th commandment.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   It's just bad to covet the slaves of your neighbor.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   Now, there is no 11th commandment which says, "If you don't like some of the previous 10 commandments, this is how you go about amending them."
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   Now, there is no 11th commandment which says, "If you don't like some of the previous 10 commandments, this is how you go about amending them."
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:44.340]   Now, in the US Constitution, you have all these rights and rules, including originally the ability to hold slaves, but the genius of the founding fathers of the United States, they had the humility to understand, maybe we don't understand everything.

We want to be equal citizens of this country. That's it. And the apartheid regime was, no, you can't be equal citizens. Now in Israel, Palestine, it's different.

But, you know, if the Palestinians would adopt the same policy as the black South Africans, if you have the Palestinians coming and saying, "Okay, forget about it. We don't want to destroy Israel. We don't know a Palestinian country. We have a very simple request, very simple demand.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:27.940]   Very simple demand. Give us our full rights. We also want to vote to the Knesset. We also want to get the full protection of the law. That's it. That's our only demand. Israel will be in deep, deep trouble at that moment. But we are not there.

But if to some extent it's the story in people's minds, if you can enable one person to see the story in the mind of another person, and more importantly, if you can have some kind of critical distance from the story in your own mind, then maybe you can change it a little.

It's just like it seems like a lot of stuff like really quickly percolated and it's accelerating. It's still accelerating. I mean, history is just accelerating, you know, for centuries. And the 20th century, you know, you squeezed into it, things that previously took thousands of years. And now only we are squeezing it into decades. And you very well could be one of the last historians, human historians to have ever lived.

[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:04.860]   You very well could be one of the last historians, human historians to have ever lived. Could be. I think, you know, our species, homo sapiens, I don't think we'll be around in a century or two. We could destroy ourselves in a nuclear war through ecological collapse by giving too much power to AI that goes out of our control. But if we survive, we'll probably have so much power that we will change ourselves using various technologies so that our digital technologies are not going to be able to survive.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:11.620]   So that our descendants will no longer be homo sapiens like us.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.860]   They will be more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.300]   They will be more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals.
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:23.780]   So maybe they'll have historians, but it will no longer be human historians or sapiens historians like me.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.820]   So maybe they'll have historians, but it will no longer be human historians or sapiens historians like me.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:30.500]   I think it's an extremely dangerous development and the chances that this will go wrong,
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.060]   that people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade the technology that we have.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:33.060]   That people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade the technology that we have.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:33.060]   That people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade the technology that we have.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:33.060]   That people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade the technology that we have.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:33.060]   That people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade the technology that we have.
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:42:01.260]  , that actually downgrading them, this is a very, very big danger.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:01.260]   that actually downgrading the technology that we have.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:01.260]   that actually downgrading the technology that we have. If you let corporations and armies and ruthless politicians if you let corporations and armies and ruthless politicians change humans using tools like AI and bioengineering, it's very likely that they will try to enhance a few human qualities that they need like intelligence and discipline while neglecting the technology that we have.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.300]   I think that if you let corporations and politicians and politicians change humans using tools like AI and bioengineering that we have.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.020]  , that you will try to enhance a few human qualities that we have.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:13.060]   what are potentially more important human qualities like compassion, like autistic sensitivity, like spirituality.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:32.980]   If you give Putin, for instance, bioengineering and AI and brain computer interfaces, he's likely to want to create a race of super soldiers who are much more intelligent and much stronger and also much more disciplined than the ones that are in the military.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:32.980]   And that's why I think that we should be trying to increase the technology that we have.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:32.980]   And that's why I think that we should be trying to enhance a few human qualities that we have.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:32.980]   And that's why I think that we should be trying to enhance a few human qualities that we have.

[01:42:32.980 --> 01:43:02.940]   a human quality that we have.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:02.940]   And that's why I think that we should be trying to enhance a few human qualities that we have.

Another way that really worries me, for me, is probably more likely is a brave new world kind of thing that sort of removes the flaws of humans. Maybe it removes the diversity in humans and makes us all kind of these dopamine-chasing creatures that just kind of maximize enjoyment in the short term, which kind of seems like a good thing, maybe in the short term.

[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.060]   the the global cabal theory, it has many variations, but basically there is a small group of people, a small cabal, that secretly controls everything that is happening in the world. All the wars, all the revolutions, all the epidemics, all the
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:44.020]   casa men

[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:33.140]  , Because first of all it's simple. You don't understand everything that happens in the world. You just need to understand one thing. The war in Ukraine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 5G technology, COVID-19. It's simple. There is this global cabal. They do all of it. And also it enables you to shift all the responsibility to all the bad things that are happening in the world to this small cabal. It's the Jews, it's the Freemasons, it's not us.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:33.140]  ,,
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:47:03.180]  obedience. And also it creates this fantasy, utopian fantasy. If we only get rid of this small cabal, we solve all the problems of the world, salvation. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the war in Ukraine, the epidemics, poverty, everything is solved just by knocking out this small cabal. So it's simple, it's attractive, and this is why so many people believe it. It's not new. Nazism was exactly this.

Actually, the Jews control both communism, Trotsky, Marx, or Jews, blah, blah, blah, and capitalism, the Rothschilds, the Wall Street, it's all controlled by the Jews. So, the Jews are fooling everybody. But actually, the communists and the capitalists are part of the same global cabal.

[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:35.980]   If we give a eye control of the fear of ideas at this stage, I think it's very, very dangerous because it doesn't understand us.
[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:43.740]   A I at present is mostly digesting the product of human culture.
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:47.340]   Everything we've produced over thousands of years.
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:50.700]   All of these cultural.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:51.300]   Products.

[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:21.300]   digests it and starts producing its own new stuff. But we still haven't figured out ourselves in our bodies, our brains, our minds, our psychology. So an AI based on our flawed understanding of ourselves is a very dangerous thing. I think that we need first of all to keep developing ourselves.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:21.300]   I think that we need first of all to keep developing ourselves.

[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:36.860]   and not stories but I think that the deepest and best qualities of humans are not intelligence and not stories

[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:36.900]  , if you try to understand yourself with words you will never succeed there is a
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:36.900]   experience is not verbal if you try to understand yourself with words you will never succeed there is a
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:36.900]   place where you need the words but the deepest insights they don't come from words and you can't write about it that that's again it goes back to to Wittgenstein to Buddha to so many of these pages before that these are the things we are silent about yeah but eventually you have to projected as a writer you have to do the silent introspection but projected onto a page
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:14:06.920]   yes but you still have to warn people you will never find the deepest truth in a book you will never find it in words you can only find it in I think in direct experience which is nonverbal which is pre-verbal in the silence of your own mind yes somewhere in there yes well let me ask you a silly question then a ridiculously big question you have done a lot of deep thinking

[02:36:38.240 --> 02:37:07.700]   Ð½Ð°Ð·Ð°Ð´. You mentioned that the fear of boredom might be a kind of proxy for the fear of death. So what role does the fear of death play in the human condition? Are you afraid of death? Yes, I think everybody are afraid of death. I mean, all our fears come out of the fear of death, but the fear of death is just so deep and difficult. We can't, usually we can't face it directly. So we cut it into little pieces and we face just little pieces. Oh, I
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:07.700]   I
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:08.080]   lost my
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:08.080]   I
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:19.600]   when
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:48.620]   I think there's a lot of people who are going to be dead. And I realized that I was quite young at the time that if you're dead you can't hear anything because that's the meaning of being dead. And if you're dead you can't think of anything like oh now they're remembering because you're dead that's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization.
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:48.620]   But it's a really difficult realization to keep holding your mind. Like you're dead, you can't think of anything like oh now they're remembering because you're dead that's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization.
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:48.620]   But it's a really difficult realization to keep holding your mind. Like you're dead, you can't think of anything like oh now they're remembering because you're dead that's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization.
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:15.740]   But it's a really difficult realization to keep holding your mind. Like it's the end.
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:17.660]   I lost it over time. I mean for many years it was a very powerful fuel motivation for philosophical for spiritual exploration. And I realized that the fear of death is really a very powerful drive. And over the years especially as I meditated it kind of dissipated. And today sometimes I find myself trying to recapture this teenage fear of death because it was so powerful.
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:47.660]  , and I just can't. I tried to make the same imagination. I don't know. It's something about the teenage years.
[02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:47.660]   Yeah, as a teenager I always thought that the adults there is something wrong with the adults because they don't get it. Like I would ask my parents or teachers about it and they, "Oh yes, you die in the end, that's it." But on the other hand they are so worried about other things. Like there will be a political crisis or an economic problem.
[02:40:47.700 --> 02:41:09.660]  , or a personal problem like with the bank or whatever. They'll be so worried. But then about the fact that they are going to die, we don't care about it.
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:10.700]   That's why you read Camus and others when you're a teenager you really worry about the existential questions. Well this feels like the right time to ask the big question. What's the meaning of this whole thing, Ival? And you're the right person to ask. What's the meaning of life?
[02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:11.700]   That's easy.
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:12.700]   What is it?
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:13.700]   So what life is?
[02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:14.700]   So what life is?
[02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:17.660]   what's the meaning of life?
[02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:17.660]   I don't really?
