[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   I've spent hundreds of hours figuring out the right credit cards to maximize the value I get
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.740]   from every dollar I spend. Whether it's travel, groceries, dining, or really anything. Today I'm
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.300]   sharing exactly what's in my wallet in 2025, reviewing each card as I go and breaking down
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.500]   the frameworks I use to evaluate new cards and decide which ones to keep or cut. I'll also run
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.300]   through every major spending category to identify the best cards for each and see if there are any
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.640]   gaps in my own setup. Whether you're optimizing for points, cashback, perks, or just simplicity,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.260]   this episode will help you build a wallet that actually works for you. I'm Chris Hutchins. If

[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.520]   All right. So I am excited to talk about what's in my wallet this year. We're in 2025, recording this
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.700]   on June 4th. The irony here is I don't actually carry a wallet, right? Well, technically I do.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.800]   I carry this MOFT wallet that attaches to an iPhone. It really only holds two cards and a driver's
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.700]   license. I do have this giant book that has tons and tons of cards in it, like back to back to back
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.520]   to back. So this is where I keep all of my credit cards. I will put a link in the show notes if you
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.460]   have a bunch of cards and need something. It was the best one I've tried of a few things. So what is
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.860]   actually in my wallet is usually the Amex gold card and the bank of America travel rewards card,
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.020]   just a everything card and a, you know, four X on dining and groceries. Mostly because dining seems
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.900]   to be the one category where I need a physical card and then a everything catch all card. If I'm
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940]   traveling and I grab a bunch of things, um, but most of the time I can use Apple pay. So just because I
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.680]   only have two cards on me doesn't mean I don't have every single card I have that I can in my
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.440]   Apple pay account. So as I go through this episode, I want to flag that I'm going to mention a lot of
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.140]   cards. And what I'm going to actually do instead of overwhelm the show notes too much is I'm going
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.700]   to put a link to a blog post version of this episode in the show notes, which will also have
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.720]   all the details of every card category, et cetera. And you can also find all the details, uh, on the
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.460]   website, all the hacks.com. If you want to go find anything links to cards, links to posts, we've
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.100]   written episodes, et cetera. So what I'll do today is I'm going to start by running through all of the
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.480]   cards. I have what we have, whether we should get rid of any, then I'll run through the major categories
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.840]   and talk about my favorites and ruminate a bit on what cards are missing that I might be opening up
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.460]   before the end of the year. And as I go through all of this, when I think of a credit card,
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.940]   I think there's really three reasons that I might want to have a credit card. And one of them is
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.840]   probably the obvious one most people think of. And that's because it earns a lot of points or cash
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.560]   back on categories I spend in. If you spend a lot of money on dining, having a card that rewards you
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   for that dining. If you spend a lot of money on groceries, same thing. Or if you just spend a lot
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.420]   of money that doesn't fall into a specific category, having a card that rewards your everyday
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.160]   spending, whatever category that is, there are a lot of categories where there aren't cards for bonuses.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.640]   So that could be another one. So that's one reason I have a card. Next reason I have a card is that it
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.820]   has perks that you really value. So for example, there are cards that give you access to lounges.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.060]   There are cards that help you accrue elite status with airlines or hotel groups. There are cards that
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.840]   have free night certificates. There are some cards that just have so many benefits and perks that relative
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.700]   to the annual fee, you actually think that the card is a profitable card every single year.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.040]   I know there are a handful of hotel cards that are maybe $95 a year, but give you a free night
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.000]   certificate, maybe some bonus points on anniversary every year. And so you're like, well, having this
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.660]   card is actually profitable to keep. I do think that one of the things that holds a lot of people back
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.400]   is that annual fee. And one of the challenges for people new to the credit card and points a mile
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.960]   space is this idea of a really high annual fee and how to approach it. Because I know a lot of people
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.140]   that hear about the Amex Platinum or the Chase Sapphire Reserve and think, wow, that annual fee
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.540]   is more than $500. How could I ever even consider that card? That's crazy. And I will just flag that
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.880]   for almost every card with a really high annual fee, there are perks, benefits, discounts, credits that
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.740]   when you add them all up pays way more than the annual fee. I think last time I looked, I probably have
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.580]   $3,000 or $4,000 a year of annual fees across all my cards. But for any card that's in the second year
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.320]   of that card, and I'll get to that in the next point, I can simply go in and say, how much are these cards
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   worth to me? And if I'm getting an Indeed credit that I never use, it doesn't matter if that's a $400
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.140]   credit. To me, its value is zero. But if I'm getting a $10 a month Uber credit, and I spend more than $10
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.660]   on Uber every month, no matter what, then that really could be valued at $10. Now you could make
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.220]   an argument that maybe because normally I'd get three or four X points that you could value it at
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.080]   95%. So instead of $10, it's worth 950, but it's pretty close to face value. So that's something I
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   think about. So if I look at a card that has a $550 annual fee, but you get a $300 rebate on any
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   purchases and travel, I view that $300 rebate as direct cash. So if it was a $550 annual fee,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   I'd view it as $250 just from that one credit. And as you go through different credits, you can
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.200]   figure that out. I'd encourage you to take a look at the premium card worksheet that the frequent
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.960]   miler produces. I'll put a link in the show notes. They go through for a lot of the major high fee
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.320]   cards, all the different perks, and you can go in and put your value of those perks and decide whether
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.080]   that card is worth it for you. So get a card because the bonuses you get match your spending,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.020]   get a card because the perks are things you really value and maybe couldn't get otherwise. Or the third
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.140]   one is get a card because the welcome bonus or the welcome offer you get from opening up a card
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.440]   really makes that card worth it for you, at least in that year. Now, I love welcome bonuses. I think
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:59.420]   that anything over about 75,000 points is probably something interesting. There are so many offers worth
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.340]   that much or more. So I tend to be a little picky and I get really excited when I see the 100,000,
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.780]   120,000 point offer or five free hotel night certificates offer. Anything like that's exciting.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.240]   Sometimes there's business cards with two, 300,000 point welcome offers, and those are really exciting.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.260]   And so that's something I think about all the time when I'm looking at why would I have a card?
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.600]   It's either going to improve my value proposition every year, it's going to give me perks I didn't
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.960]   have access to, or the welcome bonus is going to be really, really rewarding. And when it comes to
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   those welcome bonuses, you know, you don't get them in the second year of the card. And sometimes those
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.240]   cards have high annual fees. So every time I'm looking at a card after the first year, I go through
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.220]   this kind of review process of, well, am I still valuing the perks enough to keep it? Am I still getting
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.240]   enough value from the spending to keep it? And if it really was, that welcome bonus was amazing,
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.720]   but there's no real ongoing value for the card, I'll go through a mental checklist because usually
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.060]   that card will have an annual fee. And so I'll say, okay, if it's not valuable to me, can I downgrade
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.700]   it to another card? And a lot of issuers will let you product change your card from one with a high
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.620]   annual fee to one with a really low annual fee, or no annual fee, or a card that's more valuable to
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.860]   you. I know within the city ecosystem, the custom cash card is one that people often would downgrade
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.280]   other cards they didn't want to, because it gave 5x points on up to $500 a month in categories that
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.260]   you chose. So that could be a really interesting card. So that's one option. Let's say that's not
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.740]   an option. Let's say there is no downgrade path for the card you have, then you could ask, is there any
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.780]   retention offer? You know, if you reach out to the issuer and say, hey, I have this card, I don't think
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.220]   the ongoing value is going to be worth keeping it given the annual fee. Is there anything you guys could
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.220]   do? Sometimes they'll say, oh, well, why don't we waive it this year? Or why don't we give you
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.280]   30,000 points if you can spend $1,000 on the card, like a little mini welcome bonus. So that's an
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.620]   option. And then if neither of those things are possible, if downgrading the card doesn't make
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:03.200]   sense, if you know, getting a retention offer doesn't make sense, then it's not a terrible idea
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.620]   to cancel the card. But what I would say before you cancel the card is if the credit limit on that card
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.420]   is valuable to you, you could shift it to other cards from that issuer. There's a process sometimes
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.000]   online, sometimes on the phone where you can say, hey, I've got these two cards, each has a $10,000
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.920]   limit. Could we make one of them 18,000 and then leave the other at 2000? And they say, great, we did
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.260]   that. Great. Now can I close the one with the $2,000 limit? So that is something you can do before you
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.680]   cancel the card. I would just wait till after one full year to cancel the card, because there are some
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.560]   issuers that look down upon opening up a card, getting the welcome bonus and canceling it before
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   the end of the year. Now, once that annual fee does post, you can still cancel the card, usually within
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.720]   30 days of the statement closing with the annual fee on it and get that annual fee refunded. So that's
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.820]   how I think about canceling it. Let me talk a little bit about my goals for cards this year. So I am always
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.040]   looking to maximize the earnings I get from all my everyday spending, all the category spending I have,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.820]   but I'm not just going to get a card because it earns more points on something I could spend on.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:15.480]   Let's say I spend $500 a year on entertainment. And right now I would be putting it on a 2X points
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.020]   card. And now there's a card that offers 3X points on entertainment. I'm just going to get an extra 500
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.800]   points a year from that deal because I could have otherwise gotten the 2X. So getting 500 points,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:32.400]   which might be valued no more than $5 to $10 is not worth me opening up a new card.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.240]   So I really want to see that the value I'm going to get from a new card is probably going to exceed
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.120]   at least $200 a year is probably the floor before I'm interested in opening it. And that floor is
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:52.060]   likely higher because the average welcome bonus is probably worth somewhere around $750 to $1,000 or
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:58.820]   more. So if a card's only going to give me $200 of value, I would be better off opening up a new card,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.380]   which by the way would give me $1,000 of value. So it's almost worth five years of
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.600]   that card. And that's kind of how I think about it. The earnings on a new card have to outweigh the
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.680]   opportunity cost of getting a new card with a welcome bonus. Now it could be a mix. That card
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.000]   could have a smaller welcome bonus plus a value every year, maybe plus a few extra perks, and then it's
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.540]   worth it. So that's one. Another goal for the year is I really love transferable points. This is not
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.720]   going to be an episode where we go deep on transferable points. We've done episodes in the
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.580]   past on redeeming your points for maximum value. In a couple weeks, I'm going to talk about some of the
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.120]   tricks you can use to book award travel. And then we're going to do an episode breaking down all the
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.780]   best transfer partners. But at the end of the day, I find the transferring points from your credit card
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:51.380]   to airlines and hotel groups is definitely the way I get the most value out of points. And so one of my
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.100]   goals this year, when I look at all my cards is I want to keep a pool of points in all of the
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.060]   transferable currencies I have, which includes Capital One, Amex, Built, Chase, and now Citi,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.740]   which is new for me this year. So that's a goal. Next goal is I want some more welcome bonuses this
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:14.020]   year. I'm at $324, my wife's at $224, which is kind of a measurement in the industry for those not
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.340]   familiar. Chase tends to not approve anyone for new cards if they've had five cards opened in the last
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.360]   24 months, at least five cards that show up on your credit report. So a business card might not count.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.460]   And so we're below that threshold, which means we could open new Chase cards, we could open new cards
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.040]   from almost any issuer. And so that's something I'm thinking about. I also want to keep maintaining
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:40.080]   lounge access. We travel with kids all the time now. And kids are always hungry, we get to the
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.800]   airport earlier. So it's nice to have a quieter place to go to get some food and just have a place
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.040]   to relax. And a couple of these lounges actually have little kids play areas, which is makes them
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.720]   even better. So definitely want to maintain that. Another goal this year that's a little new from last
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.260]   year is that when cashback is more efficient than points, I'm willing to do that. It would have been
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.780]   crazy when I recorded the 2024 version of this episode almost 18 months ago to think about getting
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.860]   cashback. For some reason, I was just so wired to focus on points. But I think my mindset is that if
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.180]   I'm getting points instead of cashback, then I'm effectively just buying those points at whatever the
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.020]   rate is based on what cashback I would have gotten. So for example, if I'm spending money on just
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.400]   something that gets no bonus on any card, obviously, I could be using my Venture X card,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.900]   get 2x points on everything. But I also have a Bank of America card with Platinum Honors, which is
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.360]   their program that elevates all of their rewards based on how many dollars you have on deposit at
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.740]   Bank of America, which brings up their unlimited cash and their travel rewards and their premium
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:51.380]   rewards cards all the way up to 2.625% cashback. And if you want to go deeper on that, I'll link to an
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:13:00.180]   episode in the show notes on the best cashback cards. But comparing 2.625% to 2x points means
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:07.160]   that I'm effectively buying points at around 1.3 cents each. Now, on top of that, within the Bank of
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.340]   America program, if you have the premium rewards elite card, those points or the cashback you earn
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.760]   can actually be used to book flights for 25% more value. So if you're using them in that way,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.360]   it's effectively about a 3.28% cashback card, which means that using the Venture X card over the Bank
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.580]   of America card is effectively buying points at a little more than 1.6 cents each. Now, I have
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:38.520]   definitely been able to use Capital One, Amex, Chase points to get way more than 1.6 cents of value
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.360]   plenty and plenty of times. However, I'm sitting on a stash of a million Capital One points right now.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.320]   So I'm not sure that at this point in time, I would be a buyer of more points at that value.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.740]   If I knew that I was low on points, if I wanted to build up that stash, if I had a really big trip
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.500]   in mind and I didn't have enough points, absolutely. I think 1.6 cents is even a fair price to pay because
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.940]   sometimes we get 2, 3, 4, 5 cents a point. However, right now in my current situation,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.580]   looking at Capital One points, I'm not sure that trade-off makes sense. Not to mention,
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:21.120]   I also still have the US Bank Altitude Reserve card, which gets 4.5% on Apple Pay, which isn't
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.380]   necessarily capable of being used for every purchase, but a lot of those purchases for an everything else
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.120]   card, home improvement store, a lot of places online, I can use Apple Pay and get 4.5 cents.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:40.300]   And at 4.5 cents versus 2x points, it's as if I'm buying points for 2.25 cents, which I just don't
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.880]   think makes sense. Sure, I could get more value. Sure, if I needed to close the gap to get to a
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.440]   threshold of points that I could use for a trip I wanted, it would make sense. But because I already
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.140]   have enough points, I'm not sure it does. And so that's something that I think about when I'm
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.020]   trying to decide which new cards to get. It's not just which one gives me the most points,
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.540]   it's which one gives me the most return. And when I think of return, I'm thinking of the value of
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:09.000]   points somewhere around one and a half cents in my mind. Certain points I'd say are slightly more
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.120]   valuable. With Chase, I found that I've been able to get so much value out of Hyatt recently that I
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.460]   put those points a little more valuable than other ones. With Citibank, I find that we only have about
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:25.500]   100,000 points right now. So I'm actually more willing to get Citi points than I would other programs
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:31.960]   because there are a couple of interesting uses with Leading Hotels and Preferred Hotels and
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.840]   Eva Air that I just couldn't do unless I have more points. So I'm actually willing to pay a little more
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.800]   premium for Citi points right now just because I have so few of them. Okay, so those are my goals this
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.940]   year. Let's review the cards I have. And before I review them, one of the things that I would encourage
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:53.420]   everyone to do if you go through this process yourself is first, go find some way to categorize
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.780]   where you spend money. Now, if you only have a couple credit cards, most issuers have like an
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:04.180]   annual summary. So you could go pull up the end of year 2024 summary, and it usually breaks down your
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.040]   spending by category. For us, we have so many cards across so many issuers that compiling all that data
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.740]   together would take a lot of work. And I know for some of them, it's a PDF. Obviously, I could probably
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.440]   just throw all those into ChatGPT and ask a question, which now that I'm thinking about that process
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:24.080]   might have been easier. But we also use a app called Copilot to do all of our budgeting. I'm a
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.500]   huge fan of it. And that makes it really easy for us to go and say, where do we spend all our money
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.100]   because we categorize all our transactions. So I can go in and say, how much did we spend on dining?
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.200]   How much did we spend on these various categories? So whatever tool you use to track your spending,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.420]   or the end of year summaries from your bank, I think both of those are valid options. But realistically,
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.520]   even if it's just an estimate, even if you just think, okay, how much do we generally spend in the
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:54.940]   major categories you can earn bonuses on dining, groceries, travel, maybe specifically broken out
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:01.460]   to hotels and flights, entertainment, cell phone bills, or other bills like that. For me, those are
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.280]   things that I'm thinking about. And even if you just ballpark it, it might be fine. Then I'm going to go
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.000]   through all the cards and see how much value I get from that card. And so there's a tool I built to help me
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.460]   with this. It's a spreadsheet that kind of goes through and looks at all the different earnings
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.920]   possibilities for every single card, lets you put in how you spend your money, and then check different
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.240]   cards to see if adding that card to the mix will increase your average return, both in a relative
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:36.380]   sense, meaning you go from 2.6 to 2.5% back on everything or 2.5 to 2.8 X points. So it does that,
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.960]   but it also will tell you your total dollar return based on how you value points and a lot of other
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.880]   stuff. So if you want to check that out, it's at allthehacks.com slash card tool. I actually took a
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.620]   bunch of time to go update it with new cards that have come out recently, some of the changes in old
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.300]   cards. So hopefully that's really valuable to you. If there's a card missing, you're welcome to add it
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.720]   yourself. The instructions show you how to do that as well. So here's how I think about a value of a card.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.200]   It's really just like I described earlier, the amount of spending allocated to it compared to the
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.760]   opportunity cost. So if you spend $500 a month on dining and you have a 3X dining card from Chase
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.800]   and you want to think about going to the Amex gold card, you're going to get one extra point per dollar,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:25.380]   which is on $500 a month or $6,000 a year, 6,000 more points. Let's say you value points at one and a
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.600]   half cents. If you don't, you shouldn't be getting any of these points cards. That's only an extra $90.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.300]   And the card has a $325 annual fee. Even if you subtract whatever those perks and credits are for
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.460]   you, I imagine that breakeven is not going to be very compelling. But if you spent $3,000 a month on
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:49.780]   dining or $5,000 a month on dining, now we're talking about 30 to 60,000 points a year, which could be
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.180]   hundreds and hundreds of dollars. And I think now that becomes really interesting. We also didn't talk
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.520]   about the fact that it gets 4X groceries and all that kind of stuff. So that's the framework I use. I
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.780]   wouldn't just think of it as well, what are 4X points worth a year on this category if you already have a
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:11.900]   card earning three of them. This episode is brought to you by Trust and Will. It is so easy to overcomplicate
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:17.980]   simple tasks. Believe me, I know I love doing so much research. But some things don't always need to be so
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.860]   overcomplicated, they end up getting put off forever, like creating a will or trust. So check out Trust and Will
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.520]   Will because they make estate planning straightforward and so simple you can do it from your couch.

[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   up our estate plan years ago, long before they were a sponsor, because it was quick, easy, and way less
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.140]   intimidating than it seems. In a few guided steps, we had a solid plan in place to protect our family,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.860]   and we were able to customize it to match all our nuanced preferences about what happens to our
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.980]   savings, who's going to be the guardian for our kids, and so much more. I can't tell you how much
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.440]   peace of mind we have knowing that we got all of this taken care of and it was so easy to update online
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:11.900]   after we had our second child. So let Trust and Will uncomplicate the process for you. Protect what matters

[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.900]   points on your rent payments today. So let's run through. First, I'm going to start with Chase.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.300]   And I'm going to try to keep this process pretty quick because I want to get to the meat of this episode,
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.540]   which is me running through the major categories of spending thinking about what the best cards
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.700]   are in those categories. So you got a Chase Sapphire Reserve. I definitely want to keep
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.940]   that because it makes my Chase points more valuable because it unlocks so many transfer partners. It
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.100]   unlocks one and a half points in the portal and you get 3x on travel and dining and we have a huge limit
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.700]   on it. So that's a great card. The lounge access we use. I've had it for a really long time and I'm
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.820]   always curious what perks might be added to it. And it's kind of the marquee card of that brand.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.860]   Chase Amazon Prime card. We used to use it for 5% off, but recently we've been buying a lot of gift
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.700]   cards at around 5% off, if not more. So the primary use case for it is anytime we're buying something
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.100]   where we want purchase protection and still want 5% off because if you use your gift cards,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.020]   you wouldn't get that. It has no annual fee, so we'll probably just hold on to it in case the gift
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:18.140]   card market changes wildly. But if we lost it tomorrow for some reason, it wouldn't be a huge pain
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:23.260]   point. Hyatt business card. Love this card. We've been traveling and staying at Hyatt's a ton.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.660]   Have really valued being a globalist and this card is probably the only way I would have closed the gap
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.860]   to get there. They've got a bunch of cool perks that come with the card like points rebates and
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.860]   credits for staying at Hyatt. Definitely a keeper. Next is the Southwest business card.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.860]   This year we actually got a lot closer to Companion Pass than I thought, thanks to some Chase referrals
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:48.620]   posting. And so having this card was an excellent way for us to close the gap to get to Companion Pass.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.660]   If anyone's not familiar, I'll link to a post about Companion Pass, but it's a level of status that
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.700]   Southwest gives you a person you can nominate to fly free and you just pay taxes and fees for the
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.220]   year you earn it and the following year. And so great card because the welcome bonus on these cards,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:10.220]   all Southwest cards count towards that status. Next is the Chase Freedom Flex. You get 5x on these
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:16.300]   rotating categories every quarter. And I'd say two or three quarters a year, a category pops up that we
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.180]   actually spend enough on that we can hit that 5x. So love keeping this card. On the flip side, we have
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.500]   a Freedom Unlimited card which earns 1.5x on everything and we almost never use it if ever. Maybe we use it
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   at drugstores where I think it gets 3x points or 3% back. So that card probably should be product
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.540]   change to another Freedom Flex so we can get 5x on another $1,500 in those quarters that matter.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.460]   My wife has a United card. It's her oldest card. We don't use it for anything, but it's helping her
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.140]   average length of history on her credit report. So we'll probably hang on to that. And then on the
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.460]   business side, we've got a Chase Inc. Preferred, which is good for travel if you want to segregate
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.420]   personal and business expenses, but also it gets 3x on some bill payment platforms that we use for the
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.780]   business. We also have the Chase Inc. Cash Card which gets 5x on phone and office supply,
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:08.380]   which we don't nearly spend enough on to make it worth holding on to this card, but it's no annual
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.260]   fee. It doesn't really affect us. We wouldn't get a lot of benefit from canceling it or keeping it.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.580]   So as long as we're getting some elevated points on phone and office supply, why not keep it even if we
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   don't spend a lot in those categories? All right, Amex. Gold card, 4x on dining and grocery. We spend a ton
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.780]   in those categories. Absolutely keeping the card. We can make pretty good use out of the credits such that
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.700]   it's definitely a positive ROI. We do have two platinum cards. I think we probably opened the
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.540]   second one for a large welcome bonus, but kept it because they removed guest access for the Centurion
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.980]   Lounge and we wanted to have the ability to be able to go as a family or at least Amy and I go and get in.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.820]   Now that our children are old enough, they either need their own card, which they're not old enough
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:54.380]   for, or you have to spend $75,000 on an Amex platinum card in order to get guest access.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.340]   We actually did that this year on one of the business cards. And so it's not necessary to
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.460]   keep both of these TBD on whether we cancel one or not. We've been pretty good at getting value out of
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.740]   the perks. So we'll see what that looks like. Maybe what a retention offer looks like and make a call.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:16.620]   Next is the Bonvoy Brilliant card. I am two years away, or I guess one year after this one from lifetime
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:23.260]   platinum on Marriott. So it made sense to upgrade to this card. It has a higher annual fee, but it gets me
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.620]   platinum for the year, which counts towards the last two years I need to hit lifetime platinum.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.580]   So definitely keeping this card at least through next year. On the Hilton side, we have two Hilton
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.220]   Aspire cards that we will keep as long as they keep delivering an annual free night certificate,
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.740]   because we've been able to get tremendous value from these free night certificates,
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.300]   especially when you layer on the fact that the card comes with free diamond status on Hilton,
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.140]   which is their top tier of status. And we've been able to get free nights at the Caprocot in
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.700]   Mallorca, which was running at about $3,000 a night. We just used some free nights at the
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.420]   Waldorf Astoria that just opened in Costa Rica, which is running over $1,000 a night. So we get
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.620]   a ton of value from these free night certificates. Next is the Delta Business Platinum card. This is
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:12.700]   one that had a huge, I think it was 100 or 110,000 point signup bonus this year. Opened it not just for
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.460]   the signup bonus, but because we get free check bags on Delta, which we usually fly about once or twice a
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:24.620]   year, you get a free companion certificate, and you get 15% off anytime you're using your miles to book
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:31.260]   flights. So it pays dividends this year and years to come anytime you're trying to use your Delta miles.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.500]   So if you figure we have a few hundred thousand Delta points, or at least I do in my account,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.940]   because the benefit only applies to the account of the primary cardholder that makes all of my Delta
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.380]   miles more valuable. Also on the business side, we've got a couple of business Platinums and a couple
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.180]   business golds. And we probably don't need all of these though. We've gotten a few mailers in the
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.300]   mail offering some really great welcome bonuses, which led me and Amy to sign up for each of them.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.180]   So not sure what we'll do with the business Platinums. They do have some changes to the perks.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.820]   And I expect that as the Dell perks have gotten devalued, maybe in the second half of the year,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.780]   we'll see something new, which will help us decide whether they actually make sense to hang on to.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.740]   On the business gold side, the Forex points in a bunch of different categories,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.140]   you get it in the top two categories you spend in. We've actually been able to get some decent value
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:25.980]   from that. So as long as we're able to get enough value to cover the annual fee, we'll probably keep
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.580]   them. If not, we'll drop them.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:33.020]   Last two, we don't actually use that much. One is the Bonvoy business card, got it a long time ago because
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.820]   I was pretty excited about Marriott. We were trying to stay there more and more. And this
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:44.460]   helped give us 15 extra elite nights towards status each year. But this year we're not staying nearly
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.700]   enough that we're even going to get to any number of elite nights that give us status. And we're
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.100]   actually relying on the Bonvoy brilliant card to just get that status as one of the benefits.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.060]   So I think you could view this card as we pay an annual fee to get a free night certificate,
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.820]   but I think it's capped at 35,000 points and we haven't had a ton of great use for those one-off
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:08.140]   low value certificates. If we are able to use it, then we probably get more than the annual fee of
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.180]   value. So it's probably a wash, but it's not a card that, you know, I'm not excited to be using that
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.740]   often. And then last, I have an Amex blue card that I've held for 20 plus years. I think it's my
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.060]   oldest card that I still have open. So I'll probably keep putting a couple of charges on that card
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.820]   every year just to make sure it stays open. Capital one, we opened two Venture X cards when
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.820]   they had a hundred thousand point welcome offer when they launched it have been using them a ton
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.020]   for two X points. I talked earlier about why we've moved some of that to cash back.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.940]   Definitely. We'll keep one of these around, but probably don't need two of them, especially
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.180]   because capital one makes it really easy to move their miles from one card member to the other,
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   even if you don't live in the same household.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.540]   Also have a spark cash plus card that I opened on the business side, had a really big welcome offer,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.580]   and we actually put a ton of spend on it even beyond the welcome offer just to get 2% back on
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.700]   everything. But as things have changed, I feel like there's more lucrative ways to earn points,
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:08.140]   miles and cash back than just 2%. So this is one where I haven't really been using it much at all,
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.380]   and probably just time for us to part ways. New addition this year is Bank of America,
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:18.060]   we've actually have four new cards, and three of them are all tied to their cashback platinum honor
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:25.020]   status. And so for those not familiar, if you're able to deposit $100,000 in a Bank of America account,
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.340]   or a Merrill Lynch account, it can be a self-directed brokerage account. So you can just move over some
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.380]   stocks, you can move over an old Roth IRA or anything like that. They multiply the earnings of
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:40.940]   the card by 1.75. They have tiers below that as well, that if you can only put $25,000 or $50,000,
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.580]   you'll still get rewarded, but not as much if you can meet the $100,000 requirement.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:51.340]   And so the premium rewards elite card is the consumer version that we have. And because of
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:57.420]   that platinum honor status, and because we use the points that we earn from that card for a 25%
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:05.740]   boost to book travel, that card is effectively a 3.28% card on everything we spend, and then a 4.4%
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:11.660]   card on travel and dining. Now it's marketed as a 1.5x on everything, 2x on travel and dining. But when you
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.660]   multiply each of those by 1.75 for the platinum honor status, and then you multiply them by 1.25,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.860]   because we can use the points we earn to book flights for a boosted value, that's where I get
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.660]   to those numbers. So that's a nice cashback everyday driver for a lot of the spend we do.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:33.740]   On the business side, we've got the travel rewards card, which is the same thing on the everything
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.380]   spend, but doesn't have any boost for travel and dining. But you can transfer those business travel
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:43.580]   rewards points over to the premium rewards elite and use them for booking travel as well. And then
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:50.780]   we've got the customized cash business card, which is, I think it's 3x base earning on up to $50,000 a
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.900]   year in the category of your choice, of which there's a couple categories we spend that much
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:02.140]   or more on. And then when you multiply by platinum honors, you get up to 5.25% back for a no annual
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.500]   fee card, definitely pays for itself every year. And then we opened an Alaska business card this year,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.700]   primarily because we've been flying Alaska a lot more, and I was gonna go for Alaska status. And so
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.260]   this card helps that. Also, you get an annual companion certificate, free check bags, and they
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.580]   had a 75,000 point welcome offer, which was interesting. But I'll talk a little bit in a
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:26.140]   few minutes with Citi about why maybe I'm not going for Alaska status, even though we're flying Alaska.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.020]   We also opened two US bank altitude reserves when there was a rumor that the card was getting shut
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.380]   down. Since you can't have this card anymore, I won't talk about it too much. They might in the future
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:43.740]   let you product change other cards to it. But effectively, it is a 3x card or a 3% cashback card
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:49.340]   on mobile pay like Apple pay and travel because they have this real time rewards program where
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.860]   if you make a travel purchase, you can pay that travel purchase off with your rewards at a rate
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:02.300]   of 1 point to 1.5 cents. It's actually effectively a 4.5% cashback card on mobile wallet and travel,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.860]   which is pretty compelling, doesn't even require you to book flights in their portal or anything
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.100]   like that. It's really a great card for us for mobile wallet spend. And for us, that's a lot of
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:17.420]   Costco and anywhere else that's kind of an alternative to 2x points. Over at Citi, I think there were 75,000
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.980]   point and mile welcome bonuses on both of these cards, which led me to open them up on the same day.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.460]   The Citi premiere on the consumer side, which not only had a nice welcome bonus, but I've been excited
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.620]   to get into the Citi ecosystem. As I mentioned last month in the Citi episode,
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:38.540]   not to mention it's a card that earns 3x on flights, hotels, gas, groceries, and dining. So
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:44.140]   good all around spend card, especially if someone's just looking for a one single card for a lot of
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:50.460]   bonus categories, but I'm using it off and on just to kind of get to a point of Citi points that I have
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.860]   enough to use on a redemption so that I could kind of get a taste of what it's like to be able to use
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:00.540]   a few of the transfer partners that are unique to Citi. On the American side, we opened the Advantage
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   business card, and I'm using it for a lot of other spending. And granted, those categories could
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:13.740]   otherwise earn, you know, 2x points or 2.625% cash back. And instead, I'm just getting one American mile.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:20.060]   However, I'm also getting one loyalty point, which is how they track status and the nature of this card and
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:25.260]   a promotion they have this year. We're getting one loyalty point on the employee card, which Amy works
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.340]   at the company and she has an employee card. So she's getting a loyalty point and me as the primary
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:35.260]   cardholder are. So it's helping not only earn points that you can redeem, but earn status for both of us.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:42.300]   And so there is a value to that. In fact, I think for us, earning status on American is even more valuable
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:49.740]   for flying on Alaska than earning status on Alaska, because we can actually earn a higher tier of status
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.620]   here than we could using just the Alaska card. So exciting to be in the Citi ecosystem this year.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:34:00.140]   Next is the built card. And that's really the last credit card that I have in my wallet. I know it's a
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:07.020]   lot, but despite that we do not rent, the interesting thing about the built card is that they have been
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.620]   constantly doing promotions on their rent day, which is the first of the month that allow you with built
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.420]   status to transfer to their transfer partners, which by the way, I think they have the best lineup of
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.340]   transfer partners. If you could convert all my other points to built points, I would be stoked.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:27.660]   And on rent day, they've had 100% transfer bonuses to Air France, Air Canada, Avianca Life Miles,
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:32.300]   British Airways, Avios. And those are all programs we've booked flights from in the last year.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:38.460]   So if every built point I've earned, I've been able to redeem one to two, meaning twice as many points,
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:45.260]   then the fact that the built card is only earning 3x on dining and 2x on travel, which is not too different
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.900]   from other cards, though, keep in mind, no annual fee card, which is awesome. And if you rent up to
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:57.500]   100,000 points paying your rent with no fee, amazing. But earning 3x on dining, if your points
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.980]   are always transferring at one to two is kind of like earning 6x on dining, and it's kind of like
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:07.820]   earning 4x on travel. And at that rate, it's a card that I'm pretty compelled to spend on at least to
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.220]   get to the point that I maintain that platinum status. So those points continue to be worth that much.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.940]   Only other card we have is a target red card. Technically, it's a debit card. So it probably
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.740]   shouldn't be in here. It does earn 5% back, which is pretty good for a debit card, at least on target
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:28.380]   purchases. But we've been able to at least recently get target gift cards for slightly less than 5% off
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.220]   that we've been spending a lot of money at target just using target gift cards instead of the debit
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.020]   card. But it's a debit card, it doesn't impact your credit, it has no annual fee. So there's no real
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.260]   downside to keeping it. So now that I ran through all the cards I have, I talked a little about what I want to
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.460]   do with them. Let's talk about the major categories. Now, this episode is not meant to be the definitive
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:52.540]   guide to the best card in every single category. It doesn't include a lot of cards that have 5 to 6x
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:59.980]   points in those categories if it's capped at $500 a month or $1,500 a quarter, because in a lot of cases,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:06.300]   the ROI of opening up a card for an extra 6000 points a year just doesn't make sense. Obviously,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.620]   if you downgrade to that card, and you've already had it open and has no annual fee, why not? But those
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.100]   are cards that I'm usually not going to consider opening up for new, especially because they
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.260]   usually have lower welcome bonuses. So that's why they're not here. So what I'm going to do is run
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.380]   through the categories, talk about how I landed on the card I have and what some good alternatives are,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.620]   just to kind of showcase my process here. So I'll start with dining, it's probably one of our biggest
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:36.220]   categories that we spend money on. And we use primarily the Amex gold at 4x points. But we have probably more
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:42.860]   than any other category, a lot of backups, the Chase Reserve, the Freedom Flex, the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.380]   the Built Card, all those cards are earning 3x points. If we didn't have those, you could also
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.940]   earn the same 3x points with the Chase Preferred, with the Wells Fargo Autograph and Autograph Journey
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.700]   cards, the Amex Green, the Capital One Saver. So there are a lot of options there.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:02.380]   And then if we wanted the cash back, depends on the mood, I guess. I'm still trying to grapple with
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.580]   this experiment where I told myself I'd spend money on cards with cash back this year to see how it
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.540]   feels. So stay tuned towards the end of the year when I can debrief on my feelings after doing that
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.100]   for a year. But on the cash back side, you've got the Bank of America Premium Rewards Elite card,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.300]   which because I use those points spent on dining for flights ends up being about a 4.4%
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:29.020]   back card on dining. Now, would I rather have 4 Amex points or 4.4 cents? Probably the Amex points,
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:36.300]   but not a bad card for dining. Next is Groceries. And similarly, I'm still using the 4x Gold card,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.500]   but good alternatives in my wallet are the City Premier at 3x points. And I don't have this card,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.580]   but the Saver card at 3x points as well. And then also, I forgot to mention this in dining,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.220]   but if you're a Verizon customer and you want cash back, the Verizon card I think earns 4%
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.020]   on gas, groceries and dining uncapped. So that's an interesting one if you're a Verizon customer,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.580]   though I would argue if you're a Verizon customer, you're probably spending way more on your phone
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.020]   bill than an alternative carrier that probably doesn't make up for the extra cash back from that card.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.220]   When it comes to travel, there's a bunch of categories within travel and not every card
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:17.500]   hits them all. So I'll start with the broad all/ other non-flight hotel travel. And in that category,
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:23.900]   I think the Chase Sapphire Reserve at 3x and the US Bank Altitude Reserve at 4.5% are pretty interesting.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.380]   And they're probably my primary go-to's. But if I had a lot of spend in this category,
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:33.420]   and for whatever reason, I didn't want those cards, getting 3x at Wells Fargo with the Autograph
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.580]   Autograph Journey cards is interesting, though there are limited uses for their points because they have a
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:43.340]   smaller number of transfer partners. And then also, as I'm saying this, I'm wondering if given the value
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.860]   I've gotten from transferring built points, yes, it's a 2x travel. But if those 2x are worth 4x,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.300]   then it would kind of accelerate it to be the primary travel card I should use.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.220]   So I'm actually questioning my strategy, and I might shift it after this moment.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.620]   The Amex green card also does 3x on travel. So that's interesting if you want to stay in the Amex
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.100]   ecosystem. And then on the cashback card, the premium rewards elite card is still, again,
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.300]   3.5% back on travel if you have platinum honors. And then if you use it for flights, it can be all
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:17.980]   the way up to 4.4%. On flights, I think that there's a hands-down winner that's the platinum
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   card where book a flight directly with airlines, you get 5x points. I have been asked to think about
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.780]   whether it's worth not getting the travel protections I would get if I were on another
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:34.860]   card. And so that's a really important consideration when you're booking travel is how important are
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.580]   those travel protections in case you have flight delays, canceled flights, lost bags. So that's
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:46.300]   something that I will give more credence to in a future episode. On the hotel side, I'm typically
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:52.860]   using the co-brand cards I have for those hotel chains. But outside of that, it's either the city
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   premier card, which earns 3x on hotels. If I were spending a ton on hotels, I would consider the
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:04.620]   autographed journey card, which is 5x on hotels. And then outside of those, it's just whatever kind
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.420]   of all travel card. On rental cars, I'm always using the Chase Sapphire Reserve. It has excellent
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.660]   rental car coverage. It's primary coverage. It earns 3x points. And I didn't mention that before
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:18.540]   when I went through that card. But I don't rent enough cards that I'd necessarily say like,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.900]   that's the card that I should definitely have. And it's worth the annual fee just for the rental
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:29.180]   car coverage. But it is a nice add on that I have one, my wife has one. If we're renting cars,
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:34.380]   we're always using that card. This episode is brought to you by Gelt. Now, when it comes to building wealth,

[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.420]   You know that feeling when you're standing in the grocery store, staring at labels,
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.820]   trying to figure out what's actually healthy, but that ingredient list is so confusing?
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.700]   With two young kids, we are constantly trying to make sure the whole family eats clean, healthy food,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.100]   but it can be a lot of work to make that happen. And that's why I love Thrive Market.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.380]   They're my go-to online grocery store for getting healthy essentials delivered straight to our door
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:08.940]   without ever having to leave the house. Unfortunately, there are over 10,000 food
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.820]   additives allowed in the US, and it's hard to know what's actually safe. So I love that Thrive Market
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:19.100]   bans over a thousand harmful ingredients. Their team does all the hard work and makes sure every
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.660]   product meets high quality clean standards. For example, one product we love from Thrive
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.620]   is Simple Mills. We feel so good giving it to our kids. Their sea salt almond flour crackers are
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:34.300]   fantastic, but lately I just can't stop snacking on their sweet thins. Also, Thrive Market has
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:39.100]   tons of filters so you can easily shop by whatever you need. Whether you want to find what's on sale,
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.820]   you're looking for gluten-free snacks, or you want some high-protein meals. I especially love
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:49.740]   that last one because I find the more protein I get, the less likely I am to binge on those Simple Mills
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:57.100]   sweet thins. Ready to make the switch? Head to chrishutchins.com/thrivemarket to get 30% off your
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.780]   first order plus a free $60 gift. Now, notice I didn't mention anything about the travel portal earnings.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:08.860]   Depending on your card, you might get 10x on hotels booking with the Venturex or the Chase Reserve card
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.940]   in your Chase travel portal, or 5x on flights. Or in Citi, you can get 10x on hotels, and built you get
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:20.780]   plus 1x points, and the platinum is 5x on hotels, and there's all these bonuses in the travel portals.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.860]   Now, what I want to say about travel portals, I typically don't love booking in the travel portal,
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:30.300]   because on the hotel side, the hotels are usually booked through like Expedia or some other back-end
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.540]   engine that does not give you credit for the elite nights, doesn't give your status any perks, and really
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:42.140]   puts you at the very bottom rung of the ladder in the eyes of the hotel. And so, the last thing I want
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.620]   to do is go to a hotel and get no perks, no benefits, no treatment, and if they're going
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.260]   to have to walk someone, it's going to be whoever booked in that travel portal. So, if I'm booking
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.780]   at a boutique hotel where there's absolutely no way to get elite nights or perks or benefits or anything
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:03.340]   like that, maybe it's fine. Maybe I'd go for the 10x points over something else, and I think it's
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:09.020]   probably worth the trade-off in that point. On the flight side, the challenge, and this is also true
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.260]   on the hotel side, is you often can't manage any of the bookings you've made in a portal
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.580]   directly with the hotel. You can't reach out to the hotel or the airline for that matter and say,
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.660]   "Hey, can we manage this booking?" They usually defer and say, "Hey, actually go back to where
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.020]   you booked it." And that can be a pain when you're trying to deal with last-minute changes, and you have
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:33.100]   to wait on hold for Amex Travel to answer, which I've been in a circumstance where me and another person
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.660]   booked the same flight, and we were trying to cancel it, and I booked directly with the airline, and it took
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.820]   me seconds because we were already at the airport, and I just went to the desk and said, "Can we cancel
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.660]   it?" And they were on hold trying to figure out how to get this done because they'd already checked in.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.140]   However, there's this thing called NDC, New Distribution Capability, and it's a technology
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:58.140]   within travel booking that is allowing you to book through travel portals in a way that shows up as if
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.340]   you're booking directly from the airline. And so you actually are able to manage your flight with
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.980]   the airline. You're able to cancel through the airline. You get all the same benefits as if you
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:13.100]   booked through the airline. And not every airline supports it, though I think the primary airlines in
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:19.340]   the U.S. except Delta do, but also most travel portals don't. However, the Built Travel Portal does.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:25.660]   And so as that comes online more and more, I would have no qualms booking every single flight
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.380]   through the Built Travel Portal get an extra built point for a United flight. Now, I wouldn't do it for
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.100]   a Delta flight where it might be difficult to manage because they don't have NDC. And my understanding is
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:41.020]   built in the process of trying to make it easier for you to know which ones of those bookings are getting
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:47.500]   booked through NDC so you have that treatment versus not. And I hope all these portals adopt it. If they do,
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:53.100]   you will see me booking all my flights in the portals for elevated earnings. But earning a few
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.500]   extra points on a flight isn't worth the hassle of not being able to manage that flight directly with
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:03.020]   the airline. So as I know which portals can do this, I'm down to do it. But until then,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:08.140]   I'm kind of holding off until I know exactly how it will work. Next spend category is Costco. We're
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.860]   probably using our U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve card. But since that card is not open, another card that's
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:18.300]   interesting is the Venmo card. Because I think in their grocery category, it also includes
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.740]   wholesale clubs and it's 3% cash back on everything. So obviously, you can't get the U.S. Bank Altitude
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:30.140]   Reserve card anymore. But 3% back at wholesale clubs and groceries is pretty compelling, especially if you
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:35.980]   want to start a budding Costco gold enterprise. Obviously, you could use the Bank of America cards and
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:41.260]   earn cash back there as well. On the points and miles side, I think your best option here is
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:49.180]   2x points from the Capital One Venture card. On phone spending, the in cash is 5x. On the consumer
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:54.780]   side, I wouldn't actually focus on the card that earns you the most points with your phone. And
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.660]   instead, I'd focus on which card had the best cell phone coverage in terms of cracked screen,
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.700]   lost phone, damaged stuff. And that is probably going to be better than getting a couple of
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.380]   extra points per dollar on your phone bill. And so that's something to look in.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.420]   A couple other categories. We don't have a gas car. So we don't use that category.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.860]   But I was spending a ton on gas. I'd probably look at the Wyndham Business Earner card, which is
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:22.780]   8x points on gas. And it's definitely interesting because of the way you can use Wyndham points,
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   especially with Vacasa vacation rentals. But I don't have that card. And so a card I'd probably
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:34.380]   use instead is the Citi Premier card, which is 3x points on gas. So those are the major categories
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.980]   we spend on. Obviously, in the other category, I'm always jumping between the VentureX, the US Bank
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:46.380]   Altitude Reserve. I might think about picking up a Citi Double Cash card to start earning 2x Citi points,
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:50.620]   or just keep using the Bank of America card, which, because we redeem those points for flights,
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:55.100]   it's kind of like a 3.28% cashback card. There aren't a lot of other categories
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:01.180]   we spend money on right now. The ones that I know do have cards with elevated earnings potential
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.740]   are streaming and entertainment. Obviously, if you have rent, I would strongly encourage you to look
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:11.980]   at the Built card. Allthehacks.com/built is my link. But beyond that, there aren't any categories
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.700]   that I'm necessarily shopping for an elevated earnings card. That said, I will talk about some
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:22.140]   of the new cards I'm looking at this year. And one of them does hit on a category I didn't
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:27.420]   mention. When it comes to credit cards, I haven't really been distinguishing too clearly between
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:33.340]   business and personal cards. A year ago, when I recorded the episode for What's In My Wallet 2024,
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.700]   I talked a lot about the distinction because we were using QuickBooks. And QuickBooks sucks for
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.900]   this. And so we really tried when we were using QuickBooks to completely separate all of our spending
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:49.260]   so that we only linked certain cards. And it was kind of a mess. And then I started using a product
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:55.420]   called Kick for our bookkeeping. And it was so amazing that after using it for maybe two weeks,
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.420]   I asked if I could invest in the company, which I did. Then I asked if they wanted to sponsor the podcast.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:07.100]   And so they did. So totally biased user here as an investor and a partner. But it is amazing at doing
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:12.780]   bookkeeping for your business and being able to use business and personal cards, and then just move
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:18.220]   transactions between them as they don't fall into one or the other, and makes the bookkeeping behind
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:23.020]   it really simple. You can go to allthehacks.com/kick to get a deal there. I think it's 50% off your first
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:28.460]   year of bookkeeping. But that has really made it so that I don't need as much delineation.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.380]   So when we have two cards that earn the same amount, like 3x travel on Chase Reserve and the
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.700]   Chase thing preferred, then fine, we'll separate them out and make it easy. We do the same thing for
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:40.780]   cashback on Bank of America cards. But when we don't, I'll make a purchase on my personal card.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:45.660]   And I think from a bookkeeping standpoint, I'm kind of expensing that to the business and then
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:50.940]   making that expense a contribution. And if for some reason I put a personal expense on the business card,
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.420]   then it's effectively a distribution from the business. Now, obviously, all this happens in the background
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:00.540]   with kick, it's not like I have to do all this filing with each transaction. But that's kind of how it happens.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:05.980]   If you don't like that approach, one option is to get two versions of a personal card. So for example,
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:11.500]   if you wanted to get 5x points on all flights, whether they're business or personal, and you have a partner,
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:16.300]   then your partner could open up an Amex Platinum. You could open up an Amex Platinum and you use one of the cards
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.980]   all for personal flights and one of the cards all for business flights. Okay, so that's business cards.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.380]   What do I want to do next year? What are the cards I'm excited about? Well, if you look at last year,
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:29.020]   in this episode, about 18 months ago, I was excited about the Built Card, the Delta Platinum,
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:35.260]   the Bonvoy Brilliant, Citi cards, the Capital One Saver, the US Bank Altitude Reserve,
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:39.580]   and the Wells Fargo Autograph or Autograph Journey. I ended up getting almost all of those cards. I
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:44.140]   never got the Capital One Saver and I never got the Wells Fargo cards. I didn't really see any elevated
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:49.100]   earnings potential, new kinds of points I'd be able to earn more of. So I passed on them. But I would say
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.660]   the cards I was excited about last year, I kind of ended up following through on. So I'm excited to see
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.060]   if that happens again this year. So this year, the cards I'm excited about that I don't already have,
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.420]   and that is obviously aside from any card with an exciting welcome bonus, which is probably
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.940]   something I'm going to focus a lot on this year. But the specific cards I'm interested in are the
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:14.380]   Venmo card I mentioned, because I'm spending a lot lately at Costco on gold. And that card is a great
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:19.420]   opportunity to get 3%, which gold is expensive, and I might max out on some of the other cards.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:26.220]   I have a companion pass right now. But Amy, my wife does not. And we do have two children. And so
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.980]   if I have companion pass, and we're going to do a little bit more Southwest traveling, maybe it makes
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:34.380]   sense for her to get a Southwest card, that signup bonus will get her quite a bit of the ways towards
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:39.660]   companion pass. She could get two cards, or she could get one and do a little spending or flying.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:44.700]   But it might be nice if we ended up having two companion passes, then it really is 50% off for
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.900]   the family, minus the taxes and fees on the kids, because we'd be able to both have companion pass.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.220]   Now, the only downside there is, if we wanted to travel together as a couple, we wouldn't actually
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.900]   be able to benefit from the companion pass, because we would have named our children as our companions.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:02.140]   But I think that is a champagne problem. I mentioned earlier, I'm excited about getting city points.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:07.660]   So as a way to boost them, you might see me add the city double cash, which is a 2% card on
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:13.020]   everything. But those 2% can convert to 2x points. So that might be a way before they go away. I've
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.620]   been eyeing the Hawaiian cards, which have a 75,000 point welcome bonus, or at least have in the recent
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:26.220]   past, but also allow you to transfer points between people. And so if we wanted to aggregate all of our
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:31.340]   Alaska points into one account, that would allow us to do that. And who knows what will happen to that
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:37.740]   card after the merger is totally final, which is actually in 26 days right now at the end of June,
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.620]   the venture X business, this is a card I'm not eligible for because I have the spark cash plus
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:49.660]   card. But my wife is and for the next five days, they still have a huge 350,000 point signup bonus.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:55.180]   And so that's one that's on a very tight fuse of do we go for this, it has a massive amount of minimum
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:53:00.940]   spend to hit that welcome bonus. But when you factor that welcome bonus in, it's a pretty elevated offer
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.740]   for a card that I think is interesting. And so we're thinking about it, it hasn't been enough to pull the
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:11.500]   trigger yet. But now we're kind of forced to make that decision. Also, now that Amy's working full time
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.900]   on the business, she doesn't actually have a lot of business cards. And so opening up the world of
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.060]   business cards to her portfolio is something we haven't done a ton of to date. And so that's
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.620]   something we're eyeing for this year. Business cards often have really great welcome bonuses. So excited
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:30.940]   for that. And then the last one is a new card. And I missed out on the opportunity to get a signup
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:36.780]   bonus for this card because it only lasted for a couple days. But that is the Mesa card. It is a
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:41.900]   card for homeowners. So if built is for renters, Mesa is for homeowners. It's a no annual fee card,
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.500]   no foreign transaction fee. And the primary benefit is that it earns 1x points on mortgage payments up to
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:53.180]   100,000 points a year. I'm going to do a full breakdown of this card in next week's episode.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:54:00.300]   So those are the cards that I'm interested in right now. You might be asking, okay, you just ran through
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.780]   and I don't even know the number now easily over 20 cards that we have. And now here's five or six more.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:09.340]   I'm thinking of how do I keep track of this? And so the way I'll close out this episode is just share
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:14.700]   a little bit about how I keep track of all my cards. And so there are a handful of apps that
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.980]   make this a lot easier. There's card pointers, card right, travel freely. I think you might be able
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:24.380]   to do this with a ward wallet or the points guy app. And of course you can create your own spreadsheet
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.900]   to do this as well. Personally, I really liked the card pointers app and I've used it for a long time.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:35.340]   I think it's easy to use. I think it does a lot more than what you need it to do when you think,
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:39.900]   how do I manage this? And I'm not saying you can't use the other ones, but I'll tell you why I like the
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:44.860]   app and why I decided to partner with card pointers to get a discount for all of you because I think it
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.740]   has a ton of value. So first you could just put all your cards in and you could do it without having
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:55.020]   to link your bank. So you could just say, I have an Amex Platinum and then it's added to your app and
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.380]   they keep track of all the perks and the benefits of that card because the app knows what the perks
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.940]   and benefits are of an Amex Platinum. Now, if you go in and tell it, here's the date I signed up for
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.020]   that card and then they'll know here's when your annual fees due and all that kind of stuff. So there's
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:13.500]   a view in the app where I could say, show me the calendar of all my upcoming annual fees so I can keep
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.740]   track on maybe I want to cancel a card before that happens. Maybe I want to call up and see if there's a
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.300]   retention offer, anything like that. It's also great because if you set it up with a partner,
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:28.300]   you can manage your and your partner's cards and you can actually give them a view, which is just
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.620]   here's the best card to use for different kinds of spending. So instead of maybe printing something
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.460]   out or putting labels on cards, you could say, Hey, look at the card pointers app and it'll tell you
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:42.940]   groceries, this card, gas, this card. So I like that. But the two things that I love the most is one,
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.940]   it is the place that I can manage all of the offers. And actually,
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.740]   this is two things, but it's one thing. It's all the standard offers and all the personal offers.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:55.500]   And the difference being the standard offers are all the things that come with your cards,
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.980]   your $10 a month dining credit, $50 resi credit, Hilton resort credits, all that kind of stuff.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:06.780]   It's a lot to keep track of. And so they have them all there. I can go in and I favorite all the offers
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:11.580]   that I like. And then I can say, filter this view for standard offers that I favorited, sort them by
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:16.140]   soon as to expire. And I can just scroll through a list of here's all the things I want to make sure I
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:20.620]   take advantage of before the end of the month, quarter or year. And it's how I make sure I don't
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:25.740]   lose track of the value I'm getting from all the cards I have. There's also personal offers. And
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:30.700]   those are the card linked offers you get. So with the browser extension from card pointers,
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:37.500]   anytime you log into your bank, it's going to one, check all of those offers and add them to the list.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:41.580]   So you make sure you know about them, but it's also going to add them to your card. But the really
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:47.340]   cool thing it's going to do is if you were to go add an Amex offer to one card, they'd usually take
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.740]   it away from another card. So you couldn't add it to both. But if you hit their server at the exact same
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:57.420]   time for all your cards, you can add that card to multiple cards all at once. And so that's something
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.860]   the card pointers extension also does. And so it does all this without downloading your balance data
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:08.860]   and storing your login as well, which is really cool. And so that extension not only knows about
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.380]   all those offers, but then it alerts you. So the other day we were on the site Chewy to order some
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:18.460]   things for our dog. And it popped up and said, Hey, just so you know, you should use one of these
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:25.740]   two chase cards, which has a 15 off $49 purchase, which can be up to 30% cash back. I promise you
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:29.740]   that if I had not seen that notification from the card pointers extension, I would have used a different
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:35.660]   card and I definitely would have gotten 30% off my purchase. And so that extension has probably saved me
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:41.900]   at least a thousand dollars. And now I'm also using the app to basically favorite offers that I
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:47.020]   notice like Chewy as an example. Oh, we're going to use that. Oh, here's a store that we regularly shop
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:52.780]   from. Let's not forget that there's an offer that expires in two months for $30 off $100 or something
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.860]   like that. So I'm able to make sure that I'm not only getting all the benefits from the perks that are
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:01.900]   kind of recurring regular perks of the card, but all the card linked offers. And I went and looked at the
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:06.700]   different cards I have and there are cards where I've gotten five, six, $700 of card linked offer
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.500]   value from that card. And I'm certain I would have gotten that before. So I worked with Emmanuel,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.220]   the founder, who's a member of all the hacks. He's a listener of the pod. You can all have 30%
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:20.300]   off. If you go to all the hacks.com slash card pointers, or if you're already a member of all
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:25.260]   the hacks, which you can do at all the hacks.com slash join, you get 50% off. So definitely check
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:29.740]   out card pointers. It's an app. I open up multiple times a week. I've got the extension running all the
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:35.100]   time and I love it. And if anyone listening is wondering why I don't include max rewards on this
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:40.540]   list of potential tools for this purpose, the last time I checked, they had an account linking
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:45.260]   implementation that required you link the app to your bank. And the way they implemented it was a
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:49.900]   way that at least from a security standpoint, I just wasn't comfortable with. I've shared this with
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:54.860]   them. I checked again, six or seven months later, they hadn't changed anything. If they ever do,
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:59:00.380]   I'm happy to try the app again. But until then, like, I just can't review that product because I do not
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:05.980]   trust the way that they've implemented the linking with my bank. I've emailed with the team. I don't believe
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:10.460]   they're doing anything nefarious. I think they are probably just implementing it in a way that was
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:15.260]   easiest for their engineering team to do, but I'm just not comfortable with it. And so I can't review
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.620]   it. I have heard other people use it and really enjoy it, but myself, I can't.
