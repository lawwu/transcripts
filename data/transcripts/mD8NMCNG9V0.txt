[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Today, we field a really good Bible question from an international listener to the podcast.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   "Dear Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.720]   My name is Beatrice and I live in Malaysia.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.680]   My question for you is about what the Bible means when it says, 'You are gods.'
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.860]   Says this in Psalm 82, verse 6, and then Jesus quotes it again in John 10, verse 34.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.840]   Can you explain to me what this means?"
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   Here's the situation.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.720]   In John 10, Jesus has just said in verse 30, "I and the Father are one."
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   Now the Jewish leaders who hear him say this, putting it together with everything else that
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.480]   he's been saying, infer that he's blaspheming by making himself equal with God.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.560]   So in verse 31, it says, "The Jews picked up stones to stone him."
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.300]   Now that's a crisis because the hour for Jesus' death has not yet come.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.640]   Jesus is going to die when he has chosen to die and not a minute sooner.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.000]   No one takes my life from me.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.620]   I lay it down of my own accord.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.060]   And so he has to somehow defuse this critical moment where he's about to be stoned legally
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.180]   because the Jews could stone people for blasphemy.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.780]   He's got to somehow get out of this situation so that he can make his way in his own time
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.420]   to the kind of death he intends to die.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.380]   So Jesus is going to deflect this threat in a couple ways.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.660]   First, he says, "For which of my good works are you stoning me?"
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.560]   And they answer, "It's not for your good works that we're stoning you, but for blasphemy,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620]   because you being a man make yourself God."
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.900]   In other words, from all the things that Jesus has said, including calling God his Father
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.460]   and saying that he and the Father are one, and by implication, therefore, he's the unique
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.620]   Son of God, they infer, and they infer rightly, that he's treating himself as the Son of God
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.580]   in a unique way, only they call it a blasphemous way.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.780]   And now Jesus is going to defuse the situation a second way and make his escape, which is
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.820]   what he does in verse 39.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.660]   He escaped from their hands.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.940]   How did he do that?
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980]   He does it by quoting Psalm 82.6.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.260]   He says, "Is it not written in your law, I said, 'You are gods'?
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.980]   If he called them gods, to whom the Word of God came and the Scripture cannot be broken,
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.040]   do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming'?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.220]   Because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?"
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.220]   So what's he doing?
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.480]   Let's go back and read Psalm 82.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.100]   It starts like this, "God has taken his place in the divine assembly.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.300]   In the midst of the gods he holds judgment."
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.920]   Now, who are they?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.580]   These are so-called gods and are angelic beings, which the New Testament calls principalities
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.280]   and powers in the heavenly places.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.260]   And God is about to pronounce judgment on them because they are using their authority
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   behind the authorities of the world in order to support injustice rather than justice.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.500]   So verse 2 of the Psalm says, "How long will you judge unjustly?"
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.980]   This is God talking to that assembly of gods.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.780]   How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked, give justice to
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.620]   the weak and the fatherless, maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute?
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.260]   And then, after the indictment, which he just gave, comes the condemnation from God in verse
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.980]   6, which is one Jesus quotes, and he says, "I said, 'You are gods, sons of the Most
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.100]   High, all of you, nevertheless, like men.'"
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.040]   Now, pause there.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.780]   That means he's not talking to men.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.380]   He's talking to angelic beings.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.700]   "Nevertheless, like men, you shall die and fall like any prince."
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.580]   In other words, even though you have a very exalted status as gods, principalities, powers,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.360]   angels, you're going to come crashing down just like human rulers come crashing down
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.580]   who abuse their authority.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:00.560]   So, when Jesus says that God called them gods, he's not talking about us.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.820]   This is the answer to Beatrice's question.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.280]   In fact, he's not talking to any ordinary human beings.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.720]   He's talking about and to angelic beings who are sometimes called gods in the Old Testament,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.280]   just like when Satan, you remember, comes before God in the first chapter of Job, it
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   says, "The sons of God came to present themselves to God, among whom was Satan."
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.480]   That's the sense in which "gods" is being used here, and "sons of God."
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:39.680]   So the answer to Beatrice's question is that in this text, both in Psalm 82 and in
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480]   John 10, we are not called gods.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.400]   Angelic beings are called gods, and Jesus isn't going into any elaborate argument here
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.280]   about the meaning of this psalm.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:02.460]   He is simply using this text as a shrewd escape maneuver from being about to be stoned.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.960]   They have just accused him of blasphemy because of calling himself the son of God, and he
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.040]   deflects the accusation of blasphemy by calling attention to the fact that in the Psalms,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.000]   the very term "sons of God" is used for beings less than God, and nobody accuses
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.080]   the psalmist or God himself of blasphemy, so back off!
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   If you think this means—and we might be tempted to think this means—that Jesus is
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.960]   arguing that he is only a godlike angelic being, like those gods, that would be a big
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   mistake.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.200]   He doesn't equate himself with those gods in Psalm 82.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:50.380]   In fact, he uses very exalted language and says, "Do you say of him whom the Father
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:58.400]   consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming because I said I am the Son
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   of God'?"
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.240]   So he doesn't diffuse the situation by reducing his claim to deity.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.760]   He diffuses the situation by complicating the term "son of God" for his accusers
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   so that they have to get rocked back on their hermeneutical heels in order to think for
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.880]   a minute about how to handle what he had just said from Psalm 82, and when that happens,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   he's gone.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.800]   Verse 39 says he makes his escape.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.280]   So there are interesting and important things to be learned here in Jesus' use of Psalm
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.920]   82, but that we are gods is not one of them.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   Thank you for that clarity, Pastor John, and thank you for listening.

[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   especially at work.
