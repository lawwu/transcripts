[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I want to talk about inflation
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.840]   and why people should not be freaking out about inflation. So the latest print was 7.5%
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.360]   CPI. So that's the highest inflation level in 40 years. Now personally, I don't think inflation is
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.360]   going to go much higher than 7.5%. And I don't think mortgage rates are going to go much higher,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.160]   for example, about 4% on the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Now, of course, I can be wrong.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.800]   Nobody knows the future exactly. But this is what I believe. And there are three reasons why I think
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.760]   inflation is going to start fading by the end of 2022, and most certainly into 2023. The first
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.000]   reason is rising long term bond yields. Look at the 10-year bond yield. It's gone from a low of
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.080]   0.51% in 2020 to about 2% today in February 2022. Higher rates slow down borrowing. So that's
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.240]   deflationary. The second reason is a stronger dollar. The dollar, the US dollar has done
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.720]   very well in 2021. Against a basket of currencies, the US dollar has appreciated by about 5%.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.640]   As rates rise in the United States, more foreign capital will buy our treasury bonds and our
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.720]   assets because they are relatively more attractive. And as more capital buys US dollar-denominated
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.720]   assets, our currency tends to appreciate further in value. So if we have an appreciating currency,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   that means foreign input costs become cheaper. So again, that is deflationary. And then finally,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.320]   you're seeing inventories of products across the supply chain rise. Now, they're still quite tight,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.560]   but they are rising. So if you look at supply and demand economics, if the supply curve shifts down,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   that means there is more supply at every single price point. And that also is deflationary.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.400]   America is one of the most capitalistic countries in the world. So in other words, when prices are
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   rising, a lot of people, a lot of entrepreneurs, a lot of people who want to make a lot more money
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   are thinking, how do we capitalize on rising prices? And the simple way to do so is to produce
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   more of that product. Eventually, enough people or enough companies will produce enough of that
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.760]   product where there will be an oversupply, and then there's going to be a price crash. So this is
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   the classic boom, bust, bullwhip cycle that we all know about. A great example is advertising.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   Just look at the Super Bowl commercials. A lot of them were investment ads, or cryptocurrency ads.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.080]   And why is that? Well, it's because cryptocurrencies is the flavor of the year of the moment. So
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.960]   they're going to pay the most, and they are profiting the most. And so of course, the networks
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.720]   are going to try to run these ads and also capitalize. So capitalism, capitalism is what
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.480]   is going to actually put inflation back down. Now, whether it's going to go back down to the
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.880]   long term historical average of between two to 3%, probably not, right, I think inflation is
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   probably going to fade down to about 5%, or a little bit less by the end of 2022. And then
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.360]   maybe fade down to three to 4% by 2023. But it's really hard to tell 12 months into the future.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.440]   However, I certainly don't believe like one financial reader has bet me a lot of money,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.560]   thinking that the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate is going to be above 6% by 2023. This large
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   bet, it's a $5,000 bet kind of came out of the blue. And it's also signifies how much fear and
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.240]   concern there is about inflation at the moment, in my opinion. I mean, usually bets are like $10,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.200]   $20, $50, $100. Here's a reader who wants to bet me $5,000. So I took the bet. And I took the under
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.960]   that the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage is going to be under 6% by the end of 2023.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   It's really important not to extrapolate elevated events many, many years into the future. For
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.560]   example, back in March 2020, if you're reading and listening Financial Samurai, you know, I was
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.800]   talking about how we should think about earnings, right? To predict this bottom of the stock market,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.480]   which I wrote a post about it on March, I think it's like 24th 2020, we have to look at earnings
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.440]   and where do we think earnings will bottom out and then restart recovering. And it was pretty
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.120]   analytical. And frankly, the post was spot on, right? If we had been buying, which we were,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.880]   we were buying in March, and in April, we've done very, very well. So to extrapolate, just
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.640]   doom and gloom for many, many years when everything was already cratering, was a mistake.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   And so right now with inflation at 40 year highs, to extrapolate inflation, staying at these levels
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.640]   seven and a half, 8%, 9%, 10%, for years and years to come, and thinking the Federal Reserve is going
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   to hike, you know, 10 times 2%, 3%, 4%, and push mortgage rates all the way up back over 6%. And
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.520]   then just really tighten and crush the economy. That is also unwise, in my opinion. If you look
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.000]   at rates, the bond market is doing the Fed's work for them, right? Because the 10 year bond yield
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560]   and other bond yields have risen. And the Fed hasn't done anything yet, right? The Fed is
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.200]   probably going to hike at least 25 base points, if not 50 basis points in March, and they're going
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.040]   to continue to hike probably by another 1% on the Fed funds rate. And that's the short end of the
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.480]   yield curve. So even if they go to one and a half percent, the 10 year bond yield is at 2%. So the
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   yield curve is still upward sloping, although it's really flat. And before the Fed gets to the end of
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.120]   2023, it will probably change its mind a little, whether it's in terms of the pace of rate hikes,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.400]   or the amount of rate hikes. So please be careful about extrapolating elevated events, or really one
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.880]   or two standard deviation events many years into the future. Finally, since there are no certainties,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.680]   there's no 100% certainty with any type of bet or investment, we have to be humble enough to
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.520]   realize we could get it wrong. I believe with 85% certainty, the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.800]   is not going to be above 6%. And it's not even going to touch 6% by the end of 2023. But that
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.760]   also means that I think there's a 15% chance I'll be wrong. So many things have happened,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.680]   black swan events happen all the time. Therefore, we really need to have the humility that we could
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.080]   be wrong. And we probably will be wrong if we take risks, take action for a long enough period of
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.400]   time. But the good thing is when we're wrong, we'll learn from our mistakes. And then we'll
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   calibrate our investments better going forward. I'd love to hear your thoughts on where you think
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.840]   mortgage rates and inflation rates will be going in 2022 and 2023. Do you think I'm going to win
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.880]   the bet or a reader is going to win the bet? And why? It's really important to think about these
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   things if we're going to be putting our capital at risk. And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.880]   love a five star review and a positive comment. Thanks.
