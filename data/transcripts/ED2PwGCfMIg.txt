[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.060]   Psalm 57.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.360]   Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.980]   For my soul takes refuge in you,
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.660]   and in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.740]   until destruction passes by.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.100]   I will call to God most high,
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.300]   to God who accomplishes all things for me.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.460]   He will send from heaven and save me.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.860]   He who approaches him who tramples upon me.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.120]   God will send his loving kindness and his truth.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.520]   My soul is among lions,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.080]   I'm lying down among those who breathe forth fire.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.200]   Sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.820]   and their tongue is sharp sword.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.200]   Be exalted above the heavens, O God,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.760]   let your glory be above all the earth.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.400]   They have set a net for my steps,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.720]   my souls bow down, they dug a pit before me.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.380]   They themselves have fallen into the midst of it.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.080]   My heart is set, O God, my heart is set.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.280]   I'll sing, yes, I'll sing praises.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.840]   Awake, my glory, awake, harp and lyre,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.500]   I will awaken the dawn.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.500]   I'll give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.740]   I'll sing praises to you among the nations,
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.500]   for your loving kindness is great to the heavens
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.580]   and your truth to the skies.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.140]   Be exalted above the heavens, O Lord,
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.740]   let your glory be above all the earth.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.240]   Psalm 57.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.820]   (gentle music)
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.880]   you
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940]   you
