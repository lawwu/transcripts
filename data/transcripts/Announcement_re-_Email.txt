[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.200]   Hey, Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets, and today I just have a quick announcement and frankly, an apology to you with regard to email.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.500]   I wanted to do it in a public forum here where you would be able to get the message clearly.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.000]   Very quickly, if you have emailed me in the past through my contact form or even directly at Joshua Radical Personal Finance dot com,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   especially through the contact form on the website, if you've emailed me that way and you have not gotten a response from me,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600]   please assume that I never actually received your email.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000]   And the story is that when we switched to the new website,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I've been emailing corresponding with you guys via announcing my personal email address again, Joshua Radical Personal Finance dot com.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.200]   But then in building the new website a year or so ago, we put a contact form on the website.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   At the time that we installed that contact form, we tested everything.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.500]   Everything was working great. And for several months, I received email contacts through that website.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.700]   However, in about July of 2015, that contact form stopped working.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700]   I don't fully understand all the reasons why. It's some kind of back office issue.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.200]   My web developer spent hours on the phone with Bluehost trying to get the thing resolved.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   Finally, we're in the process of moving it away from Bluehost and trying to fix the issue.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   But they know about the issue, but we never figured out how to make it work.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   So sometime in about July of 2015, the web contact form stopped working.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   And it wasn't until mid February 2016 that I just kind of figured it out when several people had said,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   "Hey, I tried to contact you and I didn't get a response."
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   I'm thinking I never got an answer. Rookie mistake. Totally a rookie mistake.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   No excuses for it. I was busy and I never even noticed it.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   I was still getting some emails directly and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   And then when we went and checked and I just said, "Look, we're not getting things through this form."
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   But I wanted you to know because now since we fixed the form, I'm getting three, four, five, six important emails a day.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Questions from listeners, feedback, personal comments.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   And it's disheartening to me that perhaps many of you feel ignored.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   I don't promise that I can always keep pace with email.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   Up until now, every person who's ever emailed me directly, I've responded with at least a short note,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   with at least something to say I've read and appreciated the email and if possible, I try to expand on that.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   I'm often a few weeks behind.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Just simply letters come in and emails come in and I have to prioritize pretty ruthlessly in order to get stuff done.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   But if you've emailed me, especially through the web contact form at any time since July,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   and if you never received a response, please just assume I never received it and I would just ask you go ahead and communicate with me again.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   The web form is now working.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   That's often the safest way to do it and you can go ahead and send in right on the contact forms on the website.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   You can communicate with me through there.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Feel free to use that.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   That'll go straight to my inbox or you can email me directly, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   There's always a danger if you email directly that the spam filters might grab things.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   So the safer thing is to use the contact form on the website.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   That'll bypass the spam filters.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   But I just wanted you to know, public apology if I've ignored an email from you.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   It wasn't intentional.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   So please go ahead and feel free to get back in touch with me.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   I'd love to hear from you.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   I solicit any of your comments, any of your feedback, any of your questions, and you can expect at this point, again, I don't promise forever,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   but at this point at least you can expect a personal reply from me.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   My apologies.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   You live and learn.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   I'm Joshua Timmons.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   I'll see you next time.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Take care.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   [Music]
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   Just dream about paradise.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   Escape the ordinary with Fiji Airways Global Beat the Rush sale.
