[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Last week we talked about Bible memorization and how to accomplish
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   extended memorization of entire chapters and even whole books of the Bible. This
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760]   conversation on memorization forces on us the inevitable question about
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   translations and of course we are blessed with many good English
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.880]   translations to choose from, but Pastor John, when setting out on a major project
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   like this to invest hours of time memorizing whole chapters of the Bible,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.920]   how important is it to settle on a specific translation you will use for
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   years to come, maybe for the rest of your life, or is this decision really not a
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.560]   big one? That's a great question. Here's my thought, a little history. Growing up I
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.240]   was given a King James Bible when I was small and I used it until I was 19 and I
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.400]   memorized a lot of scripture as a kid in those days and so to this day I have a
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.360]   lot of old authorized version or King James Version language in my head. When I
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.120]   was 19 I made a very significant choice and this is the choice I think you're
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.240]   asking whether people need to make and I think the answer is they do. I made a
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:23.560]   choice to move to a more modern translation and in 1965 when I made that
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.040]   decision I chose the RSV and I used the RSV for my personal devotions from 1965
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.000]   to the mid 90s, so 30 years or so, and I memorized from that. I would probably be
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.840]   using it to this day if it hadn't gone out of print because I had so much of it
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   in my head but it went out of print. You can't get an RSV. You can get a new RSV
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.600]   but that's not the same anymore. It's changed in significant ways, some of them
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.360]   politically correct that don't help me at all. So I had to make a choice. Now
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   what do I do? And that's the time in history where I really was rejoicing
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.960]   that Crossway Books had gotten the copyright to the RSV from the National
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.200]   Council of Churches and had planned to do a light revision of it to preserve
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.160]   the lineage because the lineage does go from King James through the
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.760]   American Standard Version to the new, through the Revised Standard Version to
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.720]   the ESV. So when the ESV came out I looked at it I thought this is it, this
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.600]   is the RSV with very few changes. So I was able to make that transition
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   and stay in the stream of King James, RSV, ESV, and so I'm happy that I
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.960]   made both of those changes. Now I do suggest people make a settled
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.200]   change because if you're going to do significant long-term memory it will be
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.160]   very difficult to jump around in translations because the mind gets
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.000]   locked in and it needs to get locked into certain wording so that it doesn't
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.920]   have to be self-conscious as it's reciting the Bible and can focus on the
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.800]   meaning. That's one of the great values of having it become second nature and
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.600]   all those synapses in the brain just clicking away automatically with
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   the words you've used so that you can focus on meaning and the people you're
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.720]   talking to. So if I were to suggest I would say if you don't want to
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.400]   take my word for it go to the leaders of your church and ask them what are
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.200]   we going to be using here for the long haul? Do you have any suggestions for me?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.480]   I'm going to do significant memorization I don't want to have to be changing what
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.400]   would you say that we settle in on? And so I don't think you want to use a
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.360]   idiosyncratic translation so it'd be one of those you know one of the ones that
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.240]   are pretty near the center. The NIV is going to stick around for a long time
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   I'm sure. The New King James is probably going to be around for a long time. The
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.000]   NASB is a little wooden but it's going to be around and the ESV has proven for
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.040]   me to be most helpful in being something you can read in public something you can
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.960]   have kids memorize and something I can memorize. It's a pretty sober,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.400]   respectful, traditional, and yet I think modern and understandable translation. So
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   that's a really good question and my own vote is for the ESV but boy it's just
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.400]   far better to be memorizing any version than to be memorizing none. Yes that is
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.160]   the most important takeaway. Thank You Pastor John. From memorizing the language
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.040]   of the Bible to talking about the language of cussing, yes cussing, tomorrow
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   we'll talk about swearing and this question, "Is it ever right for a
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.480]   Christian to cuss in order to provoke others towards a noble end?" Until then
