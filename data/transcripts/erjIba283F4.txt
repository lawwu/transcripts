[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.420]   - I'm at the Vogelheads Conference 2023.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.580]   - We love coming to the Vogelheads meetings.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.220]   - Being here is like going to Disneyland.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.100]   - We just love learning more about investing
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.740]   and making the most of our money.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.400]   - It's a very broad community,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.500]   but I think that the common theme that binds them
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400]   is that they really want to be able to make the most
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.580]   of their resources.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.340]   - One of the things that I think is really different
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.060]   about the Vogel Center for Financial Literacy
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.820]   is that it educates us to be do-it-yourself investors
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420]   and understand spending, understand investing,
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.620]   understand saving.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.700]   - I realize how much I do not know about personal finance,
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.900]   and I think Vogelhead Conference
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.340]   brought a lot of that to light.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.660]   - The one thing that separates you from your money
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.820]   quicker than anything is the lack of knowledge.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.140]   And oftentimes, there are not a lot of places
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.660]   where you feel you can get information that is unbiased,
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.600]   and that's what this conference is.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.860]   - For me, the value has been being able to meet people
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.720]   during the breakout sessions, during the breakfast,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.980]   during the lunch, passing in the hall.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.620]   - I loved kind of being immersed in the community.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.780]   Vogelheads are like the smartest people I know.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.500]   - We had access to talk to the speakers,
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.140]   and they are all very down-to-earth and very welcoming
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.060]   for us to walk up to them and talk to them.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.300]   And just to be able to chat with them one-on-one,
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.260]   face-to-face, it's just an in-person experience.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.740]   You can't get watching them or reading a book.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.500]   - You can listen to YouTube and podcasts and online,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.620]   and there's so much information out there.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.380]   I think what the Vogelhead Conference does
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.460]   is bring it all together in one place.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.300]   - If you're interested in investing, it's really terrific.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.620]   Even if you're just getting started,
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.660]   I think I would encourage everyone to attend this.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.460]   - Get here, get here, this will be your best experience.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.700]   It's kind of become like a family affair.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.860]   - It's like a love fest every time we see these people,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.060]   and we just keep coming back.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.100]   (upbeat music fades)
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.680]   (upbeat music)
