[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   A listener named Bruce writes in, "Dear Pastor John, I haven't read your book, Don't
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   Waste Your Life. The title is convicting enough. The fact is that I have already wasted it,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.080]   or at least it feels that way. For decades, I've tried a variety of different careers.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.160]   None of them worked. I tried starting my own business for over 20 years while my wife worked.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.480]   I earned a PhD, moved to a country where I didn't speak the language for my wife's
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   business, and I had a breakdown. Several years later, my wife and I separated. I'm now 64.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.320]   I live in a small mobile home, and I do work that any 18-year-old could do. Those are my
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.440]   boss's words. The company is good to me. My boss is a Christian, and I can earn a living.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.180]   But each day feels like nothing more than an exercise in waking up in the morning, getting
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.720]   through the day, and going to bed at night." What advice can you give to someone who has
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.040]   already wasted his life? Bruce, as I paused to pray over this question
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.960]   when I first heard it, I believe the Lord brought five things to my mind for you that
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.280]   I hope will be of encouragement. Of course, I don't know you, and I don't even know
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:28.600]   if you're a Christian. But I have written and done many podcasts on the dynamics of
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.080]   the spiritual life, which maybe you do or you don't have. So I'm just going to assume
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.700]   the best, okay? I'm going to assume you're a Christian and that you have really struggled
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.880]   to be a Christian over these years. So that's my big assumption. Now, here are my five gifts.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.380]   One, there have been evidences of grace in your life over the past decades. There have
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.760]   been. And these are important for three reasons, these evidences of grace. One is that they
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.640]   really are evidences that you belong to Jesus. They are the sorts of things you wouldn't
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.240]   have done if you weren't a Christian, if you were a merely natural man rather than
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.520]   spiritual indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Second, they will be acknowledged by the Lord on the
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   last day, these evidences of grace, to your joy. And third, as pebbles dropped in the
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.880]   pond of history, they didn't fall in vain. God turned every one of those evidences of
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.120]   grace in your life. He turned every one of them. And I would even add your failures for
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   his own wise purposes. All of that to say, beware of overstating the waste of the past.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.560]   You might find yourself sounding humble, but in fact dishonoring grace.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:14.000]   And the thief on the cross wasted his entire life, except for the last few hours. He repented,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.080]   and Christ promised him that in a few hours he would be with him in paradise. This thief
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.720]   will face a judgment according to works, like all of us. And the only good works that he
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   will have to offer will be the good works of the last three hours, or however many it
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:45.400]   was, on the cross, the time between his conversion and his death. Those good works would include,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.880]   for example, the rebuke that he gave to the other thief. "We deserve this. He doesn't.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.440]   Why don't you wake up? That's a good work. That's a good work. That's a beautiful
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.480]   act." In other words, there will not be very many works in this man's life to commend.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.760]   Everything he did up to that point was sin because he didn't do it from faith, Romans
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:18.880]   14, 23. But those few, this handful of works that he did on the cross before he died will
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   be enough to give evidence that he was born again and welcome.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.920]   Now the reason I mention that for you is not because any of us would want to be content
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:39.080]   with a handful of good deeds, but that you are 64 years old. Perhaps you have, if you're
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.400]   average, 15 years of life in front of you. And if my math is correct, you may have 75,000
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.840]   more hours to do good deeds than the thief on the cross did. Now that's absolutely
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.960]   stunning. In other words, there is a huge segment of your life in front of you. And
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.400]   I don't say huge compared to 64. I know it's small compared to 64. I say huge compared
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:15.080]   to three hours on the cross or millions of people, millions upon millions of people have
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.800]   less life to live than you do. It is incalculable what can be achieved for Jesus in 15 years.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:34.680]   Jesus served publicly for three years. So don't waste the rest of your life by fretting
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.280]   over the past.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.680]   Third, God has a new dream for you that is not wasteful. Remember what the apostle Paul
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.520]   said in Philippians 3, "Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.320]   lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:02.720]   Jesus." Surely the reason he said, "Forgetting what lies behind," is because the past
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.480]   regularly functions for us as a ball and chain around our feet, either because we failed
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.960]   and we feel hopeless or because we succeeded and feel proud. Better to forget the past
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   in that way and dream a new dream.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:29.000]   Fourth, in dreaming your new dream for your life, keep in front of you this truth. How
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.040]   you do what you do is vastly more important in the eyes of God than what you do. I understand.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.280]   I mean, I think I can understand that having a PhD and doing what any 18-year-old can do
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.880]   probably feels like bad stewardship or failure. But remember, there are thousands of people
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.160]   with PhDs working in universities and displeasing the Lord God Almighty more than millions of
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.000]   teenagers who are walking by the Holy Spirit. It is not where you work or what you do that
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.760]   pleases the Lord. It is whether you live by the Spirit, whether you walk by faith, whether
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.080]   you pursue holiness, whether you love people, whether you grow in grace, whether Christ
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.880]   is more precious to you than anything.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.920]   So Bruce, when I say, "Dream a new dream," I don't know whether the Lord means for you
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:39.640]   to have a new job, and I don't care very much. Sorry. I care enormously that you do what
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.440]   your hand finds to do in the name of the Lord Jesus, in love for people, for the glory of
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.720]   God flat out for 15 years. That's what I care about.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   And finally, number five, Bruce, gather around you a few friends who love Christ and pour
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.640]   out your heart to them about your sense of failure and ask them to join you in praying
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:18.560]   earnestly and expectantly that God will open a new chapter of usefulness for you, for joy,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.120]   for worship, a new humility that's willing to acknowledge, like you do, all the failures
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.800]   of the past, a simplicity in the present, and a blood-bought hope for the future.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:38.600]   So God bless you, Bruce. I will be eager to hear, if I live long enough, how God has made
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.200]   your last chapter the best. I'm surely at 70 praying mine will be.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.640]   Those are wise and helpful words. Thank you, Pastor John. And Bruce, that was an excellent
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.000]   humble question that really presses into a reality that a lot of listeners face in different
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.020]   ways. And if you're struggling with a dilemma in your life or if you're having a hard time
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.660]   dealing with regret, share your struggle with us and see that you're not alone. Email me
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.920]   your question and askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.840]   Well, sometimes the greatest questions on this podcast are simple, like the three-word
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.960]   question on the table tomorrow. What is worship? Pastor John and I will return tomorrow. I'm
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.280]   your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
