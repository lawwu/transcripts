[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   A podcast listener named Luke writes, "Dear Pastor John, I want to first thank you for
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.160]   the Ask Pastor John podcast and for your obedience and love to the Lord.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.280]   One thing I have always struggled to communicate is the difference between the Old Testament
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.840]   law and the fulfilled law after Christ.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.620]   I have many atheist friends who press me here, specifically when it comes to homosexuality.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.660]   Why do we as Christians not believe practicing homosexuals should be killed for their sin,
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.600]   if that is exactly the prescription in our Bibles in Leviticus chapter 20, verse 13?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.380]   How would you answer this objection?"
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:50.440]   This is huge and absolutely crucial, and we need an answer for it to those who ask.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.180]   It's such a common response for somebody who has a smattering of knowledge or has just
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.580]   read that there are these verses in the Bible like that.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.540]   And it's not difficult to answer this problem.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.300]   It just takes a little willingness on the part of people to listen for a few minutes
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.260]   as we describe the nature of the Christian Bible.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.480]   So you have to ask for a few minutes.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.740]   It might be helpful to start with an analogy.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.340]   I think right off the bat, this might be helpful.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.380]   You might say to the person who's asking that question, "Suppose a book is written for the
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.700]   military and in chapter one, it deals with how soldiers should relate to each other during
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.540]   basic training stateside.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.060]   Chapter two deals with how soldiers should relate to each other and to their captured
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.640]   enemies on the battlefield.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.960]   Chapter three deals with how soldiers should relate to each other and to their captors
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.500]   if any of them is taken captive and in prison.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.340]   And the fourth chapter deals with how they should relate to each other and to the enemy
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.100]   if they are infiltrated behind enemy lines.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:22.580]   Should anyone accuse a soldier of disobedience if while he is captured as a prisoner of war,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.940]   he obeys the instructions in chapter three rather than the instructions in chapter one?
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.700]   No, nobody would.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.580]   That's the way the book intends to be used.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.420]   Now that's the kind of book the Bible is.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.480]   It was written under God's inspiration over a period of 1,500 years or so through various
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.540]   periods where God dealt with his people in different ways.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.900]   Not everything that the Bible designed for God's people—Israel under the judges or
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.740]   under the kings or that God designs for Christians under the apostles in the New Testament—is
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.340]   the same.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.180]   Putting to death adulterers, putting to death homosexuals, putting to death the sons who
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.500]   cursed their parents—all these penalties belonged to a particular season in the history
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.060]   of God's dealings with his covenant people, and those dealings have changed dramatically
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.660]   with the coming of God's Son, Jesus Christ, into the world.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.660]   That's the basic nature of the Bible and of redemptive history that we need to get
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.980]   across to our critics.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:55.700]   Then if they're willing to take a few more minutes with us to examine the Bible, we can
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.060]   point them to the very places in the Bible where this becomes plain.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.740]   So maybe it would be helpful if I just gave a few of those, and this would be a guideline
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.860]   for how you—what text would you use if you sat down with your atheist friend who said,
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.460]   "No, I think you Christians are inconsistent because you're not putting homosexuals to
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.140]   death because it says right here in Leviticus that that's what you're supposed to do."
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.140]   So here's a few.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.940]   First, the first pointer of how things have changed dramatically.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.820]   Matthew 5:17, Jesus says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.820]   prophets.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.100]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:47.620]   So all the Old Testament finds its completion and fulfillment in Jesus, and that's a basic
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.380]   truth that a person needs to understand.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.420]   Everything in the Old Testament was pointing toward Jesus as the Son of God incarnate,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.100]   dying, rising to save His people, and therefore in His person, in His ministry, the whole
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.220]   Old Testament reaches a climax and is dramatically altered.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.820]   Second pointer, the Bible spells out many of the specifics of this dramatic alteration.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.300]   For example, the book of Hebrews is probably the classic place for showing how the Old
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.100]   Covenant has become obsolete with the coming of the New Covenant.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.900]   Chapter 8, verse 13, "In speaking of a new covenant, He makes the first one obsolete,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.740]   and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.820]   And for example, the death of Jesus is the once-for-all sacrifice for sins so that the
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:01.180]   entire Old Testament sacrificial system of offering animals comes to an end.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.820]   Hebrews 7, 27, 9, 12, "Jesus is the final Lamb of God."
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.820]   The whole Old Testament sacrificial system is over, doesn't apply anymore.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.460]   Another example from Hebrews is that Jesus Himself offers the sacrifice of Himself, and
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.460]   therefore Jesus is the final priest, and you don't need any more priests.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.580]   And so the entire Old Testament priesthood is removed.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.580]   It's over.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.740]   We have one new, final, eternal High Priest, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.620]   A third example is that Jesus saw Himself as the new temple.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.220]   If you destroy this temple, I'll build it in three days.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.980]   And He meant, I'll rise from the dead in three days.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.540]   So when the temple was destroyed in 70 AD, the place of worship for Christians was not
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.760]   destroyed because we don't have a place for worship that is limited geographically.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   We have Jesus.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.700]   And any place Jesus is, we can worship.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.100]   So all those specifics are how the Old Covenant was becoming obsolete, and dramatic changes
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.020]   came about, and hundreds of commands in the Old Testament don't apply to Christians anymore
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.980]   because this new phase of redemptive history has come.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.740]   A third pointer to this dramatic alteration between Old and New Testament is that the
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.300]   Christian life is put on a completely new footing from law.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.500]   Romans 7, 6, "Now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive,
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:35.140]   so that we serve in the new way of spirit, not the old way of a written code."
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:42.460]   A fourth pointer is that Jesus said about the people of Israel in Matthew 21, 43, "I
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.500]   tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you," political, ethnic Israel,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.300]   "and given to a people producing its fruits," that is, the Christian church.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.980]   And what that marks is a dramatic change from the old theocratic, ethnic orientation on
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.500]   one people group, namely Israel, to a new kind of people who are not a political entity,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.460]   they're not an ethnic entity ruled by a political or governmental leader, but they are a people
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.620]   scattered like exiles away from heaven, their homeland, on the earth, mingling among all
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.660]   the ethnic groups of the world with a king in heaven, not on earth, so that Jesus says
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.940]   to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.660]   If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting that I might not
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.500]   be delivered over to the Jews, but my kingdom is not of this world."
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:46.460]   And so the church doesn't function any longer, like Israel did, as a national or political,
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:53.620]   governmental agency, and therefore does not coerce its beliefs with the sword.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:02.140]   Fifth pointer is the way that Christians are freed from the old theocratic, ethnic orientation
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.140]   that needed all kinds of cultural distinctives which the Jews had to set it apart from the
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.140]   nations.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:16.220]   Mark 7, 19, Jesus declared all foods clean.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:24.300]   So the entire dietary law system of the Old Testament is wiped away because we don't need
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.460]   to distinguish ourselves from all the nations of the world.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.420]   We are part of the nations of the world.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.900]   We eat whatever we're offered because we're on an evangelistic mission to win people from
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.740]   all the peoples of the world among whom we are a part.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.180]   Another example would be circumcision.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.860]   Circumcision was the defining trait of Israel among the nations, and in Galatians 5, 6,
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.300]   we're told it doesn't longer count for Christians.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.080]   It's not required for Christians anymore.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.420]   And a sixth pointer to this dramatic alteration between Old and New Testament is Matthew 5,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.960]   38, and 39.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.140]   You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.460]   But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:18.740]   Or another example of change in moral expectations is where Jesus talks about divorce.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.620]   In Matthew 19, 7 and 8, he says this.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.900]   They ask him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and send
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.300]   her away if you say we shouldn't divorce?"
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.940]   And here's what he answers.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:40.660]   He said, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.500]   But from the beginning, it was not so."
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.580]   In other words, even though Moses made this provision, I don't anymore.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.420]   So you can see changes coming to the world with Jesus in the moral expectations upon
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.980]   the people of God.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:02.900]   Now finally, directly to the point about homosexuals being executed in the Old Testament, is the
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:13.940]   New Testament, when it is presented with an executable offense, dealt with it differently.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:22.900]   For example, 1 Corinthians 5, the early church was confronted with a man who was having sex
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.220]   with his stepmother, evidently.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.820]   Might have been his mother-in-law.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.920]   It was an intra-family, horrendous sexual sin that even the nations around the church
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.020]   thought was evil.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   It goes like this, "It is actually reported that there is a sexual immorality among you
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:50.420]   and of a kind that is not tolerated even among the pagans, for a man has his father's wife."
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:56.700]   When Paul dealt with that, which was in the Old Testament an offense so egregious it would
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.700]   have been dealt with by stoning, killing, execution.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.220]   And Paul did not, of course, prescribe stoning or execution.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.060]   He prescribed church discipline.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:17.220]   And that's a clear example of how dramatic the changes have become between chapter 1
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.400]   in the military book and chapter 4 in the military book.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:29.160]   So our overall aim in dealing with our critics who don't know their Bibles is to direct them
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.280]   to Jesus, who is the goal of everything in the Bible, and to try to help them see that
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:46.000]   God has been moving through history in different ways at different times to bring us into a
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.800]   relationship with Jesus for the salvation of our souls.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.360]   Yeah, man, that's so important.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.000]   I should also point out that this entire argument applies to the popular year of living biblically
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.600]   experiments, which are just a tangled hermeneutical and ethical mess.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   And nevertheless, people all the time try to pull off a living biblically for a year
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   experiment where they make none of these old covenant and new covenant distinctions that
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.120]   Scripture calls for.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.620]   What is the most terrible thing in the world?
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.160]   Is it the inability of a Christian to defend themselves with a pistol?
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   Or is there something worse to be feared?
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.920]   John Piper will return tomorrow to explain.
