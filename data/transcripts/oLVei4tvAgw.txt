[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   The key thing is, you gotta be on the right curve.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.080]   If you're 50 or 60 years old, you're like,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.960]   "Ah, I'm struggling to keep up with the 30-year-olds."
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.080]   You're doomed, man, you're doomed.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.600]   You're gonna feel horrible about yourself.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.440]   You're gonna run circles around you.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   But here's what you need to do.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.080]   You need to school them with your wisdom.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.280]   This has so much potential for rockin' our world
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   because we basically, you're on the first curve,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.120]   and here's the thing.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.160]   If you wanna be happy and successful,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.520]   you gotta jump to the second curve.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.480]   You gotta go from the Elon Musk to the Dalai Lama.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.520]   You gotta go from the innovator to the instructor.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.120]   You might change jobs, you might not,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.680]   but you gotta retool your life
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.520]   and what you're paying attention to
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.400]   and what you're trying to do.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.520]   That's the first big skill
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040]   of people who get happier as they age.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.200]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so happy you're here,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   but there is always room for more happiness,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.680]   and that's exactly what we're talking about today.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.480]   I'm joined by Arthur Brooks,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.120]   a social scientist who studies human happiness
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   and teaches about it and leadership
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.720]   as a professor at Harvard.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.240]   He's the best-selling author of 12 books,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.920]   including his most recent
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.160]   and the topic of our conversation today,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   Finding Success, Happiness, and Deep Purpose
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.920]   in the Second Half of Life,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560]   which debuted last month at the number one spot
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680]   on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.840]   He's also the creator of the popular
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.440]   How to Build a Life column in The Atlantic,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.680]   and he previously served for 10 years
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   as the president of the American Enterprise Institute,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.280]   a think tank in DC,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800]   during which time he was named
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.240]   as Fortune Magazine's World 50 Greatest Leaders.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.240]   Arthur is clearly a wealth of knowledge,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   and I am excited to chat with him
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   about how we can all live more happier and fulfilling lives.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.000]   We'll dig into the tactics and hacks you need
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.840]   to start putting these lessons into practice today,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.820]   and hopefully also touch a bit on the links
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.700]   between money and happiness.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.340]   There is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.680]   Arthur, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.280]   - Thanks for having me, I'm delighted.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560]   It's gonna be great.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.240]   - You know, when I first read the title of this book,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.920]   I thought, maybe this book is for my parents
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.800]   and it's not for me.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   Now, I've since learned that that's maybe not the case,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.400]   but could you talk about who the book's for
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.240]   and how that's different
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.080]   from maybe the time of your life that it's about?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.760]   - This is a book that basically says
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.980]   you don't have to leave your happiness up to chance
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.120]   as you get older.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.080]   And there are people who are old who are gonna read it,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.400]   and there are people who wanna get old,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.640]   and there are people who are getting older,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   and that is 100% of the population.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.720]   And a lot of people think,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.980]   am I gonna be happy when I'm old?
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.820]   I don't know.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.760]   Hope so, live right, hope for the best.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   And this book is basically a claim based on science
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.560]   and talking to the happiest people
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   and the unhappiest people as they get older
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.000]   that we don't have to leave our happiness up to chance.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   You can build a happiness 401k.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.640]   Now, we all know, and you know perfectly well,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.080]   'cause you do a lot of stuff in finance,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.940]   that the sooner you start your savings,
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240]   the better it's gonna look when you're older.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480]   So this is about happiness in the second half of life,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.320]   but it's about starting to get happier
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.820]   in the first half of life.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.400]   So this is for 25-year-olds, my students,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.480]   and 45-year-olds, and 65-year-olds,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   and basically everybody.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.320]   - I love that.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.420]   I think we all want to be happy,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240]   but one thing I think it's important
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   to get on the same page
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500]   is how are we defining happiness in these conversations?
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.860]   Here and in the book.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.220]   - Yeah, so a lot of when I,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.400]   that's the first thing I ask my students.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.720]   I have this MBA class that I teach
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.560]   at Harvard Business School.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.720]   It's a really oversubscribed class
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.200]   called Leadership and Happiness.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.160]   And the first day of class,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.480]   I go around and say, "What's happiness?"
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.960]   And they start talking about their feelings.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.400]   It's you feel the way you feel when dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.520]   It's the feeling of whatever.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.800]   That's not right.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.440]   That's like saying that Thanksgiving dinner
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.120]   is the smell of the turkey.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.040]   That's not the Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   That's evidence of the Thanksgiving dinner
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.020]   that you can perceive.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.760]   Happy feelings are evidence of happiness.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.880]   Happiness is something else.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.180]   When I look at the social scientists
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.960]   and people who are happy and unhappy,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.760]   happiness is a combination of three.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.700]   You might say they're macronutrients.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.000]   So food, as we all know,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.920]   and all your listeners know,
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.600]   food can be defined in terms of three macronutrients,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.380]   protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.640]   And you have to have them in balance and abundance
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   if you're gonna feel good,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.220]   if you're gonna have good health and feel good.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.360]   Happiness has three macronutrients
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.240]   that you need in balance and abundance.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.640]   You need enjoyment, you need satisfaction,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.040]   and you need purpose.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.400]   When I meet somebody who's not happy,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.280]   I start looking diagnostically at these three things.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.120]   And so the first practical takeaway
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.040]   that comes from all this theory
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.960]   is that if somebody's like,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.080]   ah, my life isn't complete,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.360]   some things are good, some things aren't,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.320]   but I'm not really happy,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.900]   it means there's a lack of balance in one of these things.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.120]   Either you don't have enough enjoyment in your life,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.040]   or you're actually not hitting goals,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.840]   which means you don't have satisfaction,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.760]   or you don't have a sense of purpose
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.920]   and direction in your life.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.680]   It's one of those three things.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.880]   And so that's the first place to start looking
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.620]   if you feel like you're not where you wanna be
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.360]   in terms of your happiness.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.200]   - And is there some kind of easy way
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.280]   someone listening could say,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.240]   well, which one is it?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.960]   Like, is there like a quiz or a question
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.000]   you can ask yourself for each one of those things
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.280]   to figure out how you are on each one,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.360]   maybe rate them?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.440]   - Yeah, there actually are.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.160]   And that's why I write my column in "The Atlantic"
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.040]   every Thursday morning,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.240]   'cause I'm digging into different aspects of that.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.480]   And so the column in "The Atlantic"
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.920]   has got a whole bunch of quizzes.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   You know, you click on 'em, you can take 'em,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.760]   or even people who are kind of into it,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.880]   they wanna read a little bit of the underlying research.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.920]   Sometimes I'll talk about it
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.680]   like the Greek philosophers did.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.460]   So Epicurus said, "Happiness is all enjoyment."
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.320]   And the Stoics said, "Happiness is all virtue and meaning."
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.400]   And the truth is, we need to be both.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   And so I have a column about,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.640]   are you more Epicurus or are you more Epictetus?
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.560]   And it says, and it actually has a quiz in there
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.400]   on how to do that.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   So my column on that is actually a good way
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.760]   to start to test yourself.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.040]   - Okay, we'll link to the column
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   and maybe some of those quizzes in the show notes.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.380]   But one of the things I saw in the book
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.000]   when I was reading it that I thought was interesting
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.200]   was the reason why this shift
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.660]   from the beginning of your life
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.800]   to the second half of your life
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.000]   seemed to be somewhat linked
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.880]   to the type of intelligence we have
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.820]   and how that changes over time.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.000]   And it's something that I think most people here
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.080]   probably haven't heard about.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.920]   So you talked about fluid and crystallized intelligence.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.160]   Can you walk through that for people who aren't familiar?
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.120]   - This book basically has the seven habits
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.360]   of people who get happier as they age.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   And one thing to keep in mind that's really important
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.720]   that I found over the course of my research
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.140]   is that there's a lot of similarity
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.880]   in the patterns of happiness
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.000]   over the first part of their life.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   So generally speaking, adults,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.480]   they kind of all pack together.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.560]   And the older you get, the more that people diverge.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.760]   And so you see that people after about 65
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.660]   go into two groups.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.120]   One gets happier and happier
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.200]   and the other gets less and less and less happy.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.800]   And the group that's getting less happy, paradoxically,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.280]   they tend to be the strivers
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.840]   who work the hardest early in their lives.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.400]   So you gotta look at that, that's a big mystery.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.040]   That doesn't mean it has to be that way.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.200]   But we need skills.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's why I have the seven skills
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.720]   that the happiest people later in life have
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   so that even if you are a striver, you're not doomed.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.560]   You just have to adopt these skills and do the work
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.800]   is what it comes down to.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.680]   Everybody who is getting the hacks needs the hacks.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.760]   And these are the seven hacks for all intents and purposes.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   That's the book, in a nutshell, that's the book.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Okay, now, what's the first skill?
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.940]   And the first skill is making sure
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.800]   that you've got, you're on the right success curve.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.380]   A little bit of background on this.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.560]   For about 100 years, psychologists have noticed
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.600]   that there's two types of geniuses.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.240]   There's early bloomers, early people
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.440]   who have an early appearance in their genius,
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720]   like child geniuses and young entrepreneurs.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.800]   And then you've got the late bloomers.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.060]   And so you think of that as like the Elon Musks
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.400]   and the Dalai Lamas.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.240]   Those are the two types of geniuses out there.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.320]   And one's really young and one's really old.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.160]   For the longest time, they thought,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.700]   well, two types of people.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.000]   They got the people who do this kind of thing
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.480]   and people who do this type of thing.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.920]   Well, later, we figured out everybody has both.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.400]   So that doesn't mean that I'm gonna be Elon Musk
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.060]   or the Dalai Lama, but I have a lot of power
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.600]   to actually use my potential to the max.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.900]   Early on, it's gonna be innovative capacity,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.720]   processing speed, indefatigability,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   my ability to go, go, go, go.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.920]   Later in life, it turns out that my abilities,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.460]   they migrate toward my wisdom.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.340]   My ability, not necessarily to work all night
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.000]   and solve problems that are brand new and innovative,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.120]   but to take existing knowledge, understand what it means,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.520]   combine ideas, and teach them.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   That's what you're really good at later in life.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.320]   Now, the first type of genius is called fluid intelligence.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   It increases naturally all the way through your 20s
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.900]   and through your early 30s, and it starts to decline
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.960]   in your late 30s and goes down really fast in your 40s.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   That's the reason that people are less likely
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.680]   to come up with some weird, big, eye-popping innovation
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.400]   when they're 50, much, much less so than when they're 30.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.840]   When you're 30, you're at maximum innovative capacity.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.400]   In your 40s, you're crystallized intelligence.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.680]   That's the second type, starts to increase,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.640]   which means that you get more wisdom.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.680]   You have more perspective.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.560]   You know more.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.840]   You have a good memory.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.700]   Your memory actually improves in a lot of ways,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.540]   believe it or not.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.760]   You can't recall Joe Smith's name.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   Who was that guy?
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.800]   You forget that, but you remember all the important things
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.080]   and you can combine them.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   It's like you have a vast library
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.680]   and you know how to use it, as a matter of fact.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.000]   One of the reasons that you forget stuff,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.760]   short-term memory, when you're older
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.620]   is because your library is so big
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.120]   that it takes time to go get a piece of information.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.200]   It's not degradation.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.080]   It's just the size of the library, basically,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   that the filing system is dense.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.140]   And so later on in life, this big library, people use it.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.120]   They become better Scrabble players.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.180]   They can actually be better at foreign languages,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.280]   even though their vocabulary's no good.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.600]   Their historians do half of their work, on average,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.240]   after age 65, because it's pure, crystallized intelligence.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.080]   It's this wisdom.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.000]   They're teachers.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.840]   And at my university, the best teachers,
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.280]   who get the best teaching evaluations,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.400]   are uniformly over 70 years old.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's crystallized intelligence.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.080]   So the key thing is, you gotta be on the right curve.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   If you're 50 or 60 years old, you're like,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.980]   "Ah, I'm struggling to keep up with the 30-year-olds."
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.380]   You're doomed, man.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.220]   You're doomed.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.600]   You're gonna feel horrible about yourself.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.440]   They're gonna run circles around you.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.360]   But here's what you need to do.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.120]   You need to school them with your wisdom.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.320]   This has so much potential for rockin' our world,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   because we basically, you're on the first curve,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.160]   and here's the thing.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.220]   If you wanna be happy and successful,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.560]   you gotta jump to the second curve.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.520]   You gotta go from the Elon Musk to the Dalai Lama.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.560]   You gotta go from the innovator to the instructor.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.160]   You might change jobs, you might not,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.720]   but you gotta retool your life
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.760]   and what you're paying attention to
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.440]   and what you're trying to do.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.560]   That's the first big skill
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.640]   of people who get happier as they age.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.160]   - And so if you're someone listening to this
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.040]   and you're like, "Okay, I'm in that late 20s,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.800]   "early 30s part of my life.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.620]   "I know I need to jump the curve eventually.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.880]   "What does that jump look like?
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.260]   "How do I prepare for it?
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.000]   "What should I be doing with my time?"
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.680]   - So to begin with, the tell, the big tell, the hack,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.200]   is that when you're starting to see the decline,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.800]   you're gonna see it before anybody else does.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.120]   So the big problem is if you deny it and rage against it,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.400]   and then people are like, "I don't know.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.540]   "Chris, he used to be a lot better than he is now.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.540]   "I don't know, he's starting to miss a beat.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.180]   "His questions used to be more lucid.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.320]   "He was coming up with better ideas than the old days."
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.400]   You don't wanna be that, but you're gonna notice
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.120]   that if you're starting to burn out a little bit,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.180]   you're starting to be a little less interested,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.340]   you're a little less inclined to stay up 16 hours
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.760]   to write all that code than you used to be.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.800]   The reason you want to do it less
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.300]   is because you're not as naturally good at it
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.320]   as you were before.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.560]   That's your tell.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.480]   Desire is not, I mean, ability is not the tell.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.800]   Desire is always the tell.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.880]   This is a thing that people don't quite understand.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.140]   Your desire tells all always.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.920]   What you like always indicates what your capacities are.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.760]   And so when you're first starting,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.680]   it's like, "I don't know, man."
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.520]   It's like this guy came to me with this great new
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.720]   startup idea, but I like, "Ah, I don't have a fire
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.600]   "in the belly anymore."
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   That's good.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.840]   That's a good sign.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.200]   That means that you're actually in liminality.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.140]   You're between the curves is actually what that means.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.640]   Okay, so what do you need to do?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   You need to learn and you need to actually
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.800]   start combining knowledge.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.480]   Instead of writing the book that has the big new
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.680]   mathematical treatise that nobody's ever come up
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.340]   with before, you write the book that combines
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.940]   everybody's best idea and says,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.500]   "You know the story behind all this that's all together?"
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.480]   That's the different kind of thing
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.600]   that you're trying to do.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.740]   Start learning about synthesis of things
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.280]   as opposed to the creation of brand new ideas.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.760]   Synthesize things as opposed to inventing things.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.520]   And that means different things in different professions.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.660]   If you're a lawyer, that means what you should do
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.640]   is you should start running a team of young lawyers.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.520]   You should actually find these unbelievably fluid,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.720]   intelligent workhorses and link them together
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.780]   for their success.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.200]   You should go from a cowboy to a team leader.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.560]   That's a really good way to do it.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.920]   If you're gonna be an entrepreneur,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.780]   don't come up with a big innovation.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.160]   Find people who can and make them successful.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.640]   That's the reason that great athletes
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.620]   who are unbelievable early in their careers,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.680]   they're really, really good as commentators on TV.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.060]   It's not just because their knees have gone out.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.080]   It's the same reason that entrepreneurs
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   who are unbelievably successful can be graded VC later.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.960]   Because what they are is actually teachers.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.760]   They're finding the next big talent.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.600]   They're cultivating the next big talent.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.840]   And every profession has something like this.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.380]   - Are there people that kind of are household names
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.240]   of whether they're famous writers or musicians
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.280]   that kind of have either done this well or poorly
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.200]   that kind of bring the example to life?
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.640]   Some are living and so I don't wanna talk about it,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.080]   but some who have done it poorly.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   But there are a lot of historical figures
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.220]   that have done it poorly and well.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.360]   And so in the book, for example,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.940]   I talk about Charles Darwin.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.440]   Charles Darwin is on everybody's list
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.600]   of greatest scientists.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.160]   If you've got a list of five greatest scientists
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.800]   in the past 500 years and Charles Darwin
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.760]   is not on your list, you're not serious.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.280]   I mean, he changed the way that we think
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.720]   with his theory of natural selection,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.160]   the theory of evolution, unbelievable.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.780]   Well, he came up with that at age 27
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.080]   when he came back from his around the world voyage
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.420]   on the Beagle collecting botanical and zoological samples.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.360]   And he was the most, from his late 20s,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.920]   he was already the most celebrated scientist in Europe.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.560]   He was rich, he was, he was the king of the mambo, man.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.960]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.440]   And he dined out on these theories for the next 30 years.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.760]   He just developed them and he nurtured them
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   and he used this big innovation.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.320]   He was the equivalent of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.800]   when he was 27 and then he was like
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.880]   the equivalent of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.260]   developing the company over the next 30 years.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.620]   Now, the problem was he got stuck
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.980]   when he was about 50 years old
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.880]   because he hadn't been a very motivated student.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.240]   So he didn't learn very much math
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.160]   or statistics, he didn't learn German.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.600]   And if you were gonna be a serious scientist,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.000]   you needed to know German in the late 19th century.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.080]   So what happened was that his own field
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.920]   passed him by mathematically.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.800]   There's a Czech priest and scientist named Gregor Mendel
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.840]   who actually was more mathematically sophisticated
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.340]   and he invented the theory of genetics.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.680]   And that's what Charles Darwin needed to progress
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.840]   in his own field and he couldn't understand it,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.520]   couldn't read it and got stuck.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   And from the age of 50 until he died at 73,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.880]   he never did very original work ever again.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.040]   He wrote 11 more books but he hated them all.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.800]   He's like, "Ugh, same old, same old, same old, same old."
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.960]   He's very depressed.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.860]   He died feeling like a disappointment.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.700]   Why?
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.480]   He was stuck on his first curve, Chris.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.040]   He was on his fluid intelligence curve.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.760]   He couldn't get off, he was like chained on it
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.440]   and he was like dragging him down to the basement.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.520]   And so at the end of his life, he's like,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.120]   "I don't have any motivation to do the things that I love.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.640]   "I can't start a new project.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.600]   "I don't know what's going on."
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.360]   He felt horrible about himself.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.720]   Okay, so it doesn't have to be that way
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.120]   'cause he could have jumped onto the second curve
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.000]   but he didn't know it existed or he didn't want to do that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.180]   That's the mistake.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.800]   Okay, let's get a better case study
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.320]   of somebody who did it right.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.800]   Johann Sebastian Bach,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.400]   the greatest composer who ever lived.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.100]   According to a lot of people, including me,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.840]   I made the first 12 years of my career
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.880]   as a classical musician and Bach's my favorite composer.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.080]   You know, he was unbelievable.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.400]   He was the innovator of the High Baroque.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.160]   He was inventing stuff that people just,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.400]   mind-blowing stuff when he was in his 20s.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.960]   He was, you know, princes were seeking him out
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.240]   to give him commissions.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.520]   He was celebrated all over Germany.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.560]   I mean, he was just unbelievable.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.740]   He was so famous, he was so great.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.520]   And then music passed him by.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.560]   At the age of 50, about the age of 50, same as Darwin,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.760]   his son, he had 20 kids by the way,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.560]   so that guy was productive.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.880]   His son, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach,
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.720]   invented a new style of music called the classical style
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.800]   and Bach, the father, couldn't keep up.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.220]   He's like, "I can't write in this style.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.320]   "I don't know how to write in this style."
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.980]   He couldn't keep up because his fluid intelligence
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.720]   was too low for him actually to keep up
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   with the innovations of the time.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.400]   So what did he do?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   He retooled his career as a teacher.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.680]   He turned from writing original pieces of music
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.040]   to writing textbooks about the High Baroque.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.680]   He went from doing commissions
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.840]   for the greatest pieces of music
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.260]   to writing music for the church
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.940]   as part of his teaching responsibilities.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.560]   And he became the most beloved teacher of his time.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.120]   He actually went from, what was he doing?
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.520]   He was jumping onto his crystallized intelligence curve.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.520]   He had a studio full of students who adored him.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.000]   He was known as a truly great teacher.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.680]   He was working on this textbook called the Art of Fugue,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.600]   which is all this High Baroque stuff
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.280]   nobody wanted to listen to anymore.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.560]   He literally died mid-measure
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.160]   while writing one of the fugues.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.800]   Today, a hundred years later,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   a famous composer named Felix Mendelssohn
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.880]   found his manuscript.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.960]   He's like, "Dude, you gotta hear this," to his friends.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   And they play it.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.620]   They're like, "This is beautiful.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.560]   "Today we play that textbook as a work of art."
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.760]   It'd be like reading a textbook like it's literature.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.980]   That's how great it is.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.820]   He didn't know that.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.580]   He just thought he was writing it down for posterity
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.240]   because he became a great teacher.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.080]   He died with his kids surrounding him
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.280]   and his students surrounding him
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.720]   and his grandkids surrounding him,
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.040]   and he died with love and happiness on his success curve.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.680]   By the way, on his better success curve,
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.900]   because dying happy is a good way to die.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.600]   - Yeah, so he definitely nailed skill number one.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.440]   - And two.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.280]   - Okay.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.100]   - He nailed it, man.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.940]   He nailed it.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.400]   And he was a living proof that everybody's got both,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.240]   but you gotta jump when it's time to jump.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.400]   You gotta have faith that it exists,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.680]   and you gotta have courage to make the change.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.480]   - And then what?
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.440]   Well, you said you got a handful of these skills
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.280]   that you have to master.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.100]   - Yeah.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.940]   - What's next?
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.640]   - So the key thing, the skills you gotta master next
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.840]   are the things that make you not wanna jump
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.000]   and then the things that make it easier.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.240]   So one of the key things you find about people
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.940]   who are really unhappy and actually can't get happier,
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.800]   they wind up going downward in their happiness
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.560]   and stuck on this fluid intelligence curve
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.440]   and thinking about the past and kind of pissed off
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.640]   because I'm not appreciated anymore
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.360]   and trying to hide their weaknesses and all that,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.260]   they have a really bad and nasty addiction,
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.000]   which is something that a lot of people suffer from.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.820]   It's a success addiction.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.200]   Now, all addictions, they implicate a neuromodulator
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.600]   in the brain called dopamine.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.560]   Most everybody who listens to this podcast
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.960]   knows about dopamine.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.200]   Dopamine is the neurotransmitter of reward.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.400]   It's of anticipation.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.920]   It's like, I want it, I want it.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   This is what gets you addicted to alcohol
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.520]   or cigarettes or gambling or methamphetamine.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.800]   It's the dopamine that makes you want it, want it, want it.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.060]   It gives you a mild burst of satisfaction
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.720]   and then it goes away and you want it again,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.980]   hit the lever again.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.600]   We're like monkeys on cocaine,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.300]   where we lose our sense of proportion.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.760]   We lose our sense of inhibition.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.560]   We hit the lever, hit the lever, hit the lever
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.880]   again and again and again.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.600]   Addiction's bad because dopamine can chain us.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.280]   The worst kind of addiction that I see
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.680]   for really, really successful people,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.920]   I mean, some drink too much, some smoke.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.840]   They shouldn't.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.560]   They're not usually gambling addicts
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.840]   and most of them are not foolish enough
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.760]   to get addicted to really, really bad narcotics,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.560]   but they're success addicts.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.680]   You know what a lot of really,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.840]   you know, the ambitious people you and I know,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.660]   from a young age, their parents are like,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.140]   you're special, you're a hard worker,
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.420]   you get A's, you always win.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.600]   That's what their parents are telling them
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.040]   and they objectify their kids
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.600]   and the kids objectify themselves as homo economicus,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.280]   as the victorious one, as the successful one
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.880]   and they get the cookie of success
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.020]   and they hit the lever, they get the promotion,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.300]   they get the extra money, they get the adulation,
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   they get the compliments and they love it.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.800]   It gives, literally, it stimulates dopamine in their brain
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.860]   and so they hit the lever, hit the lever, hit the lever
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.980]   and when they're getting better
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.320]   on their fluid intelligence curve,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.760]   man, it's like flying with terrifying speed.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.380]   It's like the monkey in front of the lever
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.640]   hitting the lever again and again and again and again
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.240]   and then, when the hits come less frequently,
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.600]   it's misery, it's a dysphoria.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.960]   It's literally a scarcity of dopamine in the brain
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.320]   and so they chase it, chase it, chase it, chase it
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.480]   and this is one of the things that distracts them
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.560]   from the evolution of their own strengths.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.640]   It makes them unable.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.000]   It's addiction makes them unable to pursue happiness.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   - And so what's the answer there?
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.480]   I think, you know, I live in Silicon Valley.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.080]   So often, everyone's like, you know,
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.520]   you gotta find your purpose.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.980]   Whatever you're working on, it could be bigger.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.400]   You could be doing more.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.640]   You know, I juxtapose that to most of the happy people
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.600]   or most of the people who I know
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.400]   who aren't obsessed with that
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.480]   seem much happier in their lives,
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   yet it's still something that even knowing that,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.680]   so many people chase.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.000]   - Yeah, so that's, hustle culture is a cult
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.240]   and it's a cult called workism
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   where your work is your identity,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.000]   your work is your fulfillment,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.220]   your work is your ego, your work is everything
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.440]   and your work is your pleasure
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.000]   because of your success addiction, you're hitting the lever.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.820]   The main thing that we need to do
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.720]   is to establish what we call metacognition.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.920]   Metacognition is very simple.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.520]   The Buddhists always say when you have feelings and urges,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.960]   you need to observe those feelings and urges.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.080]   Now, literally what's going on neurophysiologically
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.500]   is that an urge or a feeling originates
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.880]   in the limbic system of the brain.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.120]   That's the lizard brain.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.800]   That's the back part of your brain
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.960]   that is stimulated automatically
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.720]   because of outside happenings.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.480]   What you wanna do, you'll be managed by that.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.620]   If you're reactive and you're simply hitting the lever,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.920]   if you're a cocaine monkey, you're just a limbic creature.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.760]   You're like my dog, Chucho.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.480]   My dog, Chucho, he's like,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.080]   he sees the cookie, eats the cookie.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.880]   He's highly mindful.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.360]   He's not paying any positive attention
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.160]   or spending any time thinking about anything.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.760]   He's like, "Cookie, eat the cookie."
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.700]   That's how a lot of people are
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.840]   who are deeply, deeply workist in that cult.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.680]   The way to defeat that is by simply journaling
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.480]   and thinking and putting time
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.440]   between your impulses and your actions.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.920]   You know, the Buddhists always say
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.700]   the time between action and reaction
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.940]   is the humanity in what we do.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.080]   It's the true humanness in what we do.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.940]   What's really going on here is you're moving an urge
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.440]   from your limbic system of your brain
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.120]   to your prefrontal cortex.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.400]   That's the human part of your brain,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.840]   the big meaty lobes behind your forehead.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.720]   Once it's there, you can manage it.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.500]   To be metacognitive is to say,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.320]   okay, I have the urge to be successful.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.560]   I feel like I'm gonna be unhappy unless I'm successful,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.080]   and yet I'm not happy.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.600]   You need to start journaling.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   That's the bottom line.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.760]   The reason, journaling, it sounds sort of wimpy
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.040]   and weak and kind of dumb and sentimental.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.200]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.800]   This is highly neuroscientific.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.260]   Journaling is the single best way
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.740]   to go from my dog Chucho to me, to my prefrontal cortex.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.620]   It moves your urges into the front part of your brain,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.680]   and then you can manage them.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.180]   That's the single best technique
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.380]   for breaking these addictions,
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.360]   is thinking about them metacognitively.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.560]   - So many people I know that are big advocates of journaling,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.760]   you know, it becomes a thing where they are,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.640]   okay, every day I wake up and I journal in the morning,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.520]   and maybe I also journal in bed.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.080]   Do you need to journal that often
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.800]   to benefit from journaling?
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.960]   - Different people need to figure out
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.440]   what their own rhythm of that is.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.280]   I actually do recommend writing down
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.820]   a few thoughts every day.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.080]   I don't think that actually spending
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.760]   half an hour in the morning, half an hour at noon,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.120]   half an hour at night is probably
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.400]   a really great use of your time,
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   unless you're trying to write your memoir,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.400]   which would be like the most narcissistic
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.520]   millennial thing ever, right?
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.580]   It's almost like a cartoon of what everybody thinks.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.240]   That's not what I'm talking about at all.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.160]   I think it's really, really important, however,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   to make sure that you record what you're doing.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.880]   Now, some people don't have to do this
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.960]   in terms of journaling.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   One of the great things about heavily,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.920]   about very, very functioning romantic partnerships
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.160]   is that you can be jointly metacognitive,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.480]   but you have to work every day
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.600]   to be talking about what's happening to you limbically,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.360]   to discuss your feelings with each other,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.080]   and to discuss, so, for example,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.560]   when I'm feeling workist, and it's really my tendency,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.760]   I mean, I've taken my career down to the studs four times.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.140]   I'm on my fourth distinct career at this point,
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.320]   and so I know how to actually work a system,
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.800]   and I'm like, I mean, you're an entrepreneur.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.320]   You actually know how success works, right?
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.400]   But left to my devices, I'm cocaine monkey all day long,
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.920]   and when I feel these, and I'm unhappy when I'm doing it,
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.000]   and I know enough about that
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.560]   because I'm a pretty metacognitive, pretty self-aware guy,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.320]   I don't necessarily go and write in my journal.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.880]   What I do is I go and I talk to my wife.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.320]   I say, I got a problem.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.660]   I'm doing this thing again,
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.880]   and we jointly metacognitively,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.280]   we move it to the prefrontal cortex of my brain
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.760]   where I actually can manage it.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.360]   So having a partner with whom you can discuss these things
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.040]   with confidence is arguably
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.000]   an even more effective way to do this.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.780]   - So it's really, and it could be a partner,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.160]   your wife or your husband.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.960]   It could be a friend, I assume, or a mentor.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.280]   - It has to be somebody close.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.880]   It has to be somebody who actually understands you,
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.840]   who can do joint metacognition with you,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.000]   which is to say they really want to understand
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.600]   what's happening to you limbically,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.400]   and they wanna help you manage it as an executive.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.560]   So they can actually function
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.600]   as the third lobe of your brain for you in those moments,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.340]   and it has to be somebody who knows you deeply.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.200]   It can't be your subordinate at work.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.100]   That's not gonna work at all.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.540]   - I wanna come back to some of these other skills
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.660]   that you can learn,
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.660]   but you said something interesting when it was,
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.540]   okay, you could go to your partner.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.940]   There are things that I think
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.440]   often get construed with happiness,
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.900]   things like love or money.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.980]   Are there components of happiness?
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.780]   I know you talked about
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.840]   enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.440]   but some of the common things I think people think of,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.980]   I'm curious to get your perspective on them.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.820]   So let's at least include love or romance and money,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.060]   and maybe other common things people think
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.260]   are associated with happiness,
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.980]   and how do they fit into the picture?
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.900]   - So these things that people associate with them,
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.140]   sometimes they're idols and sometimes they're real.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.460]   So here's the way to think about that
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.560]   is in a very practical way.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.740]   There are four things that you want that are idols
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.420]   and that have a little bit of a divine quality to them.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.820]   They attract you, they're magnetic.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.740]   You know you want them,
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.180]   but they're not intrinsically satisfying.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.400]   Those things are money, power, pleasure, and fame.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.460]   Now, all those things are good.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.840]   All those things can be really good,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.940]   but only when you pursue them instrumentally
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.620]   towards something that's more important than those things.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.100]   Money's great, but if you pursue it for its own sake,
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.840]   it will leave you frustrated and empty.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.820]   Power is the same thing.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.020]   You'll become a tyrant.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.140]   Pleasure is incomplete because it's entirely limbic.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.740]   It'll make you a little bit more animal.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.500]   You need to actually combine it with elevation and morality
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.780]   and make it into enjoyment,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   which is one of the macronutrients of happiness.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.340]   And fame is literally the only idol that we pursue
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.180]   that you can only ever be happy in spite of.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.660]   Only ever in spite of.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.140]   It's super dangerous,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.500]   which is why social media is making us all so crazy today
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.700]   'cause everybody can establish a little bit of local fame
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.060]   and they get a lot of dopamine by seeing likes
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.460]   and ugh, it's awful.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.780]   Okay, so those are the evil four.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.220]   And they're not evil if we use them appropriately.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.900]   Like anything else, wine isn't evil
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.820]   until you become an alcoholic, et cetera.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.600]   So these things create addiction
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.140]   and they're instrumentally, they can be okay,
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.780]   but intrinsically, they're the bad four.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.740]   They're the idols.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.980]   There's the good four.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.940]   Now, here's what the four habits,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.380]   let's call this the four accounts
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.620]   that you need to invest in every day
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.740]   if you wanna be among the happiest people.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.740]   This is what they all have in common.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.380]   There's 10,000 articles of the habits
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.280]   of the happiest people.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.340]   I've boiled the ocean down to these basic four.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.980]   So this is not the habits of how to grow old happier.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.020]   Of all people, they all do these things every day.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.460]   They practice their faith or life philosophy.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.660]   You don't have to be religious.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.900]   You just have something bigger than you
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.620]   that zooms you out on your own life.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.460]   Why?
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.780]   Because your life is like the most boring sitcom ever
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.580]   with which you're obsessed.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.100]   My job, my car, my money, my ugh.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.300]   It's just so boring, right?
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.420]   And yet we're obsessed with it.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.700]   You need relief, you need peace.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.540]   Life philosophy or faith or spiritual practice
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.940]   gives you that uniquely.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.180]   So it's meditation or prayer or studying the Stoics
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.740]   or whatever it happens to be.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.260]   You gotta do your thing and you gotta do it seriously.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.300]   Second is family.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.600]   The ties that bind and don't break.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.580]   Now these are the bonds that it's important
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.900]   that you not choose them but that you have them
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.740]   for your happiness.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.820]   And God knows in many cases we wouldn't choose them,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.660]   right, Chris?
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.140]   I mean, a lot of our listeners are like,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.620]   yeah, I had a bad Thanksgiving without Marge
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.820]   who kept talking about Trump.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.220]   You know, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.940]   You know, it's like hate him or love him or whatever.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.780]   It's awful.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.980]   And a lot of people are having a lot of trouble
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.820]   with their families.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.780]   One in six Americans is not talking to a family member
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.140]   because of politics today.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.020]   It's a huge problem for happiness.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.860]   - Wow.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.820]   - I mean, unless it's a case of abuse,
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.540]   don't let that be you is the bottom line.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.740]   The third is friendship.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.660]   We have a major loneliness crisis in the United States.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.820]   Vivek Murthy, our Surgeon General, he was on my show
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.380]   and he said that the biggest public health crisis
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.960]   in America today is loneliness.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.500]   Not the coronavirus epidemic, not opioids,
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.260]   not guns, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.420]   Loneliness.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.720]   The average number of close friends
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.500]   that somebody 30 years old has has been cut in half
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.300]   in the past 20 years.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.180]   About half of people under 30 say
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.580]   that no one knows them well.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.700]   It's horrible for every aspect of happiness.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.460]   And part of the reason for that is that
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.740]   everybody knows how to make deal friends,
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.140]   but we know less and less how to make real friends.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.540]   And so in my book, I've got all of the sort of the details,
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.580]   you know, down to the basics on do this and do this
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.420]   and do this and do this.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.060]   And the book talks about how to make real friends
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.940]   if you're incompetent because you've only had deal friends.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.180]   And the last is work, is work.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.300]   And work doesn't mean working hard all night long.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.860]   It doesn't mean making tons of money.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.980]   It doesn't mean having prestige.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.860]   It means exactly two things, earning your success,
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.620]   meaning your skills meet your passions,
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.900]   and serving other people, the people who need you.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.700]   If you earn your success and you're serving other people,
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.620]   I don't care if you're an electrician or a librarian
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.320]   or a podcast host or a Harvard professor,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.460]   you will be happy from your work.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.940]   And if you don't have those things,
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.420]   you won't be happy from your work.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.540]   Faith, family, friends, and work are the big four
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.980]   are the things that we need to shoot for.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.340]   And the things we need to avoid as intrinsics
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.180]   are money, power, pleasure, and fame.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.840]   - There's a book called "Happy Money,"
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.900]   which talks about using money for happiness.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.500]   And one of the interesting things they say is,
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.940]   you know, spending money on others
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.660]   is actually one of the five ways they identify,
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.400]   you know, can make you happy.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.000]   That seems to fit a little bit in work,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.140]   but is it important to share happiness,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.060]   to spread happiness, to give happiness
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.780]   in order to be happy ourselves?
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.980]   - The way to get happier, there's an algorithm to it,
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.700]   believe it or not, to get happier.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.500]   And this is, obviously, this is really down to brass tacks,
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.940]   but a lot of people wish they were happier, but they're not.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.100]   They're just obsessing on their unhappiness.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.660]   But like anything else, it's like, you gotta do the work.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.980]   You know, if you said, "Hey, Chris," you're like,
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.460]   "Hey, man, I wish I knew more math."
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.540]   I was like, get a book, you know,
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.300]   that's, you don't wish you knew calculus,
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.680]   you study calculus.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.940]   And the same thing is true with happiness
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.420]   or any other skill, it's an actual life skill.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.740]   And there's three steps to it.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.900]   You need to understand it by doing the work and study it,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.260]   learn what the practices are.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.220]   Now, you can do it by talking to your grandmother,
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.940]   or you can do it by reading my column,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.500]   you can do it by lots and lots of ways,
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.780]   but you gotta do the work.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.300]   The second is you gotta practice it, you gotta apply it.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.100]   You can't read just a book about golf
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.060]   and become a better golfer.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.380]   You gotta get out there and golf.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.180]   And so you need to take the applications
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.420]   that all of us in this field are talking about
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.720]   and practice them in your life.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   Do your gratitude list, do your forgiveness exercise,
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.900]   do your happiness strategic plan.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.260]   I have millions of exercises that I give to my students
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.600]   that I publish in my columns,
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.300]   but you gotta do the application,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.580]   and then you gotta share it.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.980]   This is the most beautiful thing of all, why?
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   Because you gotta make it metacognitive.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.620]   It's what we were talking about a minute ago.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.460]   The best way to make something metacognitive
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.700]   is to teach it, why?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.680]   Because you can't teach something limbically,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.940]   you can only teach something
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.360]   from the executive center of your brain
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.020]   because you have to be able to articulate the idea.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.640]   And so if you wanna get happier,
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.580]   you really have to understand it and manage it.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.800]   And the best way to do it is to teach it.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.860]   And teaching is just another form of sharing.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.120]   So understand, apply, share.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.720]   That's your happiness algorithm.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.200]   - And is sharing more telling people
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.680]   about how they can be happy
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.180]   or trying to make people happy?
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.780]   - Well, ordinarily it's both,
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.680]   but I actually strongly recommend showing your cards.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.600]   So one of the ways that my students,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.440]   and I've got this class,
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.680]   I got 180 MBA students in my happiness class.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.060]   And like 400 on the waiting list.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.060]   I mean, it's like a lot of people
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.920]   wanna get into this class.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.160]   And so I say one of the ways
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.520]   they can get final credit for the class,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.760]   instead of writing the exam,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   they can set up their own happiness class
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.400]   for students who didn't get in.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.240]   And so what do they do?
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.800]   They take my PowerPoint slides,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.900]   they take my name off, they put their name on.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.240]   They put together their own syllabus
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.400]   and they videotape the class
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.140]   as they turn the whole thing in.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.680]   What am I doing?
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.520]   And they're becoming totally metacognitive
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.720]   in everything that we've talked about.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.800]   They will never forget these technologies
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.880]   once they teach them.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.200]   So here's the great thing about happiness.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.560]   The most beautiful thing.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.480]   People are listening to us
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.540]   and they're getting a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.360]   Maybe they're gonna listen to us twice or three times
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.200]   and they're gonna take notes
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.800]   because we're covering so much material so fast.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.180]   Enjoyment, satisfaction, pleasure,
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.560]   money, power, pleasure, honor,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.600]   faith, family, friends, and work.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.920]   I mean, it's like list, list, list, list, right?
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.620]   Write it all down, make your slides,
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.880]   discuss it at dinner.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.320]   I mean, or talk about it and say,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.160]   basically, I heard Chris Hutchins' podcast,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.000]   which I love because it's a great podcast.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.240]   And he had this guy who teaches at Harvard
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   talking about the science of happiness.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.040]   Here's the thing he said.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.720]   I guarantee you, there will not be a peep.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   People are gonna be listening to you
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.080]   as if you were the Dalai Lama
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   if you talk about this stuff
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.920]   'cause everybody wants it, you know?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.360]   It's great to be a happiness professor
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.400]   because it, you know,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.920]   suffice it to say that it piques people's interest.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I love episodes like this.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.120]   Sometimes we talk about money
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.840]   and I know people aren't gonna go home
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.160]   and meet up with their friends at night
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.260]   and be like, so, you know, what's in your bank account?
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.960]   (laughing)
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.160]   You know, maybe some of our listeners
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.880]   are more excited about investing,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.560]   but when it comes to the deeply personal side of money,
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.400]   it doesn't get spread.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.600]   - I know, hey, a dinner conversation, blockchain.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.520]   Yeah, ugh, shoot me.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.960]   - Wow, you don't live in Silicon Valley.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.360]   - I know, I know, I know.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.680]   Hey, I'm a math guy too.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.840]   So yeah, but still, I wanna be happy.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.160]   - Yeah, so the other one that you just mentioned
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.960]   in the good for that I think I wanna spend a minute on
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.800]   is with faith.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.000]   So you mentioned that it's not just organized religion,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.080]   but I think so often someone might listen to this
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.400]   and think those two must be the same thing.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.920]   It's not for me, I'm kind of scared of this,
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.160]   but I hear it and I'm like, gosh,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.680]   you're telling me that the people that are the happiest
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.960]   have these four things.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.880]   How does someone who's maybe organized religion
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.040]   isn't a part of their life,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.320]   but wants to bring faith into their life
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.040]   in the happiness sense,
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.640]   how would someone get started with that?
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.360]   - There are lots and lots of ways to do that.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.920]   And so the two ways that I recommend
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.900]   if you're uncomfortable with traditional religion
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.000]   and or prayer,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.800]   I recommend that you start a secular meditation practice
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   because meditation is highly concentrating.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.880]   It actually will bring you to mindfulness
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.800]   and at the same time can zoom you out
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.440]   on the experience of your own life.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.160]   So it's weirdly, it concentrates you
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.280]   on the experience of your own life
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.660]   and it zooms you out on the experience
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.880]   of your own life simultaneously.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   It's a very, very effective practice for doing that.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.520]   And it's also extremely satisfying
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.120]   and it can help you to rebalance your hormone profile,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.320]   all kinds of good stuff.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.840]   I mean, all kinds of good physiology behind it.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.160]   And the second thing is actually
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.220]   is reading a lot more big ideas.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.920]   Like start with the Brothers Karamazov.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.100]   Why?
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.180]   Because this is a study in human transcendence.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.580]   That's really what it is.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.100]   Read "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.940]   Read "The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius."
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.260]   Read "The Miracle of Mindfulness" by Thich Nhat Hanh.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.500]   All of these things are hugely available to us
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.920]   and they'll blow your mind.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.580]   If you're doing half an hour a day
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.620]   of that deep wisdom reading,
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.140]   you just won't be the same.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.100]   You won't be the same.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.700]   Now, at some point, you might want to experiment
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.860]   with the religion of your youth
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.300]   because that stuff is unbelievable.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.200]   I mean, it's like, it's so incredible.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.620]   I'm a Catholic and, but you know,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.140]   the Catholic philosopher, St. Thomas Aquinas,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.900]   he's the reason that we read Aristotle today.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.180]   You read St. Thomas Aquinas, you're like,
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.740]   "Oh, before him, nobody read Aristotle.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.500]   "Aristotle was lost."
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.460]   And he said, "No, no, no.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.140]   "Hey guys, this is the best thing ever."
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.440]   And you understand Aristotle in this brand new way.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.500]   Whether you're religious or not, Aquinas is incredible.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.820]   Read the Confessions of St. Augustine.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.580]   It's just amazing, a study in human psychology
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.660]   about the stirrings of the human heart.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.580]   This stuff is so good.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.020]   By the way, even if you're not,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.860]   completely not religious at all, read the Bible.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.620]   You're not actually a very cultured person
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.500]   if you've never read the Bible
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.620]   because it's the most culturally inflecting
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.420]   and impactful book ever written.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.380]   So just to understand what's going on in society,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.540]   it's a good idea to write,
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.780]   to read the most impactful book
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.140]   that's ever been read in society.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.260]   Believe it or don't believe it,
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.620]   you can actually think that God was behind the writing of it
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.020]   or not behind the writing of it.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.300]   It's just, your mind will be blown.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.260]   It'll just be completely that,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.860]   you'll experience day-to-day life
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.300]   in a completely different way.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.700]   And that's really what it's all about
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.460]   because you need relief from the reality show
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.300]   of Chris Hutchins' life.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.980]   - And does that mean that practicing faith
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.860]   could just be reading these deep ideas?
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.500]   Like that is actually a method for that.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.940]   - Yeah, what I recommend is reading them,
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.300]   but reading them in a very, very deep way.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.660]   So when I talk about reading something,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.100]   some of the people listening to us are,
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.340]   I'm a really, really slow and very poor reader,
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.340]   but a lot of the people who are listening to us
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.700]   are really fast readers.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.180]   My son, my oldest son is 23 years old.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   I mean, it's like he can read literally three times
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.460]   as fast as I can.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.460]   Slow down and read two pages.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.020]   Underline those two pages and take notes
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.900]   and then take 15 minutes and think deeply
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.420]   about what those ideas mean in the context
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.020]   of your day-to-day life.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.380]   That's what the ancient philosophers called
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.220]   Lectio Divina, divine reading.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.500]   In other words, it's to let the reading ideas
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.180]   seep into your soul.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.340]   And it's a very powerful cognitive technique
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   for reading in such a way
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.980]   that it really will change your perspective.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.580]   So yeah, I just read "Man's Search for Meaning" today.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.980]   It's like, no, you didn't.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.100]   No, you didn't.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.100]   It's like, I read the writings of Seneca this week.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   It's like, get out of here, you didn't.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.340]   You read one page and then we'll talk
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.420]   because it's so full of wisdom.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.780]   I wanna see the underlined.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.020]   I wanna see the highlighting.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.420]   I wanna see your notes.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.540]   And then I want you to tell me what that actually did
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.940]   to change your way of thinking
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.580]   and your change your way of behaving today.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.020]   That's Lectio Divina.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.100]   - Wow.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.340]   Yeah, it's not audible at 2X.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.180]   - You know, that is so Silicon Valley, man.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.980]   That is so absolutely true
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.900]   is that I'm reading to harvest information
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.580]   so that I can use it for money, power, pleasure, and fame.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.540]   Hugely problematic.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.780]   - We got way off track.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.020]   And I think if we were to try to come back,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.940]   the next thing that's kind of a skill
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.020]   that you would talk about
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.580]   would be about using the science of satisfaction.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.020]   Am I bringing us to the right place?
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.860]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.060]   The science of satisfaction is some of these boys
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.580]   that ever rocked my world.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.740]   The science of satisfaction really is back to dopamine.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.020]   You know, it's the success addict
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.460]   is the one who keeps hitting the lever
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.740]   because they think they're gonna get satisfaction.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.500]   And Mick Jagger sang, "I Don't Get No Satisfaction,"
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.860]   which is a super famous song.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.140]   It's the third most popular rock and roll song of all time.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.180]   It became a number one hit when I was one.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.220]   And Mick Jagger is still singing it.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.820]   And I'm not a spring chicken.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.700]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.820]   So, and why is it?
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.700]   It's not a great song.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.140]   The reason is because it has a message
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.300]   that people can really relate to.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.780]   I try and I try and I try and consumer culture and sex
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.020]   and all that, but I can't get no satisfaction.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.980]   The truth is you can get satisfaction,
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.620]   but you can't keep no satisfaction
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.220]   because dopamine won't let you.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.620]   Here's the concept for the moment for, you know,
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.100]   every five minutes we cycle through
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.500]   some really heavy thing here on this.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.980]   I love this conversation, by the way.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.180]   You're, you know, you're fast, man.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.540]   So the concept is homeostasis.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.420]   Homeostasis is the natural tendency of the brain
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.820]   to return all physical and mental processes to equilibrium.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   So for example, you get on the treadmill in the morning
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.140]   and you're running and you're,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.620]   to get your heart rate up to 160,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.980]   you step off 15 minutes later,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.420]   your heart rate is back down to what it's supposed to be,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.540]   like 80 or 70 or whatever it happens to be.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.780]   If it didn't, you'd die.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.620]   Homeostasis returns you to baseline.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.260]   It also returns you emotionally to baseline.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.860]   Something really great happens to you.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.740]   Your book is a bestseller, congratulations.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.020]   One week from now, you're not gonna feel a thing.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.860]   Why?
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.500]   Because you can't stay on that high forever, you'd die.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.780]   You wouldn't, in ancient times, you'd be like,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.740]   I found some tasty berries on a bush
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.980]   and I'm gonna be permanently happy
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.820]   while the saber-toothed tiger sneaks up behind you
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.340]   and eats you for lunch.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.860]   You need to have emotions to guide your behavior,
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.100]   but you gotta go back to the baseline
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.440]   to be ready for the next set of circumstances.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.740]   That's the reason you can't keep satisfaction in life.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.260]   You hit the lever and you think it'll stay forever
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.980]   and it doesn't, it stays for a minute or a day
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.280]   or if it's something really, really great,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.740]   a week or a month, you got into Harvard, congratulations.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.540]   One month from now, you're gonna be bummed out
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.040]   'cause your girlfriend broke up with you,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.380]   whatever it happens to be.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.620]   So the science of satisfaction says you can't keep it
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.940]   and so therefore, you shouldn't tie your bliss
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.060]   to the idea that you can by running
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.540]   from thing to thing to thing.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.920]   And the happiest old people have got this figured out.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.200]   The happiest old people are no longer chained
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.420]   to the happiness wheel.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.680]   We call it the hedonic treadmill
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.600]   where you run and run and run.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.700]   The thing is running against you
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.080]   and there's a little evil guy in the corner
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.580]   turning up the speed.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.260]   And after a while, you're running out of fear
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.700]   because if you stop on a treadmill,
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.780]   boom, face plant, right?
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.140]   This is the very important thing that old people figure out
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.060]   and they step off the hedonic treadmill.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.420]   - Is the hedonic treadmill similar to the concept
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.820]   of keeping up with the Joneses
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.540]   in kind of maybe our financial or cultural lives?
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.380]   - It's related.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.980]   That's actually a phenomenon called social comparison
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.580]   and social comparison, you know,
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.740]   the great philosopher, President Theodore Roosevelt
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.900]   called social comparison, the thief of joy.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.220]   Unambiguously, social comparison
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.700]   will wipe out your happiness.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.300]   It will mow down your joy.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.820]   That's the reason that social media is a misery machine.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.880]   It gives you none of the stuff that you seek,
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.900]   which is, you know, affirmation,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.860]   more than a little tiny moment on the hedonic treadmill,
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.500]   but it's based on social comparison
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.220]   and you're getting a fake version of somebody else's life,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.060]   which you're comparing to the terrible version
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.160]   of your own life.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.820]   Meanwhile, you're posting a fake version of your life.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.180]   I mean, you don't post, hey, my wife just screamed at me.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.860]   My kid just flunked math.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.580]   You don't put that on social media, right?
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.820]   It's like, no, beautiful day, love being alive,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.180]   going for a hike, seeing Paris, right?
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.060]   BS, that's not right.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.300]   And so the result of it is it's all fake,
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.580]   fictional social comparison and it makes you miserable.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.840]   So the hedonic treadmill is bad enough.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.100]   Lard on social comparison on top of that
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.040]   and misery is in the future.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   - One of the things you just said,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.400]   you said people when they're old that are the most happy
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.160]   have gotten off the treadmill.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.840]   And I know you have a lot of opinions on bucket lists.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.980]   So I wanna bring up something.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   I interviewed a guy named Ben Nemton a few months ago
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   who has written a lot about bucket lists
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.180]   and his inspiration was talking or reading research
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.380]   of people who on their deathbed said one of their regrets
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.660]   was not living the life they wanted to.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.100]   And he has through plenty of conversations
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.580]   kind of come to the conclusion that part of the reason
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.240]   people don't do the things they want
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.740]   is because they never take the time to write it down,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.500]   write down how they wanna get there.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.580]   And life just gets in the way
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.140]   so they don't do the things they care about.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.900]   And so his answer was I think people should create a list,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.200]   not just of bungee jump in New Zealand,
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.740]   but things in their life, in their relationships,
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.380]   in their family, with their health
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.420]   and write it down as a bucket list.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.100]   And I know you have some strong opinions about bucket lists.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.500]   So I'd love to hear your perspective on all that.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.660]   - There's a lot that's right that you just said,
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.180]   but we have to be really careful.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.660]   Bucket lists as we usually understand them
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.100]   are metastatically stupid and misery provoking.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.100]   What are they usually?
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.180]   It's like, I wanna go on a hot air balloon.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.500]   That's the average, by the way,
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.100]   that is the seventh most popular bucket list item
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.860]   in America today, hot air balloons.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.700]   Who knew?
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.520]   Who cares?
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.860]   Hot air balloon, whatever, different strokes, right?
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.340]   But I wanna make a million dollars.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.180]   I wanna publish a self-help book.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.820]   I wanna, people have these,
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.140]   basically money, power, pleasure, honor bucket list items.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.700]   Those are bad for you
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.980]   because what they do is they lower your satisfaction.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.380]   They increase your attachment.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.180]   They increase your craving and it grows around you
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.860]   like kudzu and it lowers your satisfaction.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.820]   Here's the key thing to keep in mind, Chris.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.460]   Your satisfaction is not a function of what you have.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.900]   Your satisfaction is a function of what you have
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.960]   divided by what you want.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.260]   Your have's divided by your wants.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.540]   Don't have a have's management strategy
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.760]   with a bunch of trivial bucket list items.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.620]   Have a wants management strategy
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.920]   of decreasing your worldly wants
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.820]   and your satisfaction will grow.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.920]   That's the reverse bucket list.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.240]   The reverse bucket list is to make it a list
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.040]   of all of the kind of tacky cravings.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.820]   I want the admiration of these strangers
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.700]   and I want this kind of car
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.560]   and I want this glamorous vacation.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.540]   Write it all down.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.700]   Great, write it all down.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.360]   And then say, I detach myself from this.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.200]   I no longer care.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.240]   I officially no longer care about this.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.740]   The right thing in the bucket list
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:28.580]   that you're talking about
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.220]   that actually makes a lot of sense
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.980]   is making a list of the good four, money, power,
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.540]   I'm sorry, faith, family, friends, and work.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.420]   Faith, family, friends, and work that serve other people.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.320]   Make a bucket list of those things,
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.540]   of the love that I want to have,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.700]   the relationship I want to have with my adult children,
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.340]   the relationship I want to establish with my parents
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.100]   and learn about them before they die.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.900]   Those are family items, for example.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.640]   The deep friendships that I want to migrate
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.540]   all my deal friends to real friends
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.060]   'cause this is one of the great sources
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.780]   of unhappiness and loneliness,
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.860]   especially in Silicon Valley.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.580]   It's like tons of deal friends, not so many real friends.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.820]   That's a bucket list item is real friends.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.440]   That's actually meritorious.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.780]   It's actually seeing how I can do work
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.400]   that truly serves other people who need me.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.600]   I want to go on a spiritual journey.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.660]   That's a bucket list item that's really meritorious.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.580]   So those are the things
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.140]   that actually should stay in the bucket
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.780]   and everything else should come right out.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.180]   - So it's less about not having a bucket list
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.380]   and more about calling it down
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.060]   to the things that will matter.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.620]   And then it sounds like you guys might,
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.040]   you and Ben at least would share
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.180]   that having them written down somewhere
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.540]   and talking about what you can do this week,
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.900]   this day to make progress towards them
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.540]   is a valuable exercise.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.100]   It's just not a valuable exercise
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.180]   if there's 300 things that include all kinds of crazy,
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.300]   I guess, wants.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.140]   - Yeah, yeah, no, sure.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.460]   Bunchy jumping in the Mekong Delta.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.280]   No, no.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.300]   Getting to know my father better.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.860]   Yes, yes.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.740]   That's actually right.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.100]   So I think that he and I would agree
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.900]   to a very, very large extent.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.580]   A bucket list is not a bucket list is not a bucket list.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.560]   If you're filling your life with unsatisfied trivialities,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.100]   all that's gonna happen is you're gonna wind up
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.940]   being less satisfied and unhappier than you were before.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.900]   - There's been a common conversation about experiences.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.300]   Like money should buy experiences
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.940]   'cause experiences is the way to fulfill yourself
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.900]   and be satisfied and be happy.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.780]   But I think a little bit of what you just said
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.980]   contradicts that concept.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.420]   - So there's a lot of research on this.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.340]   And I have two colleagues at the Harvard Business School,
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.620]   Ashley Williams and Mike Norton.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.220]   They're kind of the leading experts on how to buy happiness.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.300]   And there's basically, you can classify it in different ways.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.740]   Some people say five, some people say six.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.340]   There's really four things you can do with happiness.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   You can buy stuff, you can buy time,
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.700]   you can buy experiences, and you can give it away.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.440]   Those kind of the big four ways that you can use money.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.900]   Now, what everybody wants to do for their satisfaction
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.840]   is they wanna buy stuff
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.100]   because they think that's the most tangible.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:48.940]   But that's not right.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.760]   Let me tell you a story.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.980]   So I've been married 30 years.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.580]   And 29 years ago, I was having this great big blowout,
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.260]   unbelievably bitter argument with my new wife.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.740]   And we were arguing about
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.340]   how to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, ironically.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.260]   And here was the deal.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.380]   My wife's from Barcelona,
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.140]   and she's all about vacation and going to the beach.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.940]   And I'm a thrifty, practical American.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.540]   And we had zero money.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.280]   And so I thought we should buy a couch
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.740]   to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.500]   It's like, okay, so this is the argument.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.860]   We had to get borrowing $500.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.260]   I don't think it's horrible 'cause we had no money.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.860]   I was a musician and we were living in the States.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.100]   We had just moved to the States from Spain,
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.180]   and she didn't speak English,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.020]   and she was working a minimum wage job, and it was brutal.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.940]   And so this is the argument.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.060]   Beach, couch, beach, couch, beach, couch, right?
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.220]   And finally, we compromised and went to the beach.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.500]   And that's why I've been married 30 years.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.780]   But that's not my point.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.580]   The key thing to remember
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.100]   is that we were talking about that a couple of years ago,
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.460]   and we got a couch.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.340]   I mean, that was like seven couches ago or something.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.180]   And I don't even remember the couch.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.700]   But I can tell you everything we did on that beach vacation
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.740]   because we were in love and experiencing it together.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.260]   Here's the main mistake that people make.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.580]   They think that physical things are permanent
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.500]   and experiences are evanescent.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.540]   It's exactly the opposite.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.140]   If you experience something with somebody you love,
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.980]   it's permanent, it's permanent.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.180]   But if you get a thing,
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.020]   you'll forget it and not care about it,
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.960]   and it'll be out on the curve of your emotions
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.260]   almost immediately.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.360]   So here's the guide.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.300]   Buying stuff seems permanent,
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.660]   and it will give you the satisfaction,
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.380]   and you're wrong, your brain is lying to you.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.900]   And there's all kinds of evolutionary reasons
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.140]   why your brain is lying to you.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.140]   You need to go to the other three,
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.980]   but you gotta do it in the right way.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.740]   Buying experiences is great,
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.340]   but you have to do that with someone you love.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.780]   You have to buy experiences
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.080]   and experience them with somebody that you love.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.300]   Going with a, maybe the person that you love
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.020]   and you wanna know better is you, by the way.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.480]   And if you really wanna go to the Cambodian temples
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.540]   by yourself because you're actually trying to get in touch
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.860]   with something spiritually,
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.660]   or you wanna go on a retreat in Southern India,
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.820]   which I have done, that's great, fantastic, right?
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.220]   But it has to be for a reason,
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.140]   and the reason has to do with experiences
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.260]   and improvement of a particular relationship.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.140]   Second is buying time.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.620]   Buying time means paying somebody
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.060]   to do something you don't wanna do.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.620]   Now, not everybody listening to us can do that
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.720]   'cause they don't have enough money.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.660]   But if you can, why would you pay somebody
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.340]   to cut your yard so you have more time
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.400]   to do something you do want with someone you love?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.800]   Once again, you see the common point that I'm making.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.120]   If you do it so you can watch something stupid on Netflix,
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.680]   all you did is waste your time and your money,
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.000]   and that's not so great.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.400]   The last is giving it away,
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.360]   but giving it away to a cause that you love
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.880]   and has to serve your values.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.720]   Now, you see what I'm talking about here, Chris?
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   It's love and then love and then love and then love
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.000]   is actually what we're talking about.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.760]   If we wanna turn our,
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.680]   you wanna turn your money into happiness,
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.040]   it has to be based on love.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.000]   - So I heard you say not to watch something on Netflix.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.160]   Would it be fair to say unless you watch something
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.680]   on Netflix that's stupid with someone you love,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.520]   then it's okay?
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.800]   - You got it, you're A+ student.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.600]   - Fine, anything I'm not supposed to do,
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.960]   as long as I do it with someone I love,
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.000]   then I can get around it. - Yeah, if you're wasting
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.880]   your time, this is the reason that neglecting
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.060]   your loved ones while scrolling social media
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.280]   is such a terrible, terrible thing for your happiness
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.480]   because you're doing two things at once.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.560]   Number one is you're numbing yourself
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.600]   with just a little shot of inadequate dopamine
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.800]   and your foregoing love.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.080]   This is crazy, it's crazy plus crazy.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.140]   - Yeah, and so that's an interesting point.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:28.320]   We've talked a little bit here and there about technology.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.780]   I have to assume that technology has made a lot
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.600]   of building happiness in our lives difficult
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.040]   because of distraction or social comparison.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.560]   Is there anything it's done to make happiness easier?
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.200]   - Yeah, so here's the key thing about technology.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.280]   It always over promises and under delivers.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.200]   And I'm not a Luddite, on the contrary.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.760]   I mean, I think this stuff is really great.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.480]   What I am is a social scientist
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.760]   and a specialist in happiness.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.200]   Anything that substitutes for love will make you unhappier.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.520]   Anything that complements your love will make you happier.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.360]   So, well, all of the technologies, what do they promise?
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.080]   Whether it's social media, whether it's Facebook
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.300]   or Tinder or whatever it happens to be,
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.640]   it promises you more love and that's why you want it.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.440]   That's why you, I mean, it's like I'm gonna connect
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.900]   with people, I'm gonna get social contact,
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.720]   I'm gonna meet people, phenomenal.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.960]   It looks really, really great.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.760]   But almost inevitably, it actually crowds out
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.160]   true human experience, the experience of getting
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.980]   to know somebody, to share your heart with somebody.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.160]   Now, there's a lot of neurophysiology to this.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.120]   So, for example, there's a hormone, a neuropeptide
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.240]   that functions as a hormone in the brain called oxytocin.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.060]   This is intensely pleasurable that we get in response
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:40.040]   to eye contact and touch with other people.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.720]   When people are really, really lonely,
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.080]   they do exactly the opposite of what they should do.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.340]   Instead of going someplace and talking to somebody
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.600]   in person, they scroll social media,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.920]   which gives you no oxytocin and makes you lonelier.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.960]   Social media is the junk food of social life
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.040]   and apps for dating, what they do is they crowd out
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.040]   the experience of meeting somebody de novo.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.880]   They also have another big problem,
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.120]   which is that they don't give you enough complementarity
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   with other people and they overload on compatibility.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.200]   They make you so compatible, it's like you're dating
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.400]   your sibling, which is, how shall we say, not hot, right?
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.280]   And so, no wonder that it's like, I don't know,
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.880]   I can't find anybody I'm really attracted to.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.120]   Well, no kidding, it's 'cause you're trying
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.300]   to date yourself, man.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.480]   So, this is a problem with how technology works.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.520]   So, here's the way to judge technology.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.500]   Is it a complement to my relationships,
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.360]   my real in-person, human-loving relationships,
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.600]   or is it a substitute for those relationships?
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.840]   If it's the latter, it's bad for you.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.760]   - I wanna jump to one other aspect of the book,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.400]   and we're not gonna hit on all of the skills
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.220]   or tactics. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.060]   We're having a great conversation.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.880]   - I think that's okay, because you can go buy the book.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.480]   Although, I will say, congratulations,
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.080]   not only did you hit the number one
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.840]   on the New York Times list.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.360]   - Sold out on the end of day one.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.400]   It's like my publisher's like, "I got great news
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.720]   and not great news."
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   I said, "What's the great news?
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.800]   You're number one on Amazon.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.720]   What's the not great news?"
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.360]   There's not a copy for sale in the whole country.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.680]   - By the time you're hearing this,
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.360]   your sold-out book will hopefully
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.840]   have some copies available.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.640]   I know the ebook's also available.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.880]   So people can find that.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.320]   But I wanna jump to one last section,
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.720]   turning weakness into strength.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.560]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.380]   That's a scary one, man.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.220]   That's a scary one.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.880]   But this is a skill that all happy, old people
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.740]   have in common that's really hard
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.920]   for young people to absorb.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.280]   And once again, what's this book all about?
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.200]   This is the Happiness 401(k),
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.320]   meaning that these are the kinds of investments
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.280]   we need to start making at 25 or 45 or 65
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.640]   so that they'll pay off later.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.680]   So it's very important to understand these things
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.920]   from the very beginning.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.460]   Old people all know that what's really off-putting
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.480]   is saying that you don't have strengths
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.040]   and being defensive about your weaknesses.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.360]   It's very off-putting.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.220]   And we have a million ways to call BS on each other.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.100]   It's like, what I could be wearing,
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.980]   it's like I could come and be wearing
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.320]   an obvious toupee right now.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.140]   And I'd be like, "I think it looks pretty natural."
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.640]   And you'd be like, "That thing looks like a bird's nest.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.960]   Are you kidding me?"
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.400]   And it would be ridiculous.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.160]   And it would be a sign of defensiveness
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.660]   and insecurity, and that's the problem
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.560]   because life tells you if you've got a weakness,
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.840]   you should not share it.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.800]   You should defend yourself against it.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.960]   You should hide it, as a matter of fact.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.720]   And that's actually a huge mistake.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.240]   The reason is because what we need is human connection.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.360]   And your weaknesses connect you with other people.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.760]   We're all weak.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.320]   You know, we all have feet of clay.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.800]   It's all like, ugh, we're a bundle of problems.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.880]   And you can't, we have meritorious things, too.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.280]   I mean, you could, you have good things about you
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.000]   that people admire, and that's magnetic, too, to be sure.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.800]   But if you really wanna relate to somebody,
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.680]   you say, like, "I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.200]   and I'm a man of the people.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.440]   You can relate to me.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.120]   I have a million listeners to my podcast."
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   Like, that's not relatable.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.800]   That isn't relatable at all.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.400]   You gotta lead with the ways that you are like other people,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.840]   and that's what old people do.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.680]   It's so funny.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.040]   You know, somebody gave me a piece of advice.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.440]   You know, when I was, I was starting,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.480]   I was after 50, and I came back to academia.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.640]   I was an academic for a long time,
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.880]   and I was a CEO for 10 years of a think tank in D.C.,
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.740]   and I came back to academia three years ago,
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:04.920]   teaching at Harvard.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.440]   And when I first got there, I said, you know,
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.280]   "I got a problem," which is, I'm 50,
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.840]   I was 55 at the time, and I said, you know,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.360]   "I was a musician for a long time,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.840]   and it really hurt my hearing,
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.520]   'cause it's very loud playing in a symphony orchestra."
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.520]   And now, frankly, I'm not, I don't have hearing aids,
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.280]   but I'm getting a little deaf, quite frankly,
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.960]   and I'm in lecture, and these kids, they frickin' whisper.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.640]   I mean, you can't hear a word they're saying,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.000]   and so it's like, I'm like, "What? What?"
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.720]   And I said, and so I asked my colleague,
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.440]   one of my colleagues, like, "What do I do?"
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   And he's like, "You say, 'Hey, I'm 57, I'm deaf, speak up,'
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.620]   and it's hilarious, they all laugh,
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.860]   and they can actually relate to you,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.960]   and they like you better, and they speak louder."
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.460]   So you see what I'm saying, right?
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.840]   I mean, what's the connection?
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.640]   The connection is human frailty,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.180]   and this is what we need to do.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.920]   The most winsome people are non-defensive
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.260]   about their humanity.
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.000]   They're not hiding things.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.560]   They know what they do well,
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.260]   and they know what they do poorly, and it's all good.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.720]   - Yeah, you said in the book negative emotions
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.520]   make us more effective in our day-to-day activities.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.440]   - Yeah, that's actually one of the interesting things
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.680]   in science that we find is that negative emotions,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.240]   well, to begin with,
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   without negative emotions and experiences, we don't learn,
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.440]   and when we don't learn, we don't find meaning and purpose.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.840]   So when people are trying to go from happy feeling
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.660]   to happy feeling to happy feeling,
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.560]   and they're trying to force unhappiness out of their life,
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.220]   paradoxically, they're actually avoiding their happiness
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.840]   because they're not getting sufficient meaning and purpose.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.620]   That doesn't mean we should go looking for suffering,
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.520]   but suffering's gonna find us,
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.480]   and we need to find ways to experience it
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.460]   and learn from it.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.000]   - Is that an indirect argument
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.720]   against being kind of eternally optimistic?
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:49.480]   I know I'll share it's a common argument in our household.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.400]   It's like circumstance arises.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.140]   You could think of glass half full, glass half empty.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.200]   My wife and I often take different sides of that,
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.320]   and it's a little frustrating,
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.080]   and I read that line about negative emotions,
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.000]   and I thought maybe sometimes
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.200]   you should take glass half empty.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.120]   Maybe it's better, or am I misinterpreting?
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.720]   - Well, no, it's absolutely the case,
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.840]   and there's a big philosophical debate about this.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.520]   So my great mentor and friend, Martin Seligman,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.120]   he talks about rational optimism,
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.240]   but what he's really talking about is hope.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.340]   People often use them synonymously,
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.920]   but optimism is really just a prediction
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.800]   that everything will be okay.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.440]   Hope, there's nothing unrealistic about it.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.380]   It's the idea that something can be done
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.000]   to improve the situation, and I can do it.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.320]   It's hugely empowering.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.760]   There's always a reason for hope.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.720]   Hope is a theological virtue in Christianity and Judaism.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.200]   I mean, hope is a good thing.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.280]   It's a good way to be.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.320]   It'll make you happier,
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.160]   and it's a virtuous way to be as well.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.960]   There are lots of times when optimism is just unrealistic,
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.560]   and there are all kinds of reasons to not be unrealistic.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   It's like, yeah, the guy in the Titanic.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.840]   All will be well.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.200]   You know, that's not exactly the right way to be.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.940]   It's better to be realistic, and to do what's appropriate,
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.980]   and to do so with hope.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.180]   So that's the distinction that I would make.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:06.580]   - Okay.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.300]   All right, so I got a few rapid fire things
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.220]   before we wrap up.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:13.300]   One is, I know you have talked in the past
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.820]   about how you had this amazing job.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.380]   Many people would have coveted your job at AEI,
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.340]   the think tank,
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.180]   and then you kind of thought about happiness,
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.420]   and you decided to quit,
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.820]   and I think a circumstance I find a lot of people in,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.920]   at least talking to people in their 20s and 30s,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.080]   they're working a job, they don't love it,
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.960]   but they know that for some reason,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.120]   sticking it out for a little bit of time,
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.040]   maybe not forever, will bring something.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.880]   Whether it's they'll hit their bonus six months from now,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.840]   and that'll give them some comfort
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.480]   with their financial situation,
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.520]   or they'll get that promotion.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.240]   And I'm curious if you think,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.800]   is the answer that sometimes, yes, that's the case,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.640]   or is the answer always, you should probably cut bait
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.480]   as soon as you feel like it's not a good fit?
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.280]   - Well, it really depends on the circumstances.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.560]   I know all kinds of cases
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.920]   where couples are not getting along,
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.480]   but they want their marriage to work.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.680]   You need to think ahead about exactly
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.280]   what the circumstances are,
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.560]   and whether you know something can be fixed,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.720]   and it's perfectly legitimate
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.320]   to suffer through circumstances you don't like in the moment
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.080]   because there's a greater prize.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.960]   You know, the fidelity of your conjugal union
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.680]   is really important to you.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.280]   It's also the case that quitting a job
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.560]   every time you don't like it
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.760]   is a lost opportunity for you to prosper.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.480]   It's a lost opportunity for you to grow as well, too.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.320]   The biggest mistake I see for young people,
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.940]   and this is a very practical thing that I tell my students,
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.500]   is if you quit a job, like your first job at a college,
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.120]   usually within 18 months, you're probably making an error
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   because you're incapable of learning to like it
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.200]   when you change jobs and careers and cities
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.320]   all at the same time.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.600]   That is the same cognitive and emotional impact
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.920]   as immediate family member dying.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.960]   So what happens is people are like, "Congratulations,"
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.600]   but you're actually grieving
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.440]   because there's so much change in your life,
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.520]   and you tend to cross the cables in your mind,
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.320]   and you think that the change per se,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.400]   the grief that you're feeling
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.120]   is because you made an incorrect decision.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.240]   That's wrong.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.600]   And so there are all kinds of ways to stay the course.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.000]   Now, that doesn't mean that you should be like,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   "I hate this job, my life sucks,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.200]   "but 25 years from now, I'm gonna get a pension,
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.360]   "so I'm gonna stick with it."
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.480]   That's an error.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.400]   - You've lived in a lot of places.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.840]   Normally, when someone's kind of calls a place home,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.320]   and I know for you right now, that's Boston,
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.600]   I always say, "Someone listening, come into your city,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.720]   "what's one place they should eat or grab a drink
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.640]   "or go do something?"
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.160]   Like those kind of three things that are atypical.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.680]   I'll give you the freedom to pick anywhere you've lived
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.520]   and tell people, if they're going to that place,
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.760]   what's a kind of off the beaten recommendation
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.400]   for a meal, a drink, and something to do?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.120]   - My favorite city in the world is Barcelona,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.880]   which has been my second home for the past 35 years.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.760]   That's where I got married,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.440]   that's where I played in the symphony orchestra,
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.320]   and that's where my in-laws live,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.480]   and I was always very close to my in-laws,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.520]   I was closer to my mother-in-law
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.760]   than I was to my own mother.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.360]   So I consider that my own home,
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.320]   and it's the city that I actually know best.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.680]   So where are you gonna eat?
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.840]   Any place, it's Barcelona,
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.160]   it's one of the foodie capitals of the world.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.000]   You go to a bar, and you eat some bar food,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:11.840]   and you're gonna be like,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.960]   "This is the best thing I've ever had."
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.800]   What are you gonna drink?
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.120]   I don't know, I don't drink at all, but live it up.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.000]   That's all I can say, it's Barcelona.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.840]   And what are you gonna see as a tourist?
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.360]   Oh man, throw a dart, the place is unbelievable.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.560]   You can go to the Roman ruins,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.960]   you can go to the Sagrada Familia,
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.880]   you can go to the ancient Romanesque churches,
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.200]   you can look at the Gothic cathedrals.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.480]   Holy cow, it's just like a living, walking museum
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.640]   of everything from modernism all the way back
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.480]   to prehistoric times.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.480]   And so go to Barcelona, everybody.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.360]   If you haven't been to Barcelona yet,
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.800]   you're barely living.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.840]   - I have been for only a few days,
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.800]   but it's on the list to go back.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.880]   We have an au pair right now from Tarragona.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.720]   - It's Catalonia.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.560]   - Which is nearby, we talked about.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.800]   - So you actually know the difference.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.000]   I'm a Catalan speaker.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.880]   I'm one of, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.680]   I'm one of the few American Catalan speakers.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.040]   It's a different language than Spanish,
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.880]   and it's the most beautiful language in the world
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.080]   as far as I'm concerned.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.160]   - It is also, for anyone listening who doesn't know that,
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.920]   it was a source of tension because we were in Barcelona
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.520]   and my wife spoke Spanish.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.120]   And I was so frustrated 'cause I was like,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.600]   "Why can't you communicate?"
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   I spoke French, so when we were in Paris, I could help.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.920]   "What is going on?"
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.680]   And she was like, "It's a different language."
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.160]   And I was too naive to understand that at the time.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.000]   - Yeah, no, no, I know.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.840]   I mean, Spanish is great,
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.720]   and everybody does speak Spanish in Barcelona,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.400]   but Catalan is the deep, deep language over there.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.480]   And it's a beautiful language for sure.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.000]   - The last thing I'll put on this list
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.600]   is there's a story you opened the book with
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.480]   that I know in a lot of interviews you started with,
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.960]   but I figure we should end on it,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.600]   which is your situation on an airplane
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.240]   that kind of inspired you to write the book.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.840]   - The great thing about being a social scientist
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.640]   is that the world is my laboratory,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.120]   and all the research is actually me-search.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.480]   That's actually the dirty secret
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.200]   of being a happiness specialist.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.320]   And every time I start on a brand new project,
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.720]   this was a seven-year project.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.160]   I mean, this was an unusually long project.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.680]   It usually comes 'cause I have an experience
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.520]   that really affects me,
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.400]   and that's actually where the story started.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.240]   Eight years ago or so, I was on a night flight
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.160]   from LA to Dulles Airport in Washington, DC,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.400]   and I heard a couple talking behind me on the plane.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.760]   I could kind of hear 'em,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.800]   and I could tell that there was,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.560]   it sounded like a married couple, a man and a woman,
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.120]   and they sounded old.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.520]   Their voices were elderly,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.320]   and I couldn't quite make out the husband's words,
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.800]   but I can tell by his wife's comments
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.520]   that this was serious business.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.880]   She was consoling him and saying,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.400]   "Oh, it's not true that it would be better
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.420]   "if you were dead.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.100]   "It's not true that people don't love you
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.200]   "and respect you, that everybody's forgotten you."
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.840]   It's like, this went on for 20 minutes,
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.080]   and it was just, it was brutal.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.520]   So their flight finally ends,
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.120]   and they turn on the lights, and I'm kind of curious,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.480]   and I'm thinking, you know, look,
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.240]   I'm a student of human behavior.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.960]   This is probably somebody who's disappointed with his life
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.040]   'cause he didn't live up to his own dreams,
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.560]   and I stood up and turned around,
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.320]   and it was one of the most famous men in the world.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.800]   This is somebody who's achieved 10 times
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.880]   what I will in my life.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.440]   I would die to be this guy, so it seems,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.240]   and if I did, I'd dine out on my success
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.080]   for the rest of my life.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.760]   His feats of heroism are decades in the past,
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.360]   but still, he's rich, he's famous, he's got it all.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.960]   I thought, something's up here.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.440]   This is no insurance policy.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.640]   That what the world tells you, that you get successful,
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.120]   and you can bank it and enjoy it for the rest of your life,
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.360]   that's a lie.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.880]   That's an obvious lie.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.080]   So what's the deal?
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.760]   Is he an outlier, or is he typical?
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.160]   Are the strivers the ones who tend to suffer,
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.440]   or does he just have some mood disorder?
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.960]   And that's what started this investigation
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.840]   on what we can all do to invest
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.320]   in our happiness later in life.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.520]   They came up with a lot of the stuff
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.680]   that we're talking about today,
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.920]   was that poor man on the plane,
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.640]   and I still look him up,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.880]   and I pray for him, and I hope for the best.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.000]   That's all I can say.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.320]   - Well, I for one am fortunate you had that experience,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.040]   because it led you to all this research,
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.320]   led you to the book.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.800]   I think I'll be a happier person in the future because of it.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.080]   So thank you.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.720]   Where can anyone here, other than by the book,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.240]   follow up with what you're doing and stay in touch?
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.560]   - So I have a column every week in "The Atlantic"
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.720]   called "How to Build a Life"
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.360]   every Thursday morning in "The Atlantic."
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.840]   So subscribe to "The Atlantic,"
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.520]   'cause you'll get on the wrong side
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.920]   of the paywall real fast,
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.000]   'cause it turns out they wanna make money.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.080]   Capitalists!
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.520]   Anyway, it's every Thursday morning
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.440]   called "How to Build a Life."
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.240]   And if you wanna see just all the different essays,
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.720]   and books, and things that I write about happiness,
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.680]   and even learn about my classes at Harvard,
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.880]   if you go to arthurbrooks.com, all the information's there.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.600]   - Perfect.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.960]   We'll link to everything in the show notes,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.240]   and thank you so much for being here.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.080]   - Thank you, Chris.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.680]   Thanks for what you're doing.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.920]   You're making me happy, too.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.200]   (upbeat music)
