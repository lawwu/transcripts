[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360]   George in Cologne, Germany writes in,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.440]   "Pastor John, if a Christian is born anew
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.040]   "and has died to sin, why is sin in the heart
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.540]   "so decisive, the same for the flesh?
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.180]   "Why must it be killed every day?
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.200]   "My status in Christ and my daily work,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   "this mortification seems and feels so contradictory."
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   What would you say to George, Pastor John?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.520]   - Yes, it does.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.120]   (laughs)
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.680]   I totally resonate.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.580]   Let's try to do two things in answer to George's question.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.560]   First, let's show from the New Testament
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.040]   what actually happens in the new birth,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   especially as it relates to a Christian's ongoing sinning.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   And then second, let's see if we can answer,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.680]   at least partly, why does God do it this way?
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   'Cause that's really the heart of his question.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   But in order to get to that,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280]   I think we need to start with what happens
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.360]   in the new creation or the new birth.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.700]   So my answer to this first question is,
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.040]   what God creates in the new birth
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.840]   is not a sinless Christian.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   What he creates is an embattled, not yet perfect,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.920]   spirit-empowered, persevering, Christ-treasuring,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.100]   sin-hating, new being, new creation in Christ.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.200]   And don't miss those words, embattled and sin-hating.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.880]   The new creation in Christ is a fighter.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640]   Paul said at the end of his life
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   that I have fought the good fight.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.640]   And he tells Timothy, "Fight the good fight."
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   And he means the fight for holiness
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   and the fight for faith, the good fight of faith.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.640]   So notice these four paradoxical pairs of verses
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.480]   to see how the event of new birth
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.920]   relates to this ongoing battle.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   So here's the first pair.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.440]   1 John 3, 9, "No one born of God
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.400]   "makes a practice of sinning."
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.300]   1 John 1, 8, "If we say we have no sin,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.360]   "we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   So new birth creates a DNA, as it were,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.520]   in this new person, like a divine DNA
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.200]   that cannot be content with ongoing sinning,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.400]   though in this life, if we say we have no sin,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   we have a misunderstanding of how it's working.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.880]   So that's the first pair.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   Second pair, Romans 6, 6, "We know that our old self
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.140]   "was crucified with him in order that the body of sin
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.340]   "might be brought to nothing,
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.320]   "so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin."
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.080]   Wow, what an event.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   And then verse 11, "So you must reckon yourself dead to sin."
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   Well, why?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920]   If you're dead, you're dead.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   No, "Reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to God in Jesus.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.500]   "Let not sin reign."
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.560]   This is an imperative.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.840]   Get about the business of killing sin,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200]   reckoning yourself dead to sin,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.520]   and bringing yourself under the reign of Christ,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.040]   not the reign of your mortal body.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.140]   So the indicative statement, you have died,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.160]   and the imperative statement, now consider yourself dead
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.580]   and live in the power of it.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.640]   That's the second pair.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.520]   Here's the third pair.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.220]   Colossians 3, 3, "You have died,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.480]   "and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.300]   Verse five, "Put to death, therefore,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.000]   "what is earthly in you."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.480]   So the death that we died makes us a fighter,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.200]   a fighter against what we've died to, put to death.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.060]   And the last pair is 1 Peter 1, 23,
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.540]   "You have been born again, not of perishable seed,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.920]   "but of imperishable through the living,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.880]   "abiding word of God."
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.140]   Second half of the pair, 1 Peter 2, 1 to 2,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.600]   "So put away all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   "envy, slander, like newborn infants,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.220]   "long for the pure spiritual milk,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.760]   "so that by it, by it you grow up into salvation."
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.400]   So what I infer from those four pairs of verses
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   is that what the new birth, the new creation brings
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   into being is an embattled, not yet perfect,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.180]   spirit-empowered, persevering, Christ-treasuring,
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.800]   sin-hating, new being in Christ.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.600]   And the outcome is guaranteed, but the battle is real.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.520]   And so the last question is, why does God do it this way?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.040]   I mean, He has the power to snap His finger
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.120]   and make us sinless.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.400]   And we know that He does because He's gonna do that
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.680]   in the twinkling of an eye, at the resurrection,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.080]   or in the moment of death,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.640]   and we won't be made into robots when He does it.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.520]   He will make us sinless without in any way
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.640]   making us less human or less free.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   We will never, ever sin again in heaven.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.940]   Why doesn't He do it now?
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.480]   That's the question.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   And I think there is at least one clear macro answer
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.080]   to that question and some less clear micro answers to that.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   Question that flow from the macro.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.200]   The macro answer is, God does it this way
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   because He intends for the process of sanctification
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.520]   to maximize the praise of His glory,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   especially the praise of the glory of His grace.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.940]   And I say that because of numerous places
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.940]   where this is the express intended outcome of sanctification,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.920]   like Philippians 1:11, where the outcome is supposed to be
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.820]   that we are, quote, "filled with the fruit of righteousness
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.520]   "that comes through Jesus Christ
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.260]   "to the glory and the praise of God."
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.780]   So He's gonna bring about a fullness
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   of fruits of righteousness because He means to be praised.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.140]   That's the design in why He does it the way He does it.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.020]   Or 2 Thessalonians 1:11,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.880]   where the outcome of our sanctification is, quote,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.820]   "and you in Him according to the grace of our God
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.300]   "and of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.780]   So whether we can see at the micro level
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.780]   why this is the case, it is clear at the macro level
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.340]   God has chosen to sanctify us through this painful,
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.020]   slow, progressive, embattled way
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.940]   because it glorifies Christ and the grace of God
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.560]   more than if He snapped His finger
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.360]   and made us perfect and sinless at the point of new birth.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   Now, are there any micro sub reasons that we can see
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.140]   that might explain why is that the case?
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.580]   And I'll just mention three.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.100]   One, through this slow, painful, embattled process,
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.020]   we are reminded, John Piper is reminded every day
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.700]   how dreadfully depraved and sinful and helpless I am
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.500]   and would be if left to myself.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.980]   And so God intends for me to know this,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.900]   to feel this by my constant need for warfare
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.080]   to overcome my bent to sinning.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.220]   Number two, flowing from that reminder,
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.740]   we are made, John Piper is made to feel the wonder
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   of God's patience and grace in holding onto me
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.540]   and returning to me again and again
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.600]   and reviving me and fighting for me
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.060]   and bringing me safely to glory,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.220]   at least for 70 years now.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.060]   It is no wonder that the book of Jude
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.700]   closes with a stunning doxology
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.660]   to God's persevering, keeping power
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.800]   in the embattled Christian life.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   Now unto him who's able to keep you
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.060]   from stumbling and falling and present you blameless
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.520]   before his glory with great joy,
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.600]   to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.740]   be glory and majesty and dominion and authority.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.820]   Isn't that amazing that he would,
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.980]   what is he giving glory to God for?
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.100]   He is giving glory and majesty and dominion
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.780]   and authority to God for one simple reason,
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.500]   God patiently keeps working with us until the end.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.380]   That's just astonishing to me.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.300]   And I don't think I would feel that
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.520]   nearly to the level that I do
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.980]   without God doing it the way he's doing it.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.980]   And the last, the third thing I would say
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.980]   is that since true holiness is the reflex
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.960]   of seeing the superior beauty and value of Christ,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.760]   the nature of the daily battle
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.100]   keeps this reality in front of me
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.200]   so that Christ and his beauty and his value
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.720]   remain central in my life.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   So it becomes clear that Satan is defeated
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.600]   not by the mere finger-snapping raw power of God,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   but by the supreme beauty of Jesus Christ
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.720]   that I have to get clear every day from scripture
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.320]   so that I'm more attracted to Jesus than to unholiness.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.220]   So I think the main thing that I would say to George
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.440]   is that whatever the reasons are
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.640]   that God has chosen to sanctify us
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.360]   in this slow, painful, and battled way,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   this choice of his is because he gets greater glory
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.560]   when we fight the battle every day
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.800]   with the weapons he has appointed
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.760]   and the way he has ordained.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.820]   So let's get on with the good fight.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.480]   - Amen, such a great reminder of God's plan
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.800]   in our sanctification.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.480]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, George.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.360]   We are getting a lot of questions of late
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.900]   from our friends in Germany, my fatherland,
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.560]   and for more details about this podcast,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.980]   to catch up on past episodes
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.600]   or to subscribe to the audio feed,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.960]   and even send us a question from Germany,

[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.460]   Tomorrow, we talk about tragedy,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.240]   overload in the digital age.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.100]   How can we navigate all the bad news
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.260]   and the legitimate needs we see in our social media feeds
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.680]   without getting locked up and paralyzed by inactivity?
