[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.400]   This is the track I Love off Trip Lee's previous album, The Good Life, which is about to turn
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.120]   three years old.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.440]   We're back with Trip Lee.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.400]   Trip, I Love is a tongue-in-cheek song about your iPhone.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.560]   Over these years since, what habits have you put in place to ensure that your phone doesn't
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.800]   take up too much of your life or distract you from your family or distract you from
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   God and the spiritual disciplines?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   This is an area ... Well, I wrote that song, I Love, because this was an area that I found
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   is a struggle for me.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.800]   I wrote it as if my iPhone was my girlfriend and she was constantly grabbing for my attention.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   That was just a very real testimony for me and the way that I was feeling and the kind
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.880]   of fight I had to put up in order to focus.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.960]   It can be hard for me, especially when I'm on the road a lot, which requires lots of
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.240]   sitting around and waiting.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.280]   I've found that I've trained myself in any kind of free time to just grab my phone.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.760]   So I really do have to fight about it.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.560]   As far as my family life and spiritual disciplines, I don't have really any kind of magic things.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.620]   When I read the word and when I pray, I have to either leave my phone in another room or
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.920]   put it on do not disturb.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.160]   I absolutely have to, because I found that I definitely will get distracted.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.080]   It'll vibrate and then I'll kind of run to it.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.000]   Or even, the reason why I have to leave it out of the room sometimes or turn the signal
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.040]   off is because I get rabbit trails in my brain too.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.720]   I'll convince myself I need to look something up.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.160]   This is the power of Google on me, is that I never have to wonder anything.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.040]   I can find out right now.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.680]   Any rabbit trail that pops up in my mind, I can pop right to.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.520]   I think at the end of the day, I have to know myself and know myself well enough to know
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   how it distracts me.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.040]   I have to either have my phone off or out of the room when I'm spending time in prayer
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.520]   and in the word, because it will grab me.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.960]   When it comes to spending time with my family, I have to do the same thing.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.760]   I will admit there have been times when I've looked up and realized I was looking down
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.520]   at my phone for 15 minutes and my son's playing right in front of me, or realized that I'm
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   not paying the amount of attention to my wife I should be.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   It's easy to get distracted.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.760]   It really just takes intentionality and knowing myself and knowing when to leave it out.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.400]   It's an ongoing fight for me, something I'm not always great at.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.960]   Are you more disciplined with your phone now than you were three years ago?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   Absolutely.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.400]   I'm absolutely more disciplined now than I was three years ago.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.920]   Me and my wife always have conversations about it.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.840]   We've opened up in our life the perfect freedom to at any time rebuke each other when phones
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.640]   grab too much with no hesitancy.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.680]   I think that's been really good for us, because it's helped us to keep a good check on each
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000]   other, one of the many ways I'm grateful for my wife.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.440]   I have noticed that even outside of time that I spend in the word, the more time I spend
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.580]   reading 10-second tweets and skimming random articles and reading pointless posts, it does
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.520]   affect my attention span when I then go to scripture and try to read for long distances.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.480]   I've really tried to more and more train myself to have more disciplined use of my phone and
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.320]   not just at all times, because I think it does weaken some other muscles that I need
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.520]   for other good things in my life.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.600]   I'm always just increasingly trying to think really carefully about how I'm using my phone
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.880]   and praying God will help me to grow.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   Very good.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   Thank you, Tripp.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   The next song we have is a track off Tripp Lee's previous album, The Good Life.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.920]   Tripp's latest album and his new book are both titled Rise.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   You can get all of those resources at Amazon right now.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   How should we respond when the world doesn't like us?
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.040]   I'll ask Tripp that tomorrow.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.120]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest Tripp Lee.
