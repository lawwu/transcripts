[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   A podcast listener and a friend of ours, a woman, writes in, "Dear Pastor John, I live in Singapore,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   a multiracial and multireligious small country in Southeast Asia.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Nonbelievers sometimes feel the gospel is offensive or extreme because we say that Jesus is the truth
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and the only way to heaven.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I have had people reply by saying, 'So are you saying my religion is fake or I will go to hell
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   when I die?' All religions teach good things. We should respect all religions."
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So how should we handle such a reply, especially in the latter comment about respecting all religions?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   In my society, I find it sensitive to tackle and to discuss this topic.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   What would you say, Pastor John, about handling the offense of the gospel in a pluralistic society?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I think the first thing to say is that the gospel of Jesus Christ, as the Bible presents it, is offensive.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And it is extreme until God opens the eyes of the heart and calls people out of darkness,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   the darkness of rebellion, into the light of faith.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   For example, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 1:23, "We preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and foolishness to the Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   The words "stumbling block" and "foolishness" are very similar to the accusation that the gospel is offensive
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and extreme, and it's true until the calling of God opens their eyes to see the good news.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We need to settle it in our hearts that we are willing to be criticized and even persecuted
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   by bringing the best news in all the world and having it characterized as foolishness.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That has happened everywhere the gospel has been preached for 2,000 years.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Some believe and rejoice in the gospel as the greatest news in the world.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Others do not see it and regard it as the height of arrogance.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So our friend there in Singapore points out that some people stumble over the claim that Jesus
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   is the truth and the only way to heaven.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I think one helpful way to relate to this criticism is to communicate before you hear it
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and after you hear it the amazement, communicate amazement, that God would supply any way of salvation.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Not that he didn't supply ten, but that he would supply any way of salvation to be reconciled with him.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   In other words, Christians should shift the amazement away from the fact that there's only one
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   to the fact that there's one! There's one!
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   This should stun the Christian. If it doesn't stun the unbeliever,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and that sense of amazement might affect the conversation.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Because I think often they feel we're coming with this smug sense that we've got only one thing.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   It's like, "Are you kidding me? God Almighty stepped into the world to save sinners!"
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The Apostle Paul was unashamed to walk into Athens and all of its deities and all of its competing religious allegiances
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and preach like this, verse 30 of Acts 17.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And of this he has given assurance by raising him from the dead. Now when they heard this, some mocked,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and others said, 'We'll hear more about this.'"
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So the response he got is the kind of response we can expect everywhere.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Some mock and some are interested.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   When I hear the kinds of questions that our friend in Singapore is posing,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   it makes me think that perhaps the most helpful thing to draw attention to would be
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that Christianity is a different kind of thing than religion.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Christianity is news. It's news about a historical event.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Just like you'd say, "Did you hear what happened last week?"
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Namely, the incarnation of the Son of God, his life, his death for sins, removal of the wrath of God,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   his dying, his resurrection. It includes his triumph over death and hell and sin and Satan.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And so the provision for reconciliation and salvation and eternal life with God
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   was brought about by this great work of Jesus Christ in history.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Jesus is alive, ruling in heaven today.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   He'll come back unexpectedly to earth to judge the living and the dead.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   This is not a religion. This is news of God's action in history to save rebellious human beings
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   who do not glorify God by trusting and loving and worshipping and obeying him.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So how should we respond if somebody says, "So you're saying my religion is fake?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Well, one response would be to use the analogy of someone who comes to the hospital with a book of sayings
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and someone who comes with an antibiotic to help the person who's dying of pneumonia.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Now, the little book of sayings is not a fake medicine. It's not a medicine at all.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's another kind of thing. But another person comes with an antibiotic.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   This is a medicine. The aim is to save the patient from death.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   One person has a book of sayings to help the person live well until they die.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Another person has a medicine to save the person from death.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's not a matter of what's fake. They're two different kinds of things.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   That's the way it is with Christianity and all world religions.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's another kind of thing. What about responding to the statement,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   "Are you saying I will go to hell when I die?"
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Well, you might respond by saying, "The whole point of the Christian religion
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   is that all people are going to hell when we die. We're all going to hell.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We all deserve God's judgment because of our sin.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   You will not go to hell because of your religion.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   If you go to hell, it would be the same reason I would go to hell.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   We're both sinners. We have both offended God.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We have both failed to love Him and trust Him and honor Him and glorify Him and obey Him,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and therefore our sin is infinite because His honor is infinite.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You and I are in the same condition. Hell is not about religion.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's about God's justice and His response in justice to all of us who have failed to glorify and thank Him."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And then, against that backdrop, you declare that nevertheless,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   God in great love and at great cost has entered into our misery in order to rescue anyone who believes in His Son.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And then if she says, "Well, what about the response, 'All religion teaches good things'?"
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And the answer is certainly, "Well, yes, but this again is a confusion of categories.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Christianity does not offer itself to the world mainly as a superior set of teachings.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   It offers itself to the world as a message, as news about a redemption and a resurrection
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and an eternal life in history through the death and resurrection of the Son of God.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We don't need to get bogged down in arguing who has better teachings.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   The issue is who has a historical intervention of God into this world to bear the sins of man
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   so that salvation can come to undeserving people.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   That's the question, and only Christianity has that message.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And it's the same with our response to the last statement.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   She said, "We should respect all religion."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Well, one could say it depends on what a religion claims to be.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   If it claims to have a better remedy for man's greatest problem, we want to hear it and respect it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Christianity is not first a set of religious practices and ethical teachings that demands respect.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It's news, the best news in the world about the coming of the Son of God into the world
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to bear the sins of man and absorb the wrath of God and reconcile rebels to their Creator.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So, the sum of the matter, it seems to me, in relating to people of other religions,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   the sum of the matter is keep bringing the conversation back to the biggest problem humans face,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   the wrath of God because of our sin.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The greatest question is, has God done something in history so that our sins can be forgiven
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and His wrath can be averted and undeserving people like us Christians can have eternal life?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So, it's not about a superior religious set of practices or teachings.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's about, has God acted to reconcile rebels to Himself?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Amen. What an incredible message of glory entrusted to us and urgently needed in the world.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   May we be given boldness in this work by the Spirit to explain sin and God's wrath
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and the answer that can only be found in Jesus Christ. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Well, do you have a concise question of your own?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   If so, go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and there, look for the button where you can email that question into us.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So, if Jesus was not a sinner in need of repentance, why was He baptized?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It's a simple question, but a perplexing question too.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And we will find out tomorrow.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
