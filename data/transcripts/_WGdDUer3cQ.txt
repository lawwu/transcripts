[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   Question number one comes from Dan.
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.260]   Dan says, "I'm currently pursuing a degree
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.860]   "in computer science and I'm having trouble
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.860]   "finding time to do a much needed self study."
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   In parentheses, Dan says, "What I learned in college
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   "is nowhere near enough," in parentheses.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.780]   How much self studying do you recommend
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.580]   and how do you fit in with all of the schoolwork
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.480]   without getting overwhelmed?
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.620]   Okay, well, I'm not exactly sure
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.860]   what self study refers to here.
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.880]   Do you mean you're not learning enough in the classroom
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.160]   to actually succeed in your computer science classes?
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.180]   Or do you mean there is topics you want to learn in general
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.540]   and you're not able to satisfy that
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780]   through your college curriculum?
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.420]   Either way, either way, we have a more general challenge
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.260]   here, which is you have an intellectual pursuit
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.140]   that is separate from your direct course responsibilities
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.780]   that you want to fit into your college life.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.620]   I am familiar with this.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.500]   I had my share of independent intellectual pursuits
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.380]   when I was a college student.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.620]   I wrote my first book, How to Become,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.620]   no, How to Win at College.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.980]   How to Win at College, I wrote that
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.780]   during my senior year at Dartmouth.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.240]   I also edited a magazine and was a opinion columnist
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.760]   for a while, while at school.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.220]   So I'm used to this idea of having non-class,
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.980]   intellectual but non-class related work
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.020]   to do while in college.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.300]   And so here's a few things to recommend to make that work.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.540]   One, keep your course load reasonable.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.200]   I used to do a lot of work on student stress
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.540]   and reducing student stress.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.220]   And I can tell you one of the biggest causes
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.180]   of student stress, especially at elite schools,
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.700]   is students had course loads that were too heavy.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.980]   Double majors, majoring to minors,
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.960]   trying to fit in an extra course,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.780]   three or four really hard courses pushed together.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.180]   This is a problem.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.540]   If your schedule is too hard,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.340]   your entire semester is gonna be difficult.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.080]   So you wanna have the most reasonable possible schedule
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.460]   in terms of both the overall difficulty
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.060]   and the diversity of different course types.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.580]   Not all quantitative, not all humanities focused.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.340]   Balance types, keep the course load reasonable.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.300]   If you have a lot of credits coming into college,
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.020]   I did some of this, cash that in later in your career
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.420]   to maybe have an independent study
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420]   or just to take a lighter course load one year,
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.860]   keep your course loads reasonable.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.940]   It is the most effective thing you can do to reduce stress.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.260]   I think students get what I used to call
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.060]   heart attack semesters on my study hacks blog back in the day
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.100]   they would get into these hard scheduling situations
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.340]   either because they weren't paying attention.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280]   When they're setting up their schedule,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.580]   they're just trying to solve problems.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.940]   Well, I need this requirement and that,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.060]   why don't I get this out of my way?
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.900]   That sounds interesting.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.820]   They're just not paying attention
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.540]   to the impact of their choices
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.820]   or they're laboring under the delusion
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.620]   that the harder their schedule,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.180]   somehow the more impressive that will make them.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.260]   A lot of college students labor under this delusion
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.100]   that there is a college admission style committee
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.220]   in their future that's going to look at their schedule
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.900]   and say, how many things did Dan do?
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.060]   How hard was Dan's schedule?
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.740]   To figure out whether or not to let them in.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.240]   That doesn't happen after college.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.700]   That's not the way job interviews work.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.780]   That's not the way you move through the professional world.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.340]   No one cares that your sophomore fall semester
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.220]   was really difficult.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.860]   No one will even notice.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.620]   You suffer that pain, you get very few benefits for it.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.860]   So make your course load easier, Dan,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.140]   if you want to do extra work.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140]   If you're doing extra work,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.060]   treat it like a major extracurricular,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.580]   meaning don't have many other
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.140]   major extracurricular pursuits.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.500]   This should be one of them.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.320]   Don't be trying to edit a magazine
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.980]   and writing for the paper
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.380]   and being a part of the dance team
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.640]   and do major self-study.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.820]   You actually have to treat it with respect.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.140]   If it's one of the things you're working on,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.500]   don't put too many other extracurriculars
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.340]   onto your schedule.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.780]   And finally, leverage autopilot schedules.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.940]   Big piece of advice I give to college students,
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.300]   for every work that happens regularly,
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.940]   I always have this reading assignment
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.140]   in this English class.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.980]   I always have a weekly problem set
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.140]   in this computer science class.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.700]   For work that happens regularly,
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.300]   figure out when and where each week
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.700]   that work gets done.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.300]   This day, this time, then this location,
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300]   that's when I do the first half of my reading.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.900]   This day, this time, this location,
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.780]   that's when I do the second half.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.940]   My problem set, I always do one hour
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.500]   right after the class when it's assigned.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.280]   I go to the library right next to the classroom
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.120]   and I prep it.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.020]   I go through the problems.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.380]   I see which ones I know how to solve,
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.220]   which ones look hard.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.900]   Then I have a meeting with my problem set group.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.100]   We always do that the next night at seven
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.580]   here in the study room that we have a reservation for.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.700]   Then I have a two hour block
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.860]   I always put together the next morning
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.100]   to clean up what we did and write it up.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.420]   Whatever, these are sample schedules,
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.860]   but it's the same time, same day, same places.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.820]   It's an autopilot schedule
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.420]   because it makes you not have to actually think
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.940]   and make decisions about when and where
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.760]   you're gonna work.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.600]   Should I work now?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.420]   What should I work on today?
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.700]   It's all made automatic.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.940]   So autopilot schedule your schoolwork,
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.700]   add the self-study into the autopilot schedule.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.420]   That is how I wrote how to win a college my senior year.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.660]   90 minutes, first thing in the morning.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.740]   Everyone was still asleep.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.740]   I remember the Wheeler apartments for Dartmouth people.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.940]   I was in the Wheeler apartments
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.220]   with a couple of buddies of mine.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.380]   Hat tip to John.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.100]   Who else was in that apartment?
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.820]   Lee, maybe hat tip to Lee.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.500]   I don't quite remember everyone who was there,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.540]   but I had a room with a radiator
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.260]   that would spit hot water into the air
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.740]   because this was very old heating technology.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.620]   And there was one of those old-fashioned,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.700]   over-polished, varnished, indestructible college desks
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.520]   in the room.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.620]   I would get up, go to the desk,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.420]   and I would write 90 minutes, weekday mornings,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.740]   repeat, and a book was written.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.900]   All right, Dan, so I used your question as an excuse
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.620]   to go broader to some of my more general thoughts
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.320]   about getting through college.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.160]   (upbeat music)
