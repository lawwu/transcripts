[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   If you get a notification from what appears to be an organization of authority, you have
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.180]   to think about it.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.980]   First, the IRS doesn't email anybody.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.860]   Police departments wouldn't normally send you an email and go, "Hey, by the way, we
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.700]   think you've committed a crime, so notify us here."
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.100]   What you should do, even if you get one that looks really, really official, contact the
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.460]   specific agency and independently confirm the contact information and then reach out
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.100]   to them and say, "I got the strangest thing.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.500]   Did you send me something?"
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.300]   Now, most people don't like to red flag themselves with the IRS, but at the same point, you need
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.420]   to make sure that you're dealing with the IRS and, of course, generally, the only way
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.480]   they deal with you initially is you get a letter.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.220]   Maybe not a letter you want to receive, but you will get a letter.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.840]   They don't call you unless you owe them money.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.300]   You've owed them money for a very long time.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140]   They've sent you notice after notice after notice.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.440]   You didn't respond, and then you might, might get a call from a legitimate debt collector.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.380]   There are about three or four that have been designated by the IRS, but again, generally,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.180]   it's never something where you're asked to do something urgently.
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.460]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.380]   money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.820]   to optimize my own life by sitting down each week with the world's best experts to learn
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.100]   the strategies, tactics, and frameworks they use for their own lives and their success.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.780]   Today, I'm talking with Adam Levin, who's an absolute expert on cybersecurity, privacy,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.380]   identity theft, and fraud.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.220]   At 27, he became the youngest director in the history of the New Jersey Division of
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.820]   Consumer Affairs.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.620]   He later went on to found at least two companies, Credit.com, which focused on consumer credit
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.060]   building and was acquired in 2015, and CyberScout, a global identity and data protection company
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.900]   that helped pioneer the cyber insurance business and was acquired in 2021.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.300]   On top of all that, he's the author of the critically acclaimed book, Swiped, How to
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.540]   Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Fishers, and Identity Thieves, and he hosts
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.840]   the weekly cybersecurity podcast, What the Hack?
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780]   For many months, I've been wanting to do an episode on everything you need to know about
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.660]   cybersecurity identity theft, so I'm really excited that I got connected with Adam.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.560]   We're going to talk about how to protect yourself from all these threats, what kind of tools
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.500]   and services like VPNs or security keys or credit monitoring are actually worth using.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.900]   Basically, I want to leave you with everything you need to know to protect yourself online.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.020]   Adam, welcome to the show.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.420]   Chris, thanks so much for inviting me.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.940]   So just to kick us off, I want to know, what do you think is the most common thing you
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.780]   see most people doing wrong when it comes to protecting themselves online?
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.420]   Password protocol is terrible with most people.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.460]   Most people pick a easily decipherable simple password because that's what they can remember,
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.380]   and they use it everywhere.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.100]   And unfortunately, what you have to understand is that even assuming that you had the most
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.700]   indecipherable, sophisticated password possible, if it's been exposed as a result of a leak
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.720]   or a breach, then it's discovered, and a discovered password is no good to you anymore.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.920]   And if it's through your entire universe of websites, it's going to come back and be a
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.060]   nightmare for you.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.660]   So you really have to think hard about the kinds of passwords you're going to use.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.660]   In fact, that's why most people use password managers that want to simplify their lives.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.300]   But you need to do that because one ubiquitous password in your life is guaranteed to create
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.400]   a problem for you.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   I know that in the past, you know, password managers often will tell you this password's
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.380]   been in a breach is there was a site that was like, have I been pawned?
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.300]   Is that still like the gold standard of finding out what passwords of yours have been in a
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.020]   breach or what is it?
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.020]   It pretty much is.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.020]   Have I been pawned?
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.580]   And it's not a happy place by any means.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.540]   And you can also now track your phone number too.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540]   Oh, cool.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.540]   Because, you know, the issue is that, you know, for years we've been told that the,
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.740]   the ultimate skeleton key to your life is your social security number.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.460]   And that's pretty much true.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.020]   But if you think about it now, everybody gives their cell phone number out to everybody.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.020]   And on top of which it's not something because they're now portable, nobody's going to change
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.820]   their cell phone number.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.460]   So this is a number that's going to stick with you most of your life.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.000]   And it is everywhere.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.500]   So that that's an issue as well.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.060]   What's the risk of your phone number being out there?
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.780]   Obviously people can call you, but is it that they could know your number and spoof your
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.580]   number calling customer service and pretend to be you with automated systems or why is
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.220]   having your number out there, you know, as, as bad or dangerous as maybe your email password,
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.060]   which makes more sense to me why that would be a bad thing.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.780]   Well, the reason why having your number out there is a problem is because if you think
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.220]   about it, most people who use multi-factor authentication, the second factor tends to
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.440]   be they a code sent to their phone number.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.380]   But so if your, if your phone number is stolen as a result of a SIM swap, which is not as
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.420]   difficult as one would think is for a few bucks, unfortunately, people call people at
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   mobile providers and get them to switch things based on the fact that they go, I'm sorry
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.180]   that I forgot my password and this is my phone number and I just got a new device by the
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.180]   way.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.700]   So can you please transfer to my new device?
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.020]   And then all of a sudden you don't get the code.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.940]   We've had cases where people have lost millions in cryptocurrency because the code was sent
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.300]   to the phone number that had been stolen by a hacker.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.860]   Now I know in five, 10 years ago, SIM swapping kind of hit all the news and it was a big
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860]   thing.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.220]   Is that still happening as much as it was, or have the carriers gotten better about requiring
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.780]   more information to switch a phone number or is it still a really big concern?
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.120]   Well, again, if you pay somebody off, it doesn't matter, you know, what kind of protocols you
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.060]   have in place the carriers are getting better.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.420]   And of course, now you have the opportunity to use a pin number as an additional layer
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.780]   of security for someone calling to find out more about your phone.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.420]   The only problem is that a lot of people, just like we tend to use simple passwords,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.040]   people use codes like 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.060]   So it's not that difficult to guess for some of the bad guys.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.860]   So it sounds like a quick thing everyone needs to do.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.780]   If you're not already using a password manager, I mean, go back to basics.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.940]   That's something you should do.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.980]   I think most people here have probably heard me talk about password managers enough to
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.820]   hopefully have gotten on the board with that train, but calling your cell phone carrier
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.300]   and making sure you have that pin set up.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.860]   I know I called Verizon once and just said, Hey, can you put me in some sort of more secure
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:37.240]   version of, you know, an account that that can work with some banks, financial institutions,
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   some don't.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.580]   I also like to change my mother's maiden name and give them a different word or number or
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.820]   any string of characters than an actual mother's maiden name, because that like your phone
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.220]   number is not too difficult to find online.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.700]   Are there any other kind of fundamental basics to protect yourself from SIM swapping that
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   people should be doing?
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.020]   Well, I mean, you know, that also just be very alert.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:08.260]   And if if all of a sudden you're not getting phone calls or you're not getting texts or
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:14.320]   something just doesn't feel right, immediately contact your mobile provider.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.640]   But you also brought up an interesting thing, too, when you talk about changing your mother's
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.340]   maiden name.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.100]   I always say to people, listen, when you set up security questions and answers, lie like
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.100]   a superhero.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.460]   I mean, Clark Kent is not going to tell people he's Superman.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.980]   Bruce Wayne doesn't run around saying, Hey, I'm Batman.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.180]   So if your mother's maiden name is Smith, tell people it's Jones.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.780]   If you went to Ridgefield High School, tell them you went to to Southwick.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.900]   The key thing is consistency.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.900]   It's not as if you're doing an interview to get a security clearance for national security.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.580]   All you're trying to do is create something that will be a benchmark.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.040]   So it's not about veracity.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.540]   It's just about consistency.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.820]   Sometimes I just have strings of numbers.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.500]   You know, I use one password and I generate a random string of characters.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.180]   So it's like, what's your favorite book?
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.220]   It might be, you know, gobbledygook to me.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.580]   It's just a bunch of numbers and symbols and letters, but it certainly isn't something
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.220]   anyone would guess.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.780]   And the same goes for the high school I went to, or my dog's name, or things that you might
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.380]   actually be able to find out online.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:27.740]   No, no, listen, that's a great idea, as they say, the algorithm.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.340]   There's a lot of places we could take this, right?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.740]   I didn't think identity theft is a big area, cybersecurity is a big area.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.840]   Maybe we start with credit identity.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.060]   You mentioned social security number is this protected thing.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.620]   With the Equifax breach, in my mind, it's like, I'm kind of operating like my social
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.700]   security number's out there.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.700]   I feel like for, I don't know, one in three Americans now, your social security number
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.100]   is out there.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.860]   Is that still as easily accessible such that if someone wants your social security number
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.180]   and they try hard enough, they can probably get it?
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.140]   And if so, what do we do?
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.140]   Let's face it.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.340]   I mean, not just Equifax, we're talking about over the past several years, billions, and
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:15.220]   that's Dr. Evil, pinky to the lip B, billions, billions of files have been exposed through
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:24.380]   data leaks, breaches, people hitting the wrong key and information getting out there.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.500]   People just giving out their social security number.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.540]   I mean, think about every time you go to the doctor's office, the dentist's office, what
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.980]   do they have on the form?
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.620]   Your social security number, which by the way, you can say, no, I'm not giving you my
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.340]   social security number.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.180]   They're not going to throw you out because they're either operating with your insurance
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.740]   information or they're going to get a credit card before you ever get out the door.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.540]   So you don't need to give them your social security number.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.700]   You need to say, no, we have to have it for insurance purposes.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.140]   No, they don't.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.140]   They really don't.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:02.420]   So, but I mean, there have been stories about people at their children's Little League games,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.820]   they were passing around these sheets and people were filling them out and say, yeah,
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.140]   let me have your social security numbers.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.140]   Well, yeah, sure.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.140]   Here it is.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.580]   You know, people don't really think about it.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.260]   They kind of toss it out like you were tossing out rose petals.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.680]   So I think you have to assume your social security number is out there.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.220]   You have to assume most of your information is out there.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:31.180]   So it's really about something that I developed with my collaborator, Beau Friedlander, who's
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.740]   also my cohost on What the Hack with Adam Levin.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.980]   We wrote a book called Swiped, How to Protect Yourself in a World Filled with Scammers,
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.460]   Phishers, and Identity Thieves.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.980]   We came up with a framework, 3Ms.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.220]   How do you minimize your risk of exposure, reduce your attackable surface?
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.940]   How do you monitor so you effectively know that there's a problem and that you have to
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.580]   do something about it?
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.620]   And then how do you manage the damage?
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.060]   So what you're raising right now with the fact that our information is out there is
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.820]   how do you effectively monitor so you know as quickly as possible that you have a problem?
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.900]   Well, one of the things you do is, as we mentioned earlier, you go to the site Have I Been Pawned
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.300]   and see whether or not your user ID and password has been exposed in a breach.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.060]   And then looking at the particular breach where it was exposed, you're going to know
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.700]   based on the information that has been provided by the companies that have been compromised
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.980]   how much of your information is out there.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.660]   And that's why monitoring is so important.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.380]   Get your credit report.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.380]   Look at your credit.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.060]   Don't just say, "I got my credit report.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.980]   I did my good deed."
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.980]   Get it.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   Review it.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.020]   Be serious about it.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.520]   If something doesn't look right, contact the credit reporting agency.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.540]   You need to be looking for things you didn't do as well as things that you might have done
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.460]   that you forgot you did.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.940]   But review it and make sure that it says what you think it should say.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:10.860]   And if it has additional dates of birth out there for you or different places where you've
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.460]   never worked or different home addresses, these are red flags.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.460]   So get your credit report.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.020]   Monitor your credit scores because if your credit scores take a sudden precipitous drop
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.980]   that you can't explain, then it's either one of three reasons.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.940]   You didn't pay a bill on time.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.940]   Not good.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.940]   You need to know that.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.180]   You're using too much of your available credit.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   Not so good.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.700]   You need to know that.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.920]   Or you're a victim of identity theft.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.060]   Really not good and you need to know that.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.820]   Also sign up for what's called transactional monitoring alerts.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.220]   This is from your financial institutions, your credit card companies.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.900]   It's free and it notifies you any time there's any activity in your account.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:01.860]   And if you see activities going on that do not look familiar, then you have to notify
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.380]   your financial institution or the credit card company immediately.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.180]   But that's one of those red flags.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.820]   Also, believe it or not, look at your explanation of benefits statements that you receive from
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.100]   your health insurance company, because a lot of people have discovered that they were victims
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.220]   of medical identity theft because there was a treatment on there or an appointment on
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.480]   there that they never had with a doctor they've never heard of.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.020]   So look at that to make sure it was you.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.860]   And then finally, there are much more sophisticated forms of monitoring that come from the three
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:45.260]   credit reporting agencies, as well as third-party providers, where they have a number of different
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.780]   things that they're monitoring.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:53.420]   You need them to be monitoring your social security number and your most personal information.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.780]   And then you need to get things like what's called instant alerts, which is not, "Hey
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.500]   Chris, a few weeks ago, somebody using your information to open an account."
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.480]   But it's, "Hey Chris, somebody is attempting to open an account right now.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.740]   Is it you?
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.940]   Yes or no?"
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:17.140]   And then you need to have monitoring that monitors the dark web, because if it shows
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.020]   up that your information is out there, and it will tell you what information has been
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:30.060]   discovered on the dark web, whether it's an email address, a password, a phone number,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.340]   account information.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.660]   That's why it's important to do that.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.420]   So the third M is very important, the second M, very important.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.900]   So just to recap, so I know getting your credit report, freeannualcreditreport.com, you can
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.900]   get it for free.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.900]   Yes, you do.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.500]   I believe even right now, as a result of maybe the pandemic, you can get it more regularly
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   than once a year.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.080]   You are getting it in some cases, either once a month or once a week, depending upon the
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.420]   credit reporting agency.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.420]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.500]   And then a lot of the alerts you talked about are free.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.580]   I sign up, I have an account with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.060]   I get alerts, I don't pay for any of those premium services.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.540]   I get my credit score, gosh, I probably have five different ways to get it for free, whether
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.460]   it's Credit Karma, which isn't necessarily your FICO score, but it is a score, or different
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.580]   credit card companies, Amex gives you a free credit score, I think Capital One gives you
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.300]   a free credit score.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.940]   Are there any of the credit monitoring and reporting services that you actually should
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:36.220]   pay for, or are they kind of all a little bit fluffy products that people create for
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.300]   people who are worried, but you can kind of do all this on your own?
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.860]   I know you can freeze and lock your credit, which I do, for free also.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.860]   Yes.
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   No, you can do that.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:53.060]   That's as a result of an amendment to a banking law that was done a few years ago.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:17:00.060]   But there are services that are worth it, because you really need them to take in-depth
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:07.780]   dives, and whereas with free credit reports, you can get them frequently, although a little
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.100]   less frequently now.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:16.780]   The important thing is, you really need to keep up to date, and with that payment, you're
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.860]   not just paying for the monitoring, but you're also getting access to a professional that
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.460]   can help you through identity incidents.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.660]   And that's really the third M, is that how do you manage the damage?
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:37.460]   Now a lot of people don't realize that through their insurance companies, some financial
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.420]   institutions, and now more and more through their employers, there are programs available
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.880]   to help you through identity incidents.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.220]   In some cases, it's free as a perk of your relationship with the institution.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.340]   In some cases, it's deeply discounted.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.280]   In some cases, it may not be.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.740]   But you have to really think about how important it is to know whether or not you've got a
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.020]   problem and have somebody who can help you through the problem.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.980]   I get that if you are involved in an incident, it can be helpful to have an expert get through
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.660]   this entire thing, manage the entire process.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:18.660]   But for just monitoring, would you say everyone needs to be using a premium service, or how
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.180]   do you set the threshold for someone thinking, "Okay, I feel like I've got monitors.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   I get my alerts.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.340]   I get my transaction alerts.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.460]   I check my credit every so often.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.100]   When my score changes, I get an alert."
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.860]   Does the average person in that circumstance who hasn't yet been a victim of any fraud
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.860]   or theft need the premium services?
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:43.820]   Well, it depends how premium you want to go, and you have opportunities to select amongst
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:50.420]   those premium services, and even then, the level of premium service you wish to get.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:59.740]   It really has to do with your comfort level, and how alert you are, and how informed you
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.980]   think you are based on the alerts you're seeing.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:09.220]   The truth is, access to a professional to help you through incidents is priceless.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.540]   It really is.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:18.060]   If you talk to a lot of the folks who have been on both sides of the cyber world, they
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.100]   will all tell you that so much information is out there about us right now, that the
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.540]   fact that each and every one of us hasn't become a victim of some form of identity theft
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.180]   is simply because they haven't gotten around to us yet.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.580]   It's really a question of supply and demand.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.900]   I can tell you, having owned a company, well, first a company that was involved in monitoring,
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:48.060]   and then a company that was involved in managing damage and taking care of people, it really
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:53.340]   depends on what you want to get out of it, how much you're willing to invest.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.300]   It's not a criminally expensive amount if you get the more moderately priced monitoring
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.540]   programs.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.940]   You really need to know, and you need to know as quickly as possible, and you have to pay
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.260]   attention.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.860]   I imagine if I Google credit monitoring services, there's thousands.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.340]   I imagine some are much worse than probably just repackaging what you can get for free
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.700]   for a fee.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.460]   Are there particular companies or services that you think are actually providing that
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.460]   added value for their fees?
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.460]   There are.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:31.380]   We don't single out anybody specifically, and it's not because I'm being paid by anybody
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.020]   in particular.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.100]   I really feel like it's a function of, you really need to do your research.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:45.740]   Now, the Consumer Federation of America has a website called, I think it's called idtheft.info.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.620]   I could be wrong, but just look up Consumer Federation of America.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:59.060]   They actually have the majority of the major players in the identity monitoring service
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.380]   world signed up.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.020]   They signed up for best practices.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:11.860]   What they do at that website is they give you a list of questions and answers to think
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.780]   about when you're searching for someone to monitor your credit or to actually help you
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.580]   through a credit incident, and it's really worth it to go to that website.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:28.900]   But there are a number of very good companies that have very good and thorough monitoring
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.220]   programs.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.780]   But as with anything, take time and do your research.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.220]   I was hoping I could skip a little of the research and get the answers from you.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.860]   Are there any companies you know in this space that's like definitely avoid, like companies
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.580]   that are on your blacklist of credit monitoring and identity theft protection?
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.260]   Are there services where you're like, "Nah, just skip over LifeLock.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.180]   They're the worst," or something, anyone in the space to avoid?
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.180]   Well, no.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.020]   Well, see, now you're getting me to actually recommend certain companies.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.220]   I mean, first of all, okay, I'll give you some.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.100]   Aura is one that's very good.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.340]   LifeLock is very good.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.860]   I can tell you for years, I've used Experian and Protect My ID, their program, that's very
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.900]   good.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:23.860]   My old company, Credit.com, we had a number of products and services that we matched people
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.820]   with that were very good.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:33.420]   And I'm sure the folks at Credit Karma and other places can also give you recommendations.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:39.780]   Another place to go, just for just great advice in general, is the Identity Theft Resource
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.780]   Center.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.780]   They're out of San Diego.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.020]   Eva Velasquez is the CEO.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.700]   She's been CEO for a while.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.660]   They're highly respected, and for those people who don't use paying services and are in trouble
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:58.460]   and need help and are victims of identity incidents, they actually work with some of
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:05.060]   the bigger companies and have a deal going on where these companies will help them help
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.020]   people for free.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.040]   So the Identity Theft Resource Center, ITRC, is very good.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.260]   Thanks for giving some information that I know you've been giving a lot.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.260]   Breaking the rule.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.580]   One thing I was just thinking about, with credit cards, I think a lot of the reason
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:28.360]   people are not too worried about just putting their credit card number online is that most,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.740]   if not all credit card companies nowadays, take the burden of the risk of something happening
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.700]   and fraudulent charges.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.420]   But one thing I don't think I know, so I'm assuming most people don't, if someone uses
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.220]   your social security number to open a bank account or take out a mortgage or a loan or
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.760]   buy a car, how much of the liability ends up falling on you?
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.580]   Is the risk all the hassle of cleaning it up?
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.740]   Or is there actually risk that you could be liable for what happens and someone else won't
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.380]   pick up the tab like they might with credit card fraud?
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:05.020]   Well, we've seen, for instance, situations where people have had their social security
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.260]   numbers used to take mortgages out on their homes.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:17.720]   That becomes problematic because you really need attorneys for that and it's not a simple
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:24.820]   process to have a mortgage removed from your home when the money was actually taken using
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.260]   your information.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.280]   Now your insurance company can be very helpful there.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.220]   That's why check with your insurance company and find out if they have identity protection
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:42.220]   programs, if it's automatic or you need to bring it on as an endorsement to your insurance
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.340]   policy, oftentimes your homeowner's policy, your renter's policy, and now even they're
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:54.340]   offering identity theft services through auto owner policies.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.780]   But you may need that insurance coverage for that.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.900]   That you may pay for, but it's not a large sum of money.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.580]   It's just generally a fee for an endorsement.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.500]   But no, it can be a problem.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.340]   We've seen cases, for instance, with Zelle.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.020]   Now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just came out and kind of dropped the hammer
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:22.340]   on a number of those peer to peer payment apps because so many people have had their
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:28.260]   information stolen, the app used, or they in good faith used it because they thought
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.340]   they were dealing with somebody real and not an identity thief or a hacker or a scammer
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.340]   and the money's gone.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.980]   And of course they do tell you before you hit that button, make sure you know who you're
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.420]   dealing with.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.360]   But that's changing.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.860]   But let me take you back to sort of the beginning of identity theft.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:56.000]   And in the early days of dealing with identity theft issues, and even to a little bit today,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.060]   the victim was guilty until proven innocent.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.860]   And in fact, the consumer was considered collateral damage.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:12.020]   It was viewed as the business was the victim of the identity theft or the fraud.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.380]   Now with credit cards, you're right, banks, it used to be $50 liability.
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.940]   It's now down in most cases to zero.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.680]   Debit cards, little different story.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:28.180]   Many of them have good protections, but in some cases, the financial institution will
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.140]   say that before we return your money to you, we have to do an investigation and we have
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.420]   to feel comfortable that you didn't just do something dumb and you're trying to get us
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.020]   to cover your loss.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.580]   Fortunately, most people listening here are a big fan of earning credit card points and
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.700]   aren't using their debit card much.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.900]   But the identity theft, yeah, I'd love to go back.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.660]   So to the beginning, you were the victim.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.660]   How has that evolved?
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.800]   Well, it's evolved now that there is a greater understanding of the fact that millions upon
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.300]   millions of people have become victims of identity theft.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.780]   And in many cases through no fault of their own, simply their information was on the wrong
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.780]   database at the wrong moment and the wrong person gained access.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.700]   And now suddenly they're victims of identity theft.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.740]   And you have so many different levels of identity theft.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.220]   You have the low hanging fruit, which is account takeover, which has to do with credit cards
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.340]   and debit cards.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:32.880]   Debit cards raise the food chain a little bit.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.100]   Then you have new account identity theft.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.820]   That's where someone using your information has gone about the countryside, happily opening
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.980]   accounts in your name with your information, running up the balances and then disappearing
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.060]   into the sunset.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.360]   And then you get other forms of identity theft, like medical identity theft, where someone
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.620]   using your information gets medical treatment in your name, has a procedure in your name,
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.300]   has appointments in your name.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.780]   In most cases, it's a fraud against the insurance company, but it could come back to haunt you
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.380]   depending upon your lifetime allowances.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:16.740]   But in cases where insurance wasn't involved, you've had many situations where people get
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:22.220]   a bill that comes out of nowhere from a medical provider and it's huge.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   And they end up having problems with their credit reports and fighting with the medical
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.340]   provider and being sued.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.740]   There is a greater understanding of that now.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:39.060]   There's child-related identity theft, where kids have no idea because they don't check
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.060]   their credit.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.180]   They don't even think they have a credit report.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.200]   Most parents don't check their kid's credit reports, although that's changing.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.100]   But in that case, I mean, we had one guest on What the Hack, Axan Betts-Hamilton, who's
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:29:00.060]   become a very famous expert on identity theft, where she was a victim and her mother was
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.700]   the thief.
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.940]   Her mother stole her identity, her father's identity, her grandfather's identity, had
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940]   a second life.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.940]   Oh my gosh.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:15.820]   And as Axan said, I spent Thanksgiving sitting across the table for 19 years across from
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.820]   my identity thief.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:25.260]   And there are a not insignificant number of identity theft victims where it occurs within
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.220]   the family.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.980]   Foster children, for example, 10% are victims of identity theft because as they go through
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.620]   the foster system, they have a card with their information that's passed from family to family
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   to family.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.660]   And in many cases, that information is used to steal their identity.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.900]   So you have that, and now the government's gotten involved and try to be more helpful
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.500]   in situations like that.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:57.420]   Obviously, reporting agencies are much more understanding when it comes to this.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.660]   But there is a process that you go through.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:07.700]   And if you do it, it could take months, hours of your life.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.420]   You could end up with no life and no job and no family because you're spending so much
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.100]   time focusing on resolving your identity theft issue.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:23.860]   For instance, if you become a victim of criminal identity theft, that's a big problem.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.620]   That's where someone using your information commits a crime.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:33.900]   There was a movie, Identity Thief, that you may have seen, but they commit a crime.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.820]   We had a case once, a fellow was driving through the Midwest.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.860]   He gets pulled over for a busted taillight.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.100]   All of a sudden, his car is surrounded by guys with guns.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.400]   They make him get on the ground.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.140]   They cuff him in front of his kids.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.980]   They take him to jail, and he gets out in a couple days.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.100]   But he needs to get a lawyer, and sometimes it takes a not insignificant amount of time
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.980]   to clear your name if you're a victim of criminal identity theft.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.260]   Is there a way that he could have prevented that?
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.560]   Obviously, committing a crime isn't something that's necessarily going to show up on your
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560]   credit report.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.460]   But is there a similar thing that monitors, I don't know, I know every time you apply
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.200]   for a job, they run a background check.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.420]   Is there like a background check monitoring service to see if things like that are happening
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.420]   before you're-
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:32.860]   Well, there are some of the services now that will monitor as part of their overall monitoring,
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:39.020]   whether you've had incidents of a criminal nature, or at least there are warrants out
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.280]   there for you that you might not know about.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.100]   But criminal identity theft is something that you can almost do absolutely nothing about.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.980]   I mean, it's just someone did it, used your information, committed the crime.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.300]   It's not like, how do you prove you didn't commit a crime, right?
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.740]   That's a little more difficult than someone nailing you for committing a crime.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.900]   So it becomes more complicated.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.640]   That's why it's so important for people to be alert.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.620]   If you get a notification about something, don't assume if you know nothing about it
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.480]   that it's a mistake.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.720]   At the same point, don't immediately jump and try to do something about it because it
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.560]   could be somebody committing a fraudulent act and getting you to click on the wrong
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.400]   link or open the wrong attachment as well.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.300]   I want to come back to a few things, but when you get that link, when you get that email,
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:37.480]   I think it's wild to me how many different examples I've seen recently of successfully
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.440]   convincing people that this is the right link, whether it's using some weird font that doesn't
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.320]   actually isn't actually the right font.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:50.640]   I've seen one where someone had the domain register that was like mail.google.com.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:57.680]   So it looks in a small window like it's correct, but then it's mail.google.com.someotheraddress.someotheraddress.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.160]   So it actually looks like the right prefix, but it's not.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.820]   So I always say, of course, look at the full URL, look at the full sender.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.600]   Are there other things in those moments that are things people could quickly do just to
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.720]   make sure or validate that it's correct?
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:23.480]   If you get a notification from what appears to be an organization of authority, you have
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   to think about it.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.280]   First, the IRS doesn't email anybody.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.140]   Police departments wouldn't normally send you an email and go, "Hey, by the way, we
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.000]   think you've committed a crime, so notify us here."
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.380]   What you should do, even if you get one that looks really, really official, contact the
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:47.720]   specific agency and independently confirm the contact information, and then reach out
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.400]   to them and say, "I got the strangest thing.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.200]   Did you send me something?"
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.580]   Now most people don't like to red flag themselves with the IRS, but at the same point, you need
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.720]   to make sure that you're dealing with the IRS, and of course, generally, the only way
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.760]   they deal with you, initially, is you get a letter.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.520]   Maybe not a letter you want to receive, but you will get a letter.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.120]   They don't call you unless you owe them money.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.560]   You've owed them money for a very long time.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.420]   They've sent you notice after notice after notice.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.720]   You didn't respond, and then you might, might get a call from a legitimate debt collector.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.320]   There are about three or four that have been designated by the IRS.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:39.820]   But again, generally, it's never something where you're asked to do something urgently.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:45.280]   You never get something the IRS is saying, "Unless you pass right now, we're sending
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   someone to arrest you," or even a phone call.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.960]   They don't do that.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:56.480]   You're always offered an opportunity to have a conversation with an agent and reach a settlement
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.020]   agreement with the IRS, for example.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:07.640]   But that's what scams are based on, and a lot of the scams are very similar.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.160]   It's like, think of it as the music is the same, but the lyrics change depending upon
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.440]   what's happening in the world or what the scammer or the hacker is trying to achieve.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:24.540]   So you really need to set a list of protocols for yourself as to what you do, and protocol
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:33.040]   number one, stop, read it carefully, calm down, think about what it's saying, and think
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.060]   about whether or not it's logical that you would have received this communication by
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.680]   way of an email, and whether or not what they're asking you to do seems logical within the
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.440]   timeframe they're giving you to respond.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.480]   Are there any new tactics?
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.100]   I know Sim Swapping made all the news years ago.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.640]   Is there anything happening right now that you know about because you're in the industry
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.380]   that maybe other people will hear about over the next few years, but would be good to know
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.380]   now?
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.820]   Well, let's go through some of the scams that exist and sort of match them to what's going
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.820]   on.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:16.660]   First of all, there are healthcare scams that have been going on forever, but in particular,
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:23.300]   COVID was a petri dish for them, and now monkeypox is becoming a problem as well.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   And that could be anything from updates, to tracking, to notifications, to here's where
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.240]   you get your vaccine, here's where you schedule your test, these kinds of things.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.540]   So you have to be on the lookout for this.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:46.860]   Again, as you said, run your cursor over the email address to make sure that where it's
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.380]   coming from looks legitimate.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.660]   And even then, wherever it's coming from, even if it's a phone call from someone saying
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:01.000]   they're from the health department, thank them, hang up, independently confirm the right
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.820]   number for your county health department or your state health department, or even the
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.540]   CDC, if you think you're getting a call from the CDC, which I really haven't heard of too
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:17.620]   many calls coming from the CDC, and then call the real number and speak to somebody and
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:23.900]   confirm whatever that information that they're providing you.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:30.540]   And remember, in most of these cases, they are never supposed to ask you what your social
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.260]   security number is or getting credit card information from you.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.480]   You can't pay to get to the head of the line with these.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:45.140]   If it's a legitimate government situation and it's involving healthcare, there is a
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:51.300]   protocol to use and in no protocol that I know of and have ever known of, are you paying
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.720]   something in advance in order to advance your prospects with that?
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.940]   So you have health, job scams all the time, especially during the great resignation and
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:09.140]   now with inflation and now with the concerns about whether or not there's going to be a
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.140]   recession.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.700]   You know, people may be looking for additional jobs there.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:20.820]   Go to legitimate, well-vetted websites and make sure that you're communicating with the
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.080]   right organization.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.140]   If someone asks you to provide your social security number right off the bat, that's
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.860]   not legitimate.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   Don't walk, run.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.060]   So this could be a job board, you see a job you're interested in, you're like, "Ooh,
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.060]   this company is interesting.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.580]   Maybe I should apply for it."
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.200]   It could just be a totally a fake company that's leading you down a path of interviewing
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.580]   for a job with the purpose of just collecting information about you.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   Is that...
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.580]   Absolutely.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.580]   Or getting financial information by way of, you know, you giving them your credit card
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.580]   information.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.140]   Let's say it's a secret shopper job and they say, "Well, you know, to get you started,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   you know, we're going to be laying out some money, but we'd like you to sort of reimburse
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.140]   us for this.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.140]   So be careful.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.980]   You don't want to get involved in anything like that unless you can confirm the legitimacy
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   of it."
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.940]   So always independently confirm.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:21.260]   Also confirm that that particular company is actually looking to hire people, which
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:27.540]   you can go by going to the real website of the organization and then calling the HR department
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.740]   of the company and asking them if they're conducting interviews.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.920]   But you have to be very careful about job scams.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.540]   There was a scam that was going around for a while, disappeared, came back again, the
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.900]   jury commission scam.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.780]   That's where you get a phone call, someone represents themselves to be from the jury
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   commission.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:51.700]   They're polling "eligible jurors" in the district, and if you would be so kind as to
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.220]   provide them with your social security number, they'll be able to let you know whether or
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.540]   not you're eligible or not for the jury poll.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:04.740]   There have been scams where police departments were supposedly calling people and asking
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:09.460]   them for specific information.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.020]   Generally police departments just don't call people out of the blue, or if they do, it's
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.740]   a legitimate detective, they may be asking you questions, but they're not going to be
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:24.260]   asking for your social security number, your date of birth, or things like that.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.380]   Unemployment scams, of course, have been a disaster during COVID.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.660]   I mean, billions upon billions of dollars have been stolen.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.100]   My own sister-in-law, who was on one of our episodes, was talking about the fact that
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:42.180]   she was legitimately notified by her home state of Colorado and by the state of Ohio
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.620]   that somebody using her information had applied for unemployment benefits.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:52.740]   In one case, she found out simply because she received a debit card in the mail from
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   the unemployment agency, which she said, "I'm not looking for a job.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.940]   I'm fine.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.060]   I'm not out of work."
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.060]   We've had cases where people found out because someone in their company walked up to their
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:13.940]   desk in the days when people were actually at their desk and said, "By the way, why did
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.300]   you apply for unemployment?
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.340]   You still have a job here."
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.180]   So that was going on.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.500]   You have the tech scams, that's what you get a phone call from someone representing themselves
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.740]   to be from Apple or Microsoft saying that they've noticed that there's a problem with
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:38.900]   your computer, they are going to direct you to a site where you can download certain software,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.860]   which will enable them to then come into your computer and check it out and solve whatever
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.540]   the problem is.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.540]   Apple and Microsoft, they don't do that, but scammers certainly do that.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.900]   So be on the lookout for tech scams.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.920]   Then, of course, in the line of work that you've been talking about too, which is vacations
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:05.340]   and points and all of that, there have been theft of frequent fire miles, there have been
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:12.340]   all kinds of vacation scams, all kinds of rental scams that people have to be on the
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.420]   lookout for, which we can go into further depth if you'd like to do that.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:21.860]   Then there's catfishing, which is huge.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:26.780]   Whatever the theme may be, it's still a catfish.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.140]   What people are trying to do is they're trying to tug on your heartstrings and get you to
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.220]   believe that they care about you, and the whole goal is to get into your life as quickly
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:44.940]   as possible and as authentically as possible, but yet you never really get to see them.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.380]   You never get to really hear them.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:53.300]   You may just be communicating with them by text or by email, and then at some point relatively
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:43:02.980]   quickly into this relationship, you're suddenly asked for a lot of personal information, or
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:09.460]   they send you a compromising picture and ask you to reciprocate, which you don't realize
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:15.620]   that's not their picture, but unfortunately that's your picture you just sent to them,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:22.260]   and suddenly you can become a victim of extortion and blackmail.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.800]   Or they ask you to provide credit card information so that you can help them get a plane ticket
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.500]   to come visit you.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   Or we've had cases.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:36.060]   We had a woman on our show talking about the fact that she met someone online who even
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:43.160]   had a terrific LinkedIn profile as a very successful medical professional who had decided
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.900]   to dedicate part of his life to go to the Mideast and then open a clinic there, and
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.980]   somewhere in the first couple weeks that they were getting to know each other, he said,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.740]   "You know, our equipment has come in.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.660]   It's held up by customs at the airport.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.180]   If there's any way that you could help me by sending me $30,000 so I can get the equipment
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.460]   out, that would be great."
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.460]   Of course, she didn't do it.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.900]   She wouldn't fall for it, but unfortunately a lot of people do.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:17.860]   I mean, we've seen cases where someone was taken to the tune of $2 million by someone
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.740]   who convinced them that he loved them.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.900]   And the only way that they found out there was something wrong, which they should have
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:33.220]   known from the beginning, but was that a financial advisor notified members of their family and
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.580]   said, "Something's going on with your mom.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.360]   She's taking a lot of money out and sending it overseas.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.140]   You really need to look into this."
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:47.700]   And even after confronted with the reality of her situation, she said, "Okay, I understand
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.380]   it's a fraud, but in my heart, I still love him."
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:55.620]   I mean, this is how deeply they ingrain themselves into your life.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:02.260]   And then another scam, and I won't go on forever, but another scam are charity scams.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.780]   And this is where they'll take the issue of the day, whether it's the Ukraine, it's a
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.860]   natural disaster, it's a crisis somewhere in the world, it's children.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.300]   Any one of those topics, whatever is in the news, they will use it.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:23.200]   They will convince you that they are the newest, best, most successful, most respected organization
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.980]   in the space.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.180]   And could you please give them credit card information or send money to this?
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.640]   And it's not real, it's a fraud.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   That's really interesting.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.140]   So I've been a little familiar with some, not all the others.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.300]   When it comes to the frequent flyer miles thing, if you Google my name, there's some
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.340]   articles about having a lot of points in miles.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:53.300]   And so I have been a victim of, I guess, theft of points, I guess, which we talked about
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.060]   maybe coming on your show.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.300]   And if that happens, definitely go check it out.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   I'll tell the full story.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   Absolutely.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.300]   Absolutely.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.420]   But in short, it led me to...
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.660]   That's what set me down a path of really locking down all these accounts, because someone was
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:16.460]   able to call Chase and get Chase to let them order things with points on the internet.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:21.000]   The craziest thing, and I have still today don't understand it, was they ordered an Apple
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.140]   laptop using my points, but they shipped it to my house.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:29.900]   Now, maybe the plan was to come to my house and kind of pick it up, but they never did.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.900]   And I just...
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.540]   An Apple laptop showed up.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:38.980]   So it was like the strangest fraud, because Chase refunded the points and I had a laptop.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.640]   I asked Chase what they wanted me to do with it.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.900]   And they said, "Try to take it to the Apple store."
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.340]   The Apple store didn't want it.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.660]   So eventually, Chase said, "The best thing we can tell you is to keep it or donate it.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.380]   We don't know what to do."
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.020]   Which ended up being a happy story for me, but it was probably payback for the hours
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.760]   of time to mitigate it.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.580]   Which comes back to...
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:06.100]   I want to go back to your first M, which is about minimizing the risk and talk about some
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:12.820]   of the things people can be doing to prepare and plan in advance of any of this happening.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.180]   There's a couple areas here I'll go to, but one is around information online.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:22.460]   So I remember back when I was a venture capitalist, this company Fortalice, which I know you're
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:28.580]   familiar with, was raising money and they offered to run some reports on people in the
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.700]   investing group to show off their product.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.000]   And they ran this report and I was like, "Wow."
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.040]   It's not that I didn't know there was information about me online.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.200]   There's family tree websites, there's white page websites, there's my social media.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.280]   But when someone pulls all that information together into one place, and you see a list
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.020]   of every address you've ever lived at, every job you've had, all of your phone numbers,
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:55.820]   all of your email addresses, and then the exact same set of information for your spouse,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.580]   your siblings, your parents, and they put it all together, you're just a little bit
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.960]   taken aback.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.020]   And it made me think, "Gosh, should I be getting rid of this?"
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:13.280]   Is there a way that consumers can just get a lot of this information off the internet?
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.700]   Or what goes into trying to mitigate this risk and minimize the risk and getting stuff
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   taken away?
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:25.340]   Well, I could give you my favorite George Carlin line, which it's a mystery, but the
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:33.980]   truth is that there are things that can be done, but it is a long and arduous and time
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.980]   consuming process.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:43.340]   Because you literally have to go from data broker to data broker and there are procedures
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:48.560]   you can use, and each one explains it to you, and of course the CFPB, Consumer Financial
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:54.940]   Protection Bureau, has advice on exactly how to do all of that.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:02.340]   But just like when LifeLock started and someone said, "Well, isn't it true that a lot of this
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.020]   stuff people can do themselves?"
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:10.140]   And the answer, which I thought was a very interesting answer, and I've been a fan of
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:16.940]   LifeLock, is they said, "Well, sure, you can also change your own oil, and if you want
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.300]   you could maybe even change your own muffler.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.340]   Do you want to?"
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   So it really has to do with how much time you're willing to dedicate to it.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:33.100]   Some people, it's a crusade, and they will do it because they don't want to pay anyone
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.340]   else to do it, and they will do it.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:41.780]   Others will find companies like reputation.com, which is where they will work to get negative
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:49.900]   information about you offline, or companies like Abine, where they will work with you
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:56.420]   to actually delete information from the online world.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:03.460]   And now that there is a right to forget in the GDPR, which is the General Data Protection
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:09.780]   Regulation in Europe, and it's incorporated to some extent in the California Consumer
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:19.180]   Protection Act, and it is hoped that maybe it will be also incorporated in the American
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.540]   Data Protection Act, which is kind of wending its way through Congress, assuming it can
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:28.060]   actually find its way through Congress, which is very difficult for us.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:33.160]   As we've seen in the past years, it's very difficult for stuff to get through Congress
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:38.340]   while the interest is involved, but it still is a process.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.860]   Now, you can contact Google, for instance, and ask them to remove certain information
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.420]   about you, which they're willing to do, but it's a process.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:52.460]   And even if, you know, this is just like with a credit report, when people would go to credit
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:58.420]   repair companies, and some of them are good, and some of them are really, really not good,
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:05.260]   and they would say, "Okay, we will get this information off," and they do, but unfortunately,
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:13.420]   it was legitimate information, and as a result, when the particular subscribing retailer does
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:19.700]   an update, the information finds itself back onto your credit report again.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:28.180]   So, you know, think of all of the millions of websites that are out there, and how, unfortunately,
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:35.700]   over the years, there's been this wholesale sharing of information, or selling information,
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:42.880]   or lending information, depending upon what the relationship was between these organizations,
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.740]   and it's going to be out there.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.940]   And yeah, can you get it off, maybe, for a period of time?
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.240]   Can you get it everywhere?
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:56.700]   It may take you forever to find out where everywhere is, and there's a new part of everywhere
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.220]   that shows up every day.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:05.260]   So that's why you have to say to yourself, "Look, the world I live in, it's a surveillance
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.260]   economy."
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.740]   It just is.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:15.860]   We are surrounded by billions of Internet of Things devices, tracking, listening, sending
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:21.440]   data back to manufacturers, data then being shared, that information also being hacked
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.100]   by hackers.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.260]   So that's why you need to really consider the three M's.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.140]   And among the things you should be doing, assuming that your data is out there, even
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:39.820]   despite your best efforts to get it off the online world, is everything from long and
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:46.700]   strong passwords, not shared among websites or password managers, using two-factor authentication,
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:54.020]   which makes it, again, more difficult for someone to represent that they are you, because
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:59.100]   they do have to go through that extra layer of whether a code is sent to a cell phone,
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:11.660]   or you use biotech, not biotech, but you're using thumbprints, eye scans, depending upon
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.380]   the particular device you're using.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.200]   I'm a particular fan of thumbprints.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.100]   They also, multi-factor authentication can involve voice prints.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:26.300]   Of course, the issue is what if, God forbid, someone steals a database of a company where
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.660]   they have your voice prints, that could be a problem, too.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.980]   But again, any layer of additional authentication you can add is important.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.420]   It also means you don't click on every link you see.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.820]   You don't open every attachment, even if you think it's coming from someone you know.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:49.940]   I mean, a perfect example, it's a buzzkill, but any time I get an e-card from someone,
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:55.060]   the first thing I do is I call that person and say, "I know this is a buzzkill, but did
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.060]   you just send...
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.340]   You don't have to tell me what it says.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.900]   I'll go do it, provided you confirm you really did it."
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:07.740]   But again, with the malware that's out there and the ransomware attacks that are going
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:14.340]   on, you always run the risk that someone you know receives something that they opened that
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:19.300]   they thought was hysterically funny and terrific, and they're sending it to you, but they didn't
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:25.400]   realize that it had malware on it, and all they've done is they've shared the love and
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.340]   the hack with you.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.440]   So you do run that risk.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.920]   That's why it's really important to be very careful where you click, what you open.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.660]   That means, as we talked about earlier, you lie like a superhero when you're sending up
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.500]   questions and answers.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:47.580]   That means that you freeze your credit, which is, as we talked about, is free and you can
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.580]   do it.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:55.140]   It means that even the humble shredder, and I don't mean a ribbon cut shredder, because
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:03.620]   for those of us who saw Argo, as an example, what happens is you can get kids or people
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:10.060]   hopped up on drugs who will sit there and meticulously tape back up things that have
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.660]   been cut by a ribbon cut shredder.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:18.180]   That's why you need a confetti cut shredder or a cross cut shredder, which turns this
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:25.300]   into little useless pieces of confetti that no one can put back together again.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.460]   So these are some of the things that you need to think about doing.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:37.140]   Or as we also talked about earlier, that's where the third M comes in, and it's so important,
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:45.300]   and that is to contact your insurance agent, your financial services rep, or the HR department
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.100]   where you work and say, "If I become a victim of an identity incident, or if I'm worried
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.980]   about it, or I find out that an organization that I've had a relationship with has been
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.860]   hacked, are you going to help me through the incident?"
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.100]   And that's where it's really important.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:09.580]   And a lot of these programs are free, deeply discounted, and worth you signing up for.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:14.460]   I'll share a couple others that I've learned in the past, I don't know how many years,
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.980]   that some I've employed, some I plan to.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.180]   I actually have multiple email addresses.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.340]   So I have an email address that I just use for financial institutions.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.020]   I have never shared that email with anyone.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.700]   Only financial institutions know it.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:34.700]   I've been recommended, though I haven't, to use a separate one for social media profiles.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.700]   Yes.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.300]   That was another recommendation, is to just have different email addresses.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.740]   Look, if you don't have a password manager, I can only imagine how hard that is.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.980]   So we're going to go back to your original recommendation, which is everyone needs a
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.980]   password manager.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:51.380]   Everyone should be using two-factor authentication everywhere they can.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.780]   And you can use Google Authenticator.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:57:00.500]   You can use some of the more, the hardware-oriented, you know, when we talked earlier, you had
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.420]   mentioned one of them, when we talked prior to that.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:10.220]   I'm a fan of all of my two-factor being one-time passwords that you can put in Google Authenticator,
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.420]   or Authy, or even 1Password.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:18.460]   Though I had historically been putting all of my one-time passwords in 1Password, I am
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:23.580]   now realizing, as convenient as it is for them to copy and paste them, the fact that
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:29.540]   I'm storing my password in the exact same place I'm storing my two-factor Auth inherently
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.860]   makes it no longer two-factor, because they're in the same place.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   So that's the...
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   That's like 1A factor.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.940]   So it's, yeah, I got two types of single-factor.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.460]   So I'll probably actually be changing that.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:47.700]   Do you have an opinion on using security keys versus, you know, like hardware, Yubico, plug-in
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.900]   security keys versus a Google Authenticator and Authy app?
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.900]   Well, you know, there are some people that like it, that like using security keys, but
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:02.300]   they're generally one-account related keys, as I believe.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.460]   Yubico may be more than that, but I think it is one.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:14.020]   Oh, so my Yubico key, I actually, I use it with Facebook, and with Google, and with different
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.020]   services.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.020]   So I can sign into different services.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.020]   Oh, good.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.020]   All right.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.020]   I just, it's such...
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140]   It's not...
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.620]   It's a lot more hassle to have to carry this thing around and plug it in.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:27.420]   Obviously that comes with security, but it's just one where I'm like, I haven't quite determined
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   that it's worth it.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.240]   Well, that's like, yeah, because that's the issue is that, you know, you may carry it
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.020]   with you, but then if one day it disappears, it's not helpful to you.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.020]   Just keep in mind, if you're using Google Authenticator, you lose your phone, you lose
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.020]   those passwords.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.900]   Obviously, you can usually recover them with backup codes.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.620]   I definitely recommend writing down those backup codes or using something like Authy,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.620]   which is a competitor.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.460]   But I know they actually store those so you can transfer them between devices.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:56.500]   There might be better services.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:01.080]   If anyone listening has, by the way, if anyone listening here has any recommendations that
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:05.660]   we didn't cover or anything, please send them to me because I'm actually, hopefully between
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.940]   now and the time this airs, I'm going to try to put a lot of these into place, test a lot
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.520]   of these services out, and maybe release another little bonus episode with my feedback from
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.940]   trying to do all of this.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.420]   Oh, no, that would be great.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:22.340]   Just remember, whenever you write down something, put it in some place secure.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.900]   You always run the risk if you, you know, use a post-it on your computer and someone
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.260]   breaks in your house, you've just given away another key to the kingdom.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.260]   So.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.260]   Yep.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   I think I'm actually going to try.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:39.180]   Well, another tip someone gave me is actually not just emailing these white pages directories
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.180]   online.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.560]   So, you know, if you just Google your name or your last name and your address in quotes,
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.980]   you'll see the websites that are sharing your address.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.040]   You can reach out to them and get them to remove things.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.840]   A friend of mine recently told me another suggestion, which is to reach out to the MLS
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:59.640]   and have all of the, or have your real estate agent do it and have the photos of the house
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.560]   that you purchased whenever it was removed from the MLS.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.700]   Otherwise someone has your address.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:10.100]   They can also then just go look inside your house, understand the entire floor plan.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.260]   You know, I'm not saying you're a target of someone understanding the layout of your house,
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:19.200]   but it seems like information that provides very little value to the world for people
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.540]   to be able to look inside every room of your house.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.520]   Obviously it's not real time, it's not your cameras, but yeah, so that's something I'm
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   going to be doing.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   No, that's important.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.240]   The other thing is you can actually contact like Google and Apple and say, could you blur
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:41.920]   my house so that if someone's using maps or whatever, that they can blur it so it's not
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.000]   so easy to go, "Oh, I see.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   That's where Chris lives.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Hmm.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.200]   I didn't realize he was as close as he is."
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:58.160]   So these are little tricks of the trade that you can do as well that is another step toward
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.040]   helping you get your stuff offline, or at least less accessible.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   I'm trying to think of any other ones that I've done or have thought about.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:14.960]   I have a second phone number on Google Voice that if you're using, unfortunately, I don't
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.600]   know why, but it seems like every financial institution supports only text message or
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.920]   phone call-based two-factor auth.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:30.200]   All of the tech companies seem to support using authenticator and one-time passwords,
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:37.860]   but all of my financial institutions, Chase, Vanguard, they're only text, and it's so frustrating.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.800]   So I've got my Google Voice number that I can use.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.120]   So I'm not using the number that I've given out to so many people, as you mentioned earlier.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   No.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.280]   Listen, that's an excellent idea, is Google Voice for calls, so that if you leave...
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.120]   Because as we talked about, the ubiquity of your cell phone number, it's always good to
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.760]   have another phone number.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.360]   Another scam that was going on is the Google Voice scam, and that's where you're supposedly
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.160]   doing business with someone online.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.200]   They go, "Well, I don't really know if I can trust you.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.920]   So I want to know that you're the real you, that this is really your phone number.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:25.560]   So I'm going to send you a code, and then I want you to read me back the code."
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:32.680]   What they've actually done is they've applied for a Google Voice number using your phone
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:41.960]   as the point of authentication, and then they will have a code sent to you.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.080]   And then they will ask you to read them the code, and that then enables them to contact
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.120]   Google Voice and represent themselves as if they're you.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:56.680]   I've seen the same thing happen with sending an iCloud two-factor code.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.400]   They just pretend that it's something else.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.160]   They say, "Oh, I want to confirm it's your identity.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   Let me send you a code."
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.520]   And they go to Apple, and they go in and say, "Recover my password, send a code," and they
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.880]   just hope that you don't notice that that code actually is from Apple, or that code
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.160]   is from your bank, or something like that.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.320]   So I'd say, if you're not dealing with a service where you're 100% sure it's the service,
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.400]   which means you called them.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.360]   If Verizon calls you and says, "Hey, we'd love to talk to you about your account.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.120]   We're going to send you a code right now, and then we can get in," I would say, "Thank
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.720]   you, but let me call 611 back and get a Verizon rep before proceeding."
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.360]   That goes into the category of, "No, no, no, no, no."
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   Yes, exactly.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.840]   A couple of quick questions just on the computer, while we're browsing the internet.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.920]   Now that HTTPS is pretty ubiquitous, right?
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.840]   I think if you're not listening, or sorry, you're listening.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.040]   If you don't already know to look for the secure lock, most browsers will throw off
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.000]   errors if they're not there.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Do VPNs really matter in these days?
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.420]   I know I've heard plenty of ads for them, but I wonder if now that almost everything
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:13.680]   we do online is HTTPS, if having a VPN really provides a lot of value other than maybe like
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.600]   your browsing activity, what types of things you're doing, whether you're streaming from
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   different services.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.840]   Well, a VPN also is very helpful when you're, let's say you're connecting to your business
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840]   network.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   Sure, sure.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   It's always good to use it.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:33.160]   If your company has a VPN to get access things, yes, but the idea of, oh, if you're at a public
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.120]   Wi-Fi spot, you need a VPN to make sure people aren't stealing your information.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.640]   My understanding is that with HTTPS being so prolific and secure certificates being
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.240]   free, that that's not really a thing people need to be worried about.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.600]   Well, the only issue is that there have been cases of the secure certificates being stolen.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.560]   As a result, a VPN is still a good way to go.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.000]   I like DuckDuckGo, but there were people that will say to you that if you're going to get
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.600]   a VPN, use one you pay for because they're less likely to sell your information than
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:20.720]   ones that one day might share your information that are free.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:27.360]   That goes back to another thing too, which is read privacy policies and understand what
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.920]   the privacy policy is, terms and conditions.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.520]   Now I realize privacy policies in many cases are written in 27th grade English and they're
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.680]   presented to you in mouse print, and there are translators where you can actually go
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:48.520]   and it'll translate what a privacy policy is.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.440]   The name of some of them escapes me right now, but this is something we could talk to
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.520]   Travis about, for example, that he might be able to give information on that.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:07.240]   Again, anything that you can do to mask your identity is a good thing because just even
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:17.680]   something as simple as location services on your mobile device, many websites now scramble
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:23.760]   the things that would be identified by location services, but many of them don't.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.320]   The last thing you want is you're publishing pictures and it shows when and where the picture
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.560]   was taken, especially if it involves people doing things they shouldn't do, like exposing
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.800]   their kids too much to people.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:46.200]   Like an example, here we are at Sustance Hutchin Park and it's little Susie's second birthday,
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:53.120]   and if the location services are on and it's not a site that scrambles them, the issue
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:07:00.000]   you have is that somebody could show up one day at that park, find little Susie, and say,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.640]   "I feel so terrible that I missed your birthday, and I told mommy that I'd be over the park
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.040]   today to see you because I have a present for you.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.800]   If you just come with me over there, it's in my car."
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.720]   Then all of a sudden, you have a missing child.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:27.000]   Location services, you should be discreet about when you use them, where you use them,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.160]   and if you can disable them, you do it.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.160]   Of course, I realize that your GPS system won't work in a few of them.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.240]   So turn them on for that, but be careful.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.360]   Know that they can come back to haunt you.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.920]   When I got that Fortalis report, they looked at all the photos that had been published
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.760]   on social media by me, by others, around my home address, and all of a sudden there are
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.560]   photos that you didn't know of your friends and your family inside your house and all
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.120]   that kind of stuff.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:01.120]   One of their recommendations was to go back and remove the geo tags from your photos from
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.400]   everything you've posted online.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:09.800]   The only other thing that we didn't discuss from tips that I have are going in and doing
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.520]   an audit of things you've authed to your Google account or your Twitter account or your Facebook
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.080]   account.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.520]   There are so many websites that say, "Oh, just auth your Gmail," or, "Oh, just auth
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.480]   your Facebook," and some of them, many of them are legitimate, right?
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.200]   I authed my Gmail to Calendly so I can schedule meetings.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.920]   But doing an audit every so often of, are there services that you've given access to
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.800]   your email or to your social media profiles that you don't use anymore?
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   Or even, I noticed that recently, I can't remember what service it was, but it's gotten
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800]   a lot better, right?
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.040]   It used to be all or nothing authentication.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.800]   Some of them now say, "What do you want to give information?
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.440]   Do you want to give your name, or do you want to give your email, or do you want to give
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.680]   full control to post, delete, and see everything?"
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.120]   And if you authenticated something five years ago, you might not have had the fine-grained
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.200]   detail to be able to choose what you give access to.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.280]   So it could even be worth deleting all of them and redoing them to make sure that you're
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.240]   only authenticating the kinds of information you want to the parties you want.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.520]   You're not wrong about that one at all.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.760]   And you absolutely should do an audit because it's very important to figure out when you're
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.520]   on a particular site, where your information is going.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.160]   I have a good friend who has a new company that he started, which is a privacy company.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:39.720]   And what they do is they can scan a website and then show you all of the different places
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.960]   that your data is going, all the different companies that are sucking up your data that
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.560]   you had no idea.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.440]   And by data, just to be clear, it's usually IP address and activity, not stealing information
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.600]   off your computer and your files and that kind of stuff.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   Right.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.760]   But it's still IP address you can identify.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:09.000]   And they once proved, many years ago, they did someone, they were able to identify specifically
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.720]   who they were through analyzing their AOL searches.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.860]   And they were able to actually zero in on the individual.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:27.680]   And today people will tell you, give me two or three social media entries and one receipt,
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.400]   and I'll be able to tell you who and where.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   Yep.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.200]   I remember I worked at a company that was dealing with location data and we were talking
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.040]   to a cell phone carrier and you might not know that just from the towers you're on on
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.520]   your cell phone, the cell phone carriers are logging all of this data.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.800]   And unfortunately at the time, maybe not now, they're willing to sell this data.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.480]   It doesn't have anything to do with you.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.800]   It's just, there is a device, it's here, but no one knows who.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.720]   But I remember we did some analysis and it was something like, with a reasonable degree
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.480]   of accuracy, you could figure out where any given phone would be at any given time because
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.920]   you had the history of where it had been.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.520]   Now, thankfully that information was anonymous to the person.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:16.400]   But if you said, you could say this phone that's often at this address is likely to
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.160]   be here.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   It was just, it was a little too much.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.000]   I don't want to get people too scared though.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.240]   You could listen to this and say, oh my gosh, my kids are going to get abducted.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   People are going to find me.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.040]   They're going to see everything in my house.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.400]   What message do you have to people that are maybe will help them get out of that feeling
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.920]   of leaving this thinking everything's coming to an end, I should turn off all my technology
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.280]   and never leave the home?
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.120]   Well, interestingly enough, I've had someone say, well, thank you, Adam, now that I've
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.560]   listened to you, you speak, I'm going home, I'm going to disconnect everything, I'm going
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.400]   to burn off my fingerprints and I'm going to hide under my mattress.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.600]   I said, but you can't do that.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.480]   I mean, unless you're living under a bottle cap at the bottom of Loon Lake and you're
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.080]   completely off the grid, which nobody is, you're out there.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:12.160]   So the question is just be alert, know what the threats are, know what the red flags are
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.400]   and then practice, for example, the three Ms.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.760]   Do everything you can to minimize your risk of exposure.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.580]   Like for example, when you get a new internet of things device, which most things are these
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.660]   days, change the password.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:37.420]   Most of them come with manufactured default passwords and probably 98% of those passwords
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.640]   are for sale on the dark web.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.680]   So change the password to something long and strong.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.240]   Just read the manual, it'll tell you how to do it.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.200]   Just like when you get your router in, make sure that the password is what you want it
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.680]   to be, not what someone else wants it to be and make it as complex as possible or use
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.680]   a password manager to help you with the whole thing.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.120]   It's really all about two things that people have to understand.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.620]   Number one, we all have day jobs.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.640]   We work, we raise families, we're involved in educational activities, philanthropic activities,
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.760]   we own companies, we're busy.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.560]   That keeps us excited, interested, but also diverted.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.240]   To a hacker who's not diverted, we are their day job.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.600]   This is what they do.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.640]   Some countries, they come in at eight, they have their lunch break, they go home at 4.30
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.700]   or five o'clock in the afternoon, and it's a job and they're working for the government.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.920]   That's how they raise money.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.280]   That's how they conduct espionage.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.640]   Others work around the clock and do what they do.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.160]   But it is their day job.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:58.700]   The second thing to understand is when you look in the mirror, you see you and you go,
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.440]   why would anyone in the world want to steal my identity?
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.440]   Why would anyone care?
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.320]   The answer is simple.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.600]   You see you, but when they see you, a hacker, a scammer, an identity thief, they see Jay-Z,
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.860]   Beyonce, Adam Levine.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:23.400]   They see somebody who's got something they want that can enrich their lives.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.780]   This is not to offend anyone.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:33.040]   It's not you they're after, but it's your spouse, your child, your parent, an organization
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.520]   that you're involved with, a company that you work for, and you are simply the conduit
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.860]   to get them to whoever or wherever they want to get to.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:48.840]   This is why it's extremely important that you really focus on cyber hygiene.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:54.260]   Just like you go to doctors, you go to dentists, you do things that you do to stay healthy,
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:02.200]   you have to maintain a healthy cyber environment because you're protecting yourself, your family,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.860]   possibly your company, your coworkers, and millions of innocent consumers that may be
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.440]   doing business with your company.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.120]   There was a concept that was raised a couple years ago by the CEO of Microsoft, and I think
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   he was dead right.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.320]   It's called shared responsibility.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.900]   It's that we know that business hasn't done enough.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.020]   We know that government hasn't done enough, and we know consumers haven't done enough
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.980]   to protect each and every one of us from the ravages of cyber issues or identity theft
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.540]   or ransomware.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.500]   Each of us has a role to play.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.500]   With consumers, we didn't ask for it.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.580]   We're not trained for it.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:48.180]   It's certainly not something we want, but it's a reality of where we are, what we do,
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.580]   who we are, and the world we live in.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:56.360]   Therefore, it's incumbent upon each and every one of us to do our part because we could
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:02.820]   be protecting a whole lot more people than just ourselves by doing the right thing when
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.620]   it comes to cybersecurity.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:10.300]   It's not something that you need to be terrified of because it's reality.
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.480]   You're not going to escape it.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.340]   As a result, it's a question of, just like they say with COVID, we got to live with it.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.180]   When it comes to cybersecurity, we have to live with it.
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.580]   It is not an individual sport.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:23.980]   It is a group sport.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.700]   It's a team.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.220]   In addition to which, you can't take a victory lap for cybersecurity because you could be
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:37.460]   completely secure at 9 o'clock in the morning and suddenly exposed at 9.01 because somebody
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.980]   clicked the wrong link, opened the wrong attachment, gave the wrong information to somebody.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:48.540]   If we stick together, work with each other, collaborate, communicate, cooperate, we're
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.140]   going to be better off for it.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.260]   I think there's a much more collegial attitude now that it comes to cybersecurity than ever
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:56.260]   before.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.980]   Like you said earlier, with all the information out there, it's only a matter of time before
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.020]   someone decides to pick you as a target.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   That's right.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   You win the lottery.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020]   One you didn't even enter.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:13.180]   Yeah, but I'd say if you can make yourself a harder target by doing a lot of the stuff
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:17.140]   we talked about today, then you just move yourself further and further down that list
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:21.340]   where someone says, "Ah, this person's information isn't very easy to find online.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:25.420]   Let's just skip to the next person where their address takes me a second to find."
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.100]   It's like the whole issue, if you're a burglar, do you break into the house where there's
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.460]   no dog or one where there is a dog where you might not be sure that you're going to come
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.780]   out with both legs?
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:45.100]   It's important to do that and a very important rule of thumb, anytime that anybody contacts
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:53.180]   you about anything and asks you to authenticate yourself for any reason, however plausible
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.620]   or logical it is, hang up.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:04.060]   It's one thing if you contact them and they're an organization trying to do the right thing
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:10.980]   and they're asking you to authenticate yourself, but if they contact you, no good.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.580]   Great parting advice.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.740]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:18.940]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're learning, all of the latest conversations
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   you're having?
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:28.180]   Well, come to adamlevin.com, which is where we put a lot of information about the newest,
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:33.540]   scariest, maybe not so scary, but things you need to know.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.600]   We have that on the website.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.100]   Come to What the Hack with Adam Levin.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:43.340]   You can get it anywhere you get your podcasts.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:47.700]   Think of it as car talk for cyber.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.700]   There are three of us.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.500]   We try to have a lot of fun with it.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.280]   We focus on a lot of important issues.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.500]   We bring people on who have either been victimized or have managed to avoid victimization when
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.540]   it comes to cyber or identity theft, and there are a lot of lessons to learn.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:10.100]   The whole thing is that this is where scaring is caring and sharing is caring, is that the
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:16.020]   more people that are willing to tell their stories about what they went through and what
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.180]   the red flags were and how to avoid it, the better it is for you.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   We all gain.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.500]   Well, I'm looking forward to joining you and talking about the fact that people always
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.820]   overlook their frequent flyer accounts.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:33.180]   I think, "Let's lock down my bank account," but especially for this audience, you build
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.700]   up credit card points, you build up miles.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.100]   To have someone go in and take a flight or drain them to buy a computer is the worst,
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.100]   and I've dealt with it.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.940]   No, it's not fair.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.620]   You did the work to get it.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:49.140]   Why should somebody get the benefit of your effort?
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.380]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.700]   I really appreciate it, and I enjoyed the conversation.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.580]   Well, thanks for inviting me.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   I enjoyed it very much.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   Let's do it again.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.320]   - Thank you very much, let's do it again.
