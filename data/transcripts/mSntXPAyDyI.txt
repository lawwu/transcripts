[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.340]   A female podcast listener in Colorado writes in to ask this. "Hello Pastor John, with a heavy heart I ask.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.300]   First, what does Paul mean in Ephesians 5 verses 11 and 12 that instead of taking part in the unfruitful works of darkness,
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.500]   we're supposed to expose them? Is this talking about unfruitful works that others are committing against the Lord or our own?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.900]   Second, if someone was claiming Christ and his gospel, leading in the church, yet living in sexual sin,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.680]   are we supposed to do something about that?" What would you say Pastor John?"
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.400]   The short answer to each of those questions is one,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.640]   exposing the works of darkness in Ephesians 5 11 refers to the works of others, not your own.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920]   And two,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.040]   yes,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.520]   leaders who are living in sexual sin should be brought into the light and dealt with in a biblical way.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.840]   So those are the two answers. Now, what we need to do is to put those answers
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   in the context of Paul's instruction about exposing darkness.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.000]   The context is important because it shows the way that we expose the darkness is by being
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.400]   children of the light. That's the first thing it shows.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.920]   So if you take the context, Ephesians 5 7 following, it goes like this, "Do not become partakers with them,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:39.200]   for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.920]   for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true, and
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.680]   try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.960]   unfruitful works of darkness, but instead," and then comes the phrase, "expose them,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.720]   for it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret, but when anything is exposed," same word, "by the light,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.640]   it becomes visible." So the first way to think about what Paul is saying is that Christians,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.640]   by the light, by the purity and love and beauty and Christ's
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.800]   brightening
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   demonstrations of their lives,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.200]   inevitably cause the darkness of those around them to be more obvious. I think that's the main thing Paul's saying.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.760]   We see this
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.360]   every time someone gets converted, and we see it in the Bible in 1 Peter 4 3, where it says, "For the time that has
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.160]   passed suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, lawless idolatries."
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.200]   With respect to this, they are surprised
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.960]   when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.520]   In other words, the very brightness of the new life of
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.040]   the believers is
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.400]   what exposed the darkness.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.200]   Paul intends for that to happen when he says, "Expose them."
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.240]   So the lion's share of our lives is not devoted to passing judgments on all the sinners around us, but rather
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.840]   living such lives of God-centered purity that darkness—
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.040]   the darkness
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.880]   specifically of God-neglect and impurity—will just naturally be
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.360]   shown to be darkness, will be exposed. Here's another example of the natural way it happens in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.520]   where it says, "If everybody prophesies," so a picture of some kind of
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.440]   gathering of Christians, and people are sharing the word back and forth in spirit-anointed ways, "If everybody's prophesying, and an
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.920]   unbeliever or an outsider comes in, he is," and here comes the word, it's translated
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.120]   "convicted," but it's the same word as Ephesians 5:11, "exposed."
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   He's convicted and exposed by all, and he's called to account by all. The secrets of his heart are
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.700]   disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is among you. Beautiful.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.360]   So again,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.000]   the exposure or the conviction that happens is indirect
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.120]   rather than direct. In other words, it's the way the Word of God was being used in the service
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.360]   that brought the exposure of the darkness and the repentance.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   So,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.000]   one last thing on the leaders issue. She wants to know now, what about
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.480]   leaders? And Paul is so helpful here. He's not always crystal clear here,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.760]   but he is so helpful, because that word, "expose them," is
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   precisely the word used to
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.280]   expose an elder caught in sin. So let me read that. This is 1 Timothy 5,
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.000]   19 and 20. "Do not admit a charge against an elder
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.120]   except on the evidence of two or three witnesses." Now, that's a warning to the church not to willy-nilly
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   spread negative things about an elder or to pay attention to one person without more than one person.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.000]   But here's the key verse, verse 20. "As for those elders who persist in sin,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.560]   expose them," or it's translated, "rebuke them," same word,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.920]   "expose them in the presence of all,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.280]   so that the rest may stand in fear."
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.000]   So, if someone was claiming Christ and his gospel, leading in the church,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.120]   yet living in sexual sin, are we supposed to do something about that? The answer is a
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.520]   resounding "yes"
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.240]   from the Bible. Now, how you go about
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.360]   exposing something you have discovered will depend in part on
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.840]   the nature of the relationship you have with the person caught in
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.200]   sin, and I would say the closer the relationship, the more
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.560]   personal and private the initial rebukes and exposures will be. But
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.680]   since it's a leader who's
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.920]   involved, it cannot remain
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:42.440]   private or merely personal because there are too many other people's lives at stake.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.640]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question.

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   Tomorrow we have a question from a man who has a lifelong question on his mind. His childhood friend who loved the Lord and respected his
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.560]   parents
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.900]   died young. Doesn't this prove God's word to be false or unreliable?
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.300]   And it's a heavy question, and it's on the table tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.380]   You
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.380]   You
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.340]   You
