[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   two days ago,
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.580]   Oh, here we go.
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.080]   in the Piazzetta,
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.300]   I got into a fight.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.240]   You got into a fight?
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.460]   I got into a fight.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.840]   Like a physical altercation?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   A physical altercation.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.980]   Really?
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.820]   This chick shows up
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.360]   wearing a white wife beater
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.120]   talking all kinds of shit.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.040]   And I said,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.740]   listen, lady,
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.720]   you zip it.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.100]   And she just kept
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.180]   jawing and jawing.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.080]   And here she is again.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.980]   She's back for more.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.960]   And so I was like,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.500]   listen!
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.940]   Now, have you ever seen
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.380]   Have you ever seen
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.520]   a onesie wife beater?
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.300]   Look at that little sweetie.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.680]   Aw.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.200]   And you just sit there.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.760]   And then you just sit there.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.860]   And then look.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.180]   There's your cold open, everybody.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.480]   That's the good stuff right there.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.920]   Say hi to everybody.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   I know I'm not a beagle.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.040]   I know I'm not a beagle,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.920]   but I'm even better.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.020]   I have my own thoughts.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.700]   Sax, what you're seeing here
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.100]   is called affection
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.420]   between a parent and a child.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.640]   Just let me know when it's over.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.660]   Just let me know when it's over.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.520]   You're the worst.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.660]   You're the worst human being
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.780]   in the world.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.200]   I don't need to watch
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.920]   Jamaat Boost's Q rating
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.760]   by using his kids as props, okay?
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.840]   Oh, Freeburg,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.640]   where's your puppy
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.420]   that you saved
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.400]   from being tortured
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.620]   with Kim Kardashian's lip gloss?
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.820]   Nick, we gotta get this guy in
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.460]   because he hasn't been
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.320]   in the show in a while.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   There he is.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.400]   There he is.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.140]   Aw, Monty.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.780]   Aw, your belly rub.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.320]   Get the props out of the shot.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.880]   We're doing all this
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.120]   to let your winners ride.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.020]   Rain Man, David Sacks.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.880]   I'm doing all this
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.640]   and it's said
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.200]   we open source it to the fans
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.780]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.380]   Love you guys.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.080]   I'm the queen of Kinwa.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.900]   I'm doing all this
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.380]   Sax, what's up with J.D. Vance in Ohio?
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.740]   Is he gonna pull this thing off
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.520]   or is he getting beat up?
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.840]   I read an article about him
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.720]   getting beat up
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.680]   with the Peter Thiel connection being...
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.820]   He got physically beat up?
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   No, no, no, like in the polls.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.660]   No, no, no, no.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.960]   No, I think J.D. should win.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.040]   He's gonna win, right?
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.300]   And what about Blake Masters?
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.480]   These are the two guys
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.100]   that Thiel is backing.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.200]   Should we start the show?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.560]   We kind of did, yeah.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   Can I just ask you a question?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.860]   If any of us entered porn,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.760]   wouldn't one of our names
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.200]   be Blake Masters?
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.980]   Like, it's just,
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.000]   wouldn't it be on the list?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   Like, doesn't it sound like a great...
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.100]   Now you can't even see it.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   Isn't it a great name for porn?
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.460]   It's a great name, Blake Masters.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.600]   It's a great name.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.180]   And J.D. Steele.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.880]   I'm sorry, Vance.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.660]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.620]   Explain what's going on
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.160]   with this mentoring candidate.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.240]   J.D., what would you accuse him of
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.080]   without any evidence?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.600]   I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.180]   I'm just saying,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.960]   tell us about your mentoring candidates.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.380]   Go ahead.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.360]   Well, so J.D.'s already won the primaries,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.860]   and I expect he will win.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.440]   I mean, it's gonna be,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.300]   I think, a red wave in November,
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.040]   and Ohio is a pretty red state these days.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.000]   Blake's supposed to win the primary in Arizona.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.640]   That's a little bit more of a toss-up,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   but I think he'll do well.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.100]   All right, well, I had a follow-up question,
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.740]   but I'm not allowed to mention the T-word,
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.900]   so let's just get started.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.980]   Why is it such a big deal
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.500]   that, like, Peter supports candidates?
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.860]   You got all these, like, crazy left-wing radicals.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.500]   No, no, I think it's interesting.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.520]   Like, Soros gives unlimited amounts of money
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.600]   to, you know, crazy progressives
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.180]   like Gascon in L.A. and Azzilli and others.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.120]   I mean, why is it such an obsession
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.100]   that we have to focus on who Peter supports?
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.240]   No, no, I just think it's fascinating that he...
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.760]   Peter's articulated his rationale
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.420]   for supporting these candidates
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.260]   and his objective for, you know,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.560]   changing government in a way that he...
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.600]   thinks would benefit the country.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.140]   And Peter's been generally right.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.200]   What is the thesis, Rayburg?
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.340]   I think part of...
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.020]   If you watch his speech from the RNC
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.660]   during the last Trump cycle,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.800]   I think he did a good job kind of articulating
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.940]   that there's a lot of inefficiencies in government
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.240]   and there's a lot of, call it, accumulated fat,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   and we need someone to go in
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.900]   and we need people to go in and really cut this up
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.020]   because so much of politics
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.680]   is driven by what else I'm going to give you,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.120]   not about what I'm going to fix
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.800]   that's already being spent in an inefficient way.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.660]   And as a result, we see debt climb,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.660]   we see taxes climb,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.840]   we see efficiency continue to decline
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.060]   of every dollar invested by the government.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I think that's a really important thesis
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.720]   to see someone actually try and execute against
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.280]   because no one's in the position...
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.980]   Very few people are in the position that he's in
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.440]   to actually be able to, like,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.820]   make that sort of statement.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.420]   Everyone wants something more from their government
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.320]   versus trying to fix the government.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.920]   I think his views are more extreme than that.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.260]   I think his views are more that
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260]   orthodoxy is ruining in America.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.800]   And so you need forms of heterodoxy
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.660]   to basically reset the status quo.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.900]   And I think that's what he believes
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.880]   more than what you just said.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.960]   I think that you need a wholesale reset.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.880]   And in order to have a wholesale reset,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   you need to have these very disruptive candidates
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   that basically start to change the norms.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.980]   I mean, if you think about what Trump did
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.200]   in one election cycle,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.620]   is he's completely sucked an entire cohort of people,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.280]   Hispanics and, you know, moderates,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.700]   and now, you know, a lot of immigrants,
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.640]   towards the end of the day,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.680]   and now, you know, a lot of immigrants,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.240]   towards the right,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.620]   because the Democrats have vacated all of that space
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.500]   in having this massive Trump derangement syndrome
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.320]   and tacking extremely to the left.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.880]   And even if Peter, we'll never know,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.820]   believed in Trump or didn't believe in Trump,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.400]   it didn't matter,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.840]   but the process of him getting that candidate elected
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.140]   over the long arc of history
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.660]   may actually serve to pull America back to the center.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.600]   Pretty good outcome.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.800]   Yeah, and look, the reason why I support J.D.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.720]   and Blake, for that matter,
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.460]   is they are, they represent this more,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.280]   populist, working class wing of the Republican Party,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.520]   and they're dragging the Republican Party
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.800]   in a more working class direction.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.100]   I think that's the future of the party.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.200]   I think that's the opportunity for the party.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.140]   To Chema's point, the Democrats have ceded
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.600]   all the sort of this working class territory
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.700]   by becoming this elite, progressive party.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.980]   And the face of the party right now,
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.220]   the Democratic Party, is Paul Pelosi.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.780]   You know, let's talk about this.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.120]   It's blatant and out in the open.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.720]   He's trading on chip stocks,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.700]   like Nvidia and Intel and so forth,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.600]   like the week before the House
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.100]   is going to vote on a $52 billion subsidy for chip companies.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.180]   No, no, no, be more precise.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.360]   The week before his wife decides
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.500]   when critical legislation goes to the floor of the House
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.100]   to be voted upon.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.640]   So you have the Speaker of the House,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.000]   who's the third most important person in government,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.640]   introducing legislation on her timetable.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.220]   Her husband trades in those specific equities
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.780]   days and maybe even the same day--
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.580]   So gross.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.340]   --and then he's going to be in the White House
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.340]   for the next three years.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.580]   And then he's going to be in the White House
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.580]   for the next three years.

[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.580]   And then on top of that, Jason,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.580]   the mainstream media doesn't say shit.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580]   And then on top of that, Jason,
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.580]   the mainstream media doesn't say shit.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.580]   Now, by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.580]   Now, by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.580]   I think he's a complete goofball.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.580]   I think he's a complete goofball.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.580]   But if Trump had tried to pull this stuff
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.580]   But if Trump had tried to pull this stuff
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.580]   in 2016 or 2017 or 2018,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.580]   in 2016 or 2017 or 2018,
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.580]   in 2016 or 2017 or 2018,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.580]   could you imagine how much media coverage
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.580]   could you imagine how much media coverage
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.580]   there would be?
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.580]   And today, how much of that is covered
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.580]   And today, how much of that is covered
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.580]   by the mainstream media?
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.580]   zero.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.580]   Was it mentioned on MSNBC?
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580]   zero.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580]   Was it mentioned on MSNBC?
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.580]   Nope.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580]   Was it mentioned in any of the press?
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.580]   Was it mentioned in any of the press?
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   Nope.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580]   Let me just set the stage
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.580]   so people don't know what we're talking about.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.580]   So on Tuesday, the Senate advanced
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.580]   So on Tuesday, the Senate advanced
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.980]   a slimmed down version of the original chips bill.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.340]   If you don't know what that is,
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.920]   it's basically a bill that's going to provide
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.380]   $52 billion in subsidies to move
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.920]   chip manufacturing here to the United States,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   something we really need to do.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.160]   It's a bipartisan bill.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.260]   Everybody kind of agrees on this.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.260]   But this is
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260]   been kind of stuck in committee for a little bit.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.540]   It comes a year after the Senate first approved
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.000]   the $250 billion bill to reinforce US chip making
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.820]   to compete with China.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.960]   The reason why this is strategically important
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840]   is because we have a huge chip dependency on Taiwan,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.420]   which is under threat from China.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.120]   So if chips are the new oil,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.040]   you know, Taiwan is the new Middle East
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.800]   or the new Persian Gulf.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.880]   And it is a very dangerous situation
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.300]   for us to be completely dependent on Taiwan.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.560]   Well, not completely, but like for over half our chips.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.500]   So on shoring, advanced chip manufacturing makes sense.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   But I think this is
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.260]   a great example of how you start with a legitimate objective
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.340]   in Washington and very rapidly it turns into corporate welfare
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.960]   and graphed by politicians.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.120]   I mean, yeah, it's gross.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.280]   Yeah, I mean, just because we need to
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.240]   onshore manufacturing doesn't mean that you give Intel
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.940]   and Nvidia giant handouts.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.900]   And then you got Paul Pelosi making millions
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.360]   trading Nvidia options.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.940]   And this is something that is happening.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.540]   What would you have done, Sax,
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.580]   to support on shoring of semiconductor manufacturing?
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.060]   Who would you give the money to?
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.460]   And how would it be kind of dulled down?
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.920]   What would the terms of it be?
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.800]   I don't know that you just give these companies money.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.720]   I mean, I think maybe what you do is you give them tax breaks
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.740]   or various kinds of breaks, but I don't like that.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.460]   They need capital to support that investment
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.460]   because if you look at the kind of ROIC on these companies,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.060]   I haven't looked, but I'm guessing they're in the high teens
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.820]   or something, mid to high teens.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.080]   And they're not gonna be able to invest
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.180]   in some newfangled fab project
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.780]   that may or may not actually have customers
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.620]   at the end of the day.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.420]   Their board would never run out of money.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.740]   They would never approve that on an independent basis.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.580]   They need capital.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.920]   Define ROIC, Freberg.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.200]   Return on invested capital.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.900]   So if you're a big industrial business,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.680]   one of the key metrics that your shareholders look at
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.840]   is the ultimate kind of profits that are generated
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.620]   from a big investment you might make.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.960]   And so you kind of look at that over time,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.640]   you look at the invested money over time
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.660]   and the cash returned over time,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.700]   and you come up with this metric.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.580]   And so it's a key metric
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.500]   for particularly capital intensive businesses.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.180]   And so a business like Intel or Nvidia,
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.380]   I would imagine is gonna have
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.560]   a pretty tough time selling their board
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.220]   on some speculative onshoring fab project.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.340]   There really does need to be capital
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.440]   and acceleration of capital.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.180]   - Freberg, who feeds you this bullshit propaganda?
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.620]   Intel in 2020 approved a share purchase plan
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.880]   where these guys had a hold of $110 billion
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.480]   and have spent all of it except for 7.2 billion.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.680]   They have 6 billion left on the balance sheet.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.360]   - I get it, but they're not gonna put that money at risk.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.340]   Right, like Chamath, imagine you're on the board
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.760]   of Intel and they're like,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.600]   "Hey, we wanna honor-"
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.400]   - So the government, okay, so basically, hold on.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.240]   I make a ton of money.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.080]   - But that's the basis of where this,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.520]   yeah, this is where it all comes from, right?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.080]   - I make a ton of money.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.300]   I have no better ideas of how to do it,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.720]   including theoretically building a chip factory.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.820]   So I'm gonna go to the government for a handout.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.540]   Meanwhile, I'm gonna take all the money that I had,
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.640]   which I could have used to fund this thing,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.400]   and I'm gonna give it away to people
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.060]   who I don't know what they're gonna do with it.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.960]   - I would reframe it.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.260]   I would say that the government wants to see our industry
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.300]   onshore, semi-competitive,
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.740]   semiconductor manufacturing.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.360]   And they are going to the companies,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.420]   not the companies going to the government.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.260]   They're saying,
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.460]   "We want you to onshore semiconductor manufacturing.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.400]   Do that for us now."
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.040]   Like in World War II,
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   we went to the automobile manufacturers and said,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.920]   the government said, "We want you to make airplanes.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.820]   Here's a bunch of money, make airplanes."
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.620]   And that's, so the question then is,
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.040]   who does that money go to?
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.360]   Who else would you give that money to
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.520]   besides the two best chip makers in the world?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.820]   - David's right.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.800]   If you just give us a CapEx subsidy,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.260]   that's a one-time effect that helps you in a moment.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.700]   It doesn't help your business.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.360]   Any reasonable investor who can actually use
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.940]   a simple calculator sees through that nonsense.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.120]   So what David's right is if you had given them
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.380]   sustained tax breaks for being able to build the business line
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.500]   that then supplies things for the duration,
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.340]   you know, tens of years, you're absolutely right.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.700]   Investors would lot it.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.040]   It would make a ton of sense.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   They would be over-earning over a long enough period of time
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.260]   where people would have to bake that
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.080]   into their cashflow estimates,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.220]   where when you discount it,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.380]   if you wanted it back,
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.920]   it would make the enterprise of Intel and Nvidia worth more.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.760]   And then people would then want to own that stock more.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.160]   Giving a CapEx subsidy is a meaningless way
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.260]   in which you basically hand out good money
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.040]   to organizations who have otherwise misallocated
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.740]   the money that they've already had.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.520]   - Yeah, there's a much simpler solution
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.540]   just to Sax's point of like, how do you do this?
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.900]   And giving free money is not the way to do it.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.180]   The best way to do it is to give an incredibly low
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.180]   interest rate loan, like a 30, 40,
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.660]   50 year loan that maybe has some warrants in it,
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.500]   just like a Silicon Valley bank or a Comerica might give
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.780]   in a venture debt loan,
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.180]   where the government actually could make money from this.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.780]   And then you incent them with something
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.140]   that is just too good not to take.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.540]   A 50 year loan of $5 billion to build factories.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.860]   You have to use it for that.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.260]   So it's use it or lose it.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.100]   And then you slowly pay the government back.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.220]   And then maybe we get some warrants in Intel
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.580]   or whoever we give the money to.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.220]   This is something that Obama did with Solyndra,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.140]   which didn't work out,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.420]   but he also did it with Tesla and Tesla paid all that money back early.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.300]   So these loans that the Department of Energy did really did.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.740]   And you got to give Barack Obama a lot of credit for this.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.300]   It really did help drive, even though it wasn't perfect.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.900]   By the way, when did drive a lot of AV adoption,
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.020]   it did really help Tesla become the company it is today.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.980]   Sorry, let me just respond because, you know,
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.300]   I don't know how much we've we've gone through the details of the bill,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.100]   but there are several components to this bill, including,
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.660]   and I just want to highlight if I'm on the board of Intel,
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.340]   I'm not going to make a $10 billion fab investment
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.700]   because, you know, there's there may or may not be,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.580]   you know, profits down the road to justify that size of an investment.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.740]   So if the government comes along and says we will support,
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.540]   we will cover X percent of that investment,
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.300]   I can take on more risk and I'm more willing to make that investment.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.500]   And theoretically, I can afford to pay people a higher wage or a higher salary
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.660]   because I now have more capital freed up to support to do that.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.060]   And so.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.220]   There is an effect that arises by having the government come in,
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.620]   put some money into these projects, accelerate their outcomes,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.340]   and it gives the business more freedom.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.980]   Should it be free, Berg, free money or in the form of a loan?
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.100]   So what should the financial device be?
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.300]   I think is the question that you asked Saks, if I'm interpreting correctly.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.420]   Yeah, I'm not sure that the loan because the loan doesn't resolve the fact
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.180]   that they're having to put up money. Right.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.340]   And so they're not necessarily going to make this onshoring investment.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.060]   The rational capitalist decision is to offshore manufacturing for Intel.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.020]   Yes.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.500]   And it's rational for them from a business perspective,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.980]   from a board perspective, from a fiduciary perspective to onshore manufacturing.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.620]   So the reason they're going to do it is not because they're getting a loan
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.300]   where the interest rate is low.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.780]   That doesn't really solve the problem.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.140]   It's the government saying we're going to put a $10 billion facility.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.260]   We want you to build it and manage it for us.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.180]   And that's effectively what's happening.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.940]   And now by building this $10 billion facility, we've created security
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.660]   for the rest of the U.S. industry.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.540]   It's worth it to the government to put that money up and create security
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.020]   for our economy.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.260]   No, it won't.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.700]   Why wouldn't it create security if we if we have more onshoring of chips?
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.860]   So by the way, there's more security.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.460]   I'll say one more thing.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.100]   There's also an investment tax credit built into this bill, Sachs,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.260]   which does provide over time a bunch of incentives to continue to support
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.220]   and drive the onshoring work that's proposed in the bill.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.860]   If you want the United States.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.860]   Point of personal privilege.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.420]   Can I request that Chamath add just one button to his shirt?
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.020]   But it's just.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.620]   Is it too distracting for you?
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.820]   You can't say you're on the glare.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.940]   You can't voir dire your onshoring.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.140]   Oh, geez.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.300]   First, I had to watch Jason do the gun show.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.020]   Now I got to watch Chamath.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.980]   Show us your guns.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.380]   Come on, pull up that sleeve and show us what you.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.380]   Let's move on.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.260]   Let's move on.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.940]   I want to say one more thing about the Pelosi stuff.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.340]   So here's the data.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.500]   I don't know if you guys have looked at the full history of the Pelosi trading data.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.180]   Here's the link.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.620]   She's all the trading that's happened over the last couple of years.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:13.740]   So and over the past year, he has bought Nvidia four different times
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.780]   each time in the same kind of volume range.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.900]   So the timing certainly made
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.740]   a peer suspect and it's certainly a terrible kind of thing to see.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.140]   He's also bought Apple in the last month.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.260]   Microsoft.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.100]   Sorry, he sold Apple.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.220]   He bought Microsoft.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.340]   He bought Alliance Bernstein earlier in the year.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.780]   He's made a few trades this year.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.980]   But Nvidia, he's actually bought on four different occasions over the past 12 months
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.100]   for whatever that's worth. Right.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.060]   I'm not trying to defend it, but I think we should be intellectually honest
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.500]   about the fact that this guy, you know, does take points of view in certain companies.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.940]   He trades in a handful of companies.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.860]   Are we only to be intellectually honest enough to think that a husband
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.700]   talks to his wife and vice versa?
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.180]   Or does that not happen anymore?
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.220]   Depends on the husband and wife.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.940]   But yeah, I think this is blatant and out in the open.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.740]   I mean, it looks really at a minimum.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.340]   The appearance is of graft and corruption.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.780]   The appearance of impropriety is impropriety.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.380]   They shouldn't be allowed to trade.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.860]   They should have to put their stuff into blind trusts or they should maybe trade
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.220]   once a year and they should have to announce their trades before the trades happen.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.420]   Hey, here's what I'm planning on doing.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.620]   Just like a CEO is planning on doing this stuff.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.820]   It's ridiculous.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.060]   It's ridiculous that they can do this.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.140]   And why doesn't the mainstream media cover this?
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.140]   They have.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.900]   And Jason, do you think that if Trump, if this had happened during Trump,
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.060]   it would have a lot more coverage than this Pelosi incident?
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.860]   I do remember a lot of coverage on Trump.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.980]   It really doesn't get covered.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.580]   I mean, if you just search for it today, you'll see basically the only media outlets covering
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.260]   it are like Fox News and then Zero Hedge.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.700]   You know, that's it.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.740]   I mean, that's how I found out about it is like the Zero Hedge tweets about it.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740]   Me too.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.780]   So Daily Beast, you know, headline.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.300]   You can go digging.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.820]   Seven hours ago, Dems quietly tried to jam Pelosi on stock trading ban.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:57.900]   But if you're asking me, you asked me a question, Chamath, is the media largely biased against
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.380]   Trump and gives a free pass to the Dems?
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   Yes, I would say that that is the trend.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.860]   Yes.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.100]   I think that is intellectually honest of you.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.940]   Well, no, I mean, I think the media is bankrupt.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.820]   They're just going for clicks.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.820]   And I think, you know, we've talked about this before.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.180]   They saw Trump as an existential risk and they just did whatever it took to get him out of
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   office, even putting up Biden as the candidate.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.860]   But in doing so, they completely burned all of their credibility.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.980]   They lost a lot of credibility.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:27.060]   And now the Dems are starting to become increasingly detached and out of touch and maybe hated.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.940]   But then the result is that the mainstream media is just no longer trusted.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.780]   The media and the Democratic Party both have the same problem, which is they suffer from
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:40.220]   what the Democratic political scientist Roy Toucheira has called professional class hegemony.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:46.500]   I mean, they are populated by college graduates with degrees who basically have this very
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.820]   elitist progressive agenda.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:54.220]   And that is what is causing the Democratic, the working class to defect from the Democratic Party,
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.460]   their historical base in droves.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.260]   Look at Hispanics.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:03.340]   Well, first of all, if you go to the latest Biden polling numbers, he's down to 31% approval,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.860]   60% disapprove.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.780]   Okay, so the trend is getting worse there.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.740]   But you look at Hispanics, it's down to 19% approval, 70% disapproval.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.940]   It's an even more intense version of the same problem.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.460]   You had Myra Ford.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.980]   Flores get elected in that Texas seat, this is a district that went, it's basically a predominantly
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:29.220]   Mexican-American district. They went for Biden by 18 points just, you know, two years ago. And now
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.720]   they're voting for her by over 10 points. So you're Republicans winning that seat for the first time.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.400]   So you have these huge defections. Now, why is that happening? Because the Democrats are
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:46.720]   appealing to the donor class on issues like border, on issues like crime, and on issues like
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.800]   CRT in schools. I mean, you know, the working class people in this country, they don't want
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.620]   open borders. They want crime to be prosecuted and cracked down on. And they do not want an
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.860]   ideological education for their kids. Okay. It's very simple. But that basically is why the
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.820]   Democratic Party is losing votes. Now, let me give you a couple other examples of the Democrats
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.380]   cynically appealing to the donor class.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:18.240]   So recently, there's an article about the Democrats have spent $44 million this election
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:25.580]   cycle, basically running ads in favor of the crazy MAGA candidate in primaries. There's been a bunch
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.140]   of reports of this where in competitive Republican primaries, the Democrats will actually spend money
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:37.240]   on behalf of the sort of the more perceived crazy Republican, the MAGA candidate, the election
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.120]   denier, and so forth.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:43.700]   Because of the perception, they'll be easier to beat in the general. But I think this is a case
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.020]   to be careful what you wish for. Because, you know, if we have a red wave in November, you're
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.660]   going to end up with more of these candidates basically winning. So it's a very cynical
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.180]   strategy. The other example, I think, of a very cynical strategy is you saw there was a vote in the
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:06.580]   House this past week on gay marriage. And the House voted to repeal DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act,
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:13.000]   and support, basically codify Obergefell, right, the Supreme Court's decision on gay marriage.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.320]   Something like, you know, 60 Republicans voted for it. Look, I would have liked to have seen more
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.280]   Republicans vote for this. I think it should be like, you know, majority of the Republican
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   party should be voting for this. But the point is that is there any intention of the Democrats
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.080]   to bring this up in the Senate and pass it and codify Obergefell when they have a chance?
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.000]   I think the answer is no. Why? Because the Democrats would rather fundraise off this issue.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.300]   The same thing was true,
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.620]   about Roe. The Democrats had super majorities in the Senate. Under Obama, they could have codified
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.260]   Roe. They never took the chance. Why? Because they would rather fundraise off this issue
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:53.000]   from progressive elites, the donor class in California and New York. So this is why they're
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.440]   not going to codify Obergefell. You don't even think that's the case?
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:00.200]   Absolutely. Obama said it on the record. Obama was asked, why will you not? He campaigned
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.780]   on codifying Roe v. Wade. And then very quickly into it, he was asked when he had the super
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.280]   majority in favor of Roe v. Wade, why would you not? And he said, why would you not? And he said,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.160]   built the house in the senate will you act on roe v wade he goes no it is not a priority anymore
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.560]   that's a quote it absolutely could have been codified just like a birch fell could be codified
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.140]   tomorrow look there are there are 10 republican votes there are 10 republican votes at least
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.280]   for this in the senate you have a filibuster proof super majority in the senate who would
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:32.500]   support this the same republicans who supported the gun restriction bill that biden just signed
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.340]   and that supported the infrastructure bill you think they could codify abortion rights in this
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.220]   country right now if they wanted no no no that that moment has passed that moment's passed i'm
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.880]   not saying republicans would never give women the right no no look there's not a super majority in
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.860]   the senate anymore for uh for a codifying road there is a super majority right now for codifying
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.700]   a birch fell they could do that right now and they're not chamath you've been a donor to the
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:00.080]   democratic party do you believe that yeah do you do you believe that the um the abortion issue
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.480]   drove you and others to put more money in
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.040]   and that maybe not no because because the leadership of the democratic party
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:13.360]   focused on uh trump in the last big cycle it was all trump trump trump trump trump
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:21.280]   do i think that more grassroots fundraising focuses on that or gun rights or what do you think
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.360]   what's next is saying is true that they actually held off on trying to codify roe so that they
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.920]   could continue to support again i'm just i'm just going to give you the quote because it there's
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.460]   there's no opinion needed okay
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.960]   so i'm going to give you the quote because it there's no opinion needed okay
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.320]   april 29th of 2009 president barack obama says on wednesday he favored abortion rights for women
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.880]   but that passing a law guaranteeing these rights were not his top priority i believe that women
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.840]   should have the right to choose obama told a new conference marking his first hundred days in office
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.560]   again when he had super majorities in both the house of the senate but i think that the most
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.280]   important thing we can do to tamp down some of the anger surrounding this issue is to focus on those
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.440]   areas we can't agree on so you make a promise you get into the seat of power and you're going to be
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.900]   in power you have the decision on what your legislative agenda should be and he made that
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.460]   calculation and david is right sadly that it was in a moment where we had a clear line of sight
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.260]   to codifying many of these rights yeah but the question that's not the question that freeberg
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.980]   is asking he's saying do you think that they specifically did this to keep it as an open issue
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.660]   to raise money off it i don't think that's believable oh yeah absolutely no way no way
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.420]   absolutely if you want to talk about cynicism sack
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:39.080]   the truly cynical move was you know trump saying i am going to get this in evangelical vote to win
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.480]   the primaries to get those 20 percent who want to take away the right for women to have an abortion
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.200]   and i'm going to stack the supreme court to actually achieve that that's the most cynical
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.320]   of all of the political stuff okay let's just let's define terms political and so hold on a
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.440]   second hold on a second let's define terms so you may be opposed to what trump did but there
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.400]   wasn't that wasn't cynical he stated what he was going to do when he ran for office
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.160]   and then he did it he lived up to his promise somebody who he did not believe in that he did
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.920]   not believe in that he did it specifically to get those votes we all know he didn't believe in it
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.180]   we all know he believes in a women's right to choose jason he he created a platform to get
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.220]   elected yes that's what i'm saying when he was elected he executed on that platform i think what
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:27.240]   david sacks is saying is obama had a platform to get him elected and when obama chose had the choice
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.380]   he chose to not execute on the platform and that is also true and all i'm just saying is we
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.860]   owe it to ourselves to be intellectually honest about what happened that is what happened okay
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.840]   both of these two guys made claims hold on one second both of these two guys made claims acting
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.960]   in your own self-interest i understand but please i want this on the record both of these two guys
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.900]   made claims to become president it turns out that trump actually did execute on most of his claims
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.360]   as abhorrent as they were to some yeah and obama on some of the most important issues of our time
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   did not look what trump did was just simple coalition politics he thought it was important
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.160]   to win the religious right he basically appealed to them he said that if you vote for me i will
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.520]   nominate these judges he delivered he delivered he didn't believe in it himself right so that's what
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.040]   i'm talking about at a certain point doesn't matter that's not something i believe people
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.560]   should have for sure principles okay look so i know it doesn't matter to you that he doesn't
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.840]   have principles but it matters to me that people are pretty good but jason what does it mean to
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.240]   have the principle of saying that he's going to he's going to pass and codify roe v wade and not
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.340]   do it what is that then i think he uh well listen i i the quote you gave doesn't give
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.520]   why he didn't do it he didn't make it a priority it could also hold on let me finish it could also
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.800]   be that he believed that it would not get overturned so he should spend his time on
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.120]   obamacare and other things i'm saying cynicism is when you believe one thing and then you do
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   something to act in your own self-interest and that's what i think that's what i think
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.040]   did hold on a second we don't need to go back all the way to the obama administration because
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.320]   the issue i'm talking about today is that in the past week they had a vote codifying
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   aubergine fell on gay marriage and uh repealing the bill and they're not going to vote for him
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.880]   you're saying DOMA okay so now listen I actually think there were so many Republican votes in the
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.680]   house even though I would have liked to seen more there were enough that this might shame Schumer
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   into bringing up the vote because it's going to be so obvious if he doesn't that he is doing this
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.420]   for a reason right because they have the votes they can pass this just like they passed the gun
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:28.000]   bill a few weeks ago right just like they passed um the infrastructure bill so if he if Schumer
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.680]   doesn't bring this up it's a very cynical move you think it's strategically to have that as an
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.200]   issue to phrase funding I I I get it and it's really proof listen do you think both sides are
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   cynical of course both sides engage in politics however however what I'm talking about is the type
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.500]   of cynicism so I think that there's a lot of issues on which the Democrats would rather appeal
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.540]   to the donor class basically that lives on the coast New York California and be able to keep
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.940]   fundraising on that issue and basically scaremonger on that issue and basically scare a little bit on
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:03.400]   that issue instead of just winning the issue they can just win this issue right now do you have
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:09.820]   less interest in supporting the Democratic Party based on the principle you stated that in the past
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:15.160]   there have been kind of promises and capital raised against you know codifying row and then
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:21.640]   it not happening they never made those promises to me so I never felt like they lied to me um I want
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.800]   to be very clear so then nobody and I never asked for that to be a precondition of my donation again
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.880]   my
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.440]   capital was focused on one thing which is I thought that President Trump was not the right
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.360]   person to lead this country and I thought very clearly that the bright Democrat could do a much
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:44.920]   much better job and I am glad that Biden won and I'm glad that the money that I put in maybe in no
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.320]   in any small way but hopefully in some reasonable non-trivial way helped and I'm glad that that
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.720]   money helped even out the Senate I'm glad all of those things happened and so I want to be clear
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.820]   they've never made those kinds of promises to be
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:03.040]   nor have I ever asked I make a high level decision on who I think the best candidate should be and
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.180]   support the party that will get that best candidate affected what I was just trying to make clear to
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:14.680]   you guys is that sometimes even a Democrat it's important for us to be intellectually honest about
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   what has happened it's very easy to look at the other guy and find all the ways in which they
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:27.040]   screwed up or tried to screw you or you know is in a lack sympathy or lack sympathy all of these things
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.200]   it's much harder oftentimes to look at your own team and say wait a minute why didn't x y and z
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.880]   happen and the reason I'm bringing up what happened in 2009 is I think David is right
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.980]   we have a moment in time where the leadership of the Democratic Party
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.700]   can codify rights that should be codified and they should have in hindsight they should have
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.200]   done it I know just to be clear no it is still open we can do it I'm talking about Roe v Wade
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.700]   and yes and for the for the issue we're talking about now it should be codified absolutely and just to be
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.020]   clear I'm an independent I would vote for a Republican who was socially progressive and
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.860]   fiscally conservative as long as they're for gay marriage as long as they're pro women's right to
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.000]   choose uh and they were fiscally conservative I would vote for a Republican I'm a moderate
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.320]   independent I want to see less government and more efficient government and I want people I
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.500]   want the government out of people's personal lives and I think that's where Sax and I are
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.760]   exactly the same we both want I mean Sax do you want the government involved in people's personal
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.640]   lives you're a classic Republican by the way according to the Monmouth poll from a few weeks ago you
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   represent four percent of the voting base I do that's an extreme yeah that's an extreme minority
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:41.200]   the the the lowest self-identifying quadrant of fiscal conservative versus kind of fiscal
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.660]   liberal social conservative social liberal is the fiscal conservative social liberal what are we all
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.340]   here we're I think we all fit this profile fiscally we want the government to be run
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:57.580]   conservatively you know and with less government and we want progressive social change right I mean I
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.420]   feel that way don't put me in a corner government out of people's personal I don't know I'm just
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.560]   asking I'm asking you guys if we're all insane I wouldn't define my cultural positions as progressive
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.880]   social change because the change that progressives are trying to do right now is radical what I favor
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.220]   is social tolerance I think we need to be tolerant I think we need to be a tolerant society America is
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.980]   a very broad diverse country we need to find ways to live together and find accommodation on issues
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.560]   that are very contentious so that includes tolerance for gay marriage so look I'm on board with that but
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:34.060]   the radical progressive agenda of social change which includes upending the uh the criminal justice
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.620]   system in favor of I know not prosecution over that yeah what's happening in the schools with
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.140]   CRT and the sort of hyper ideologized education look they should just be teaching the basics
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.520]   reading yeah leave it up to parents to do the other stuff yeah exactly I agree and so on down
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.000]   the line but maybe progressive is the wrong term because that that now has been co-opted
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.860]   less government involved in your personal life and tolerance I think we all agree on that and I think
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.540]   it's a great word everybody agrees with tolerance it's a privileged position to want to have less
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:07.120]   government involved in your life right I mean many people in the United States have been able to
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.980]   thrive and and survive because of the role that government has played in their lives and there's
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.280]   obviously on one end of the spectrum extreme grift
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.400]   and on the other end of the spectrum extreme need that is being met uh by the wealthiest
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:27.040]   government in the world and it is a that you know it is in that middle where all of them where do you
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:33.700]   think is fighting how would you describe your politics in these two dynamics right are you also
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:44.500]   in this four percent freeberry yeah yeah yeah no I'm here um I'm trying to be thoughtful about
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:51.100]   this because yeah no I think it's the idea yeah I think that the government's role is to support
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.980]   those in need not those in want and I think that the government should be held accountable for
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:03.640]   that role and I think that those of us who can that are sitting in privileged positions and seats
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.900]   should enable the government to perform that role well and we should be positive
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:15.880]   actors meaning we should support we should pay taxes and we should help people and um and
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:21.580]   institutions in need and that are you know kind of for the greater good and then we should be holding
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.280]   ourselves our government and our our politicians to account for inefficiencies and the biggest concern
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.620]   I have is less about are the people in need needs being met as much as are we holding our government
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.540]   to account for the performance of its services and duties to the American people and I really
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:43.300]   like this want I like this want need concept here can you give an example of where the government
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.960]   like people need something but then there's another group that wants something and maybe
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.880]   we're over stretching and and you know giving into wants when we should be focused on needs
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.220]   and efficiency yeah I'll give you a pretty um an example I know reasonably well which
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.680]   is the farm bill passes every four years and the farm bill in order to get it passed in both the
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:10.360]   house and the Senate it has components that serve both farmers and support the the food stamp program
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.640]   uh so the food stamp program obviously supports millions of Americans that are in need of food
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.960]   can't afford food they get EBD cards they get support in buying food and there's a lot of
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.580]   programs and access that are enabled by that program but in order but that mostly services
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.160]   the needs of urban areas of cities so it
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.480]   passes that that element of the bill is attractive and appealing to the representatives of cities
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.040]   found in the house on the other side in order to get it passed in the Senate where the majority
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:42.340]   of senators come from rural states which are have significant farming populations the farming
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:47.500]   subsidies are planted in that same bill and as a result because everyone's getting something
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.200]   that bill as a whole has now grown to a multi-hundred billion dollar bill that gets
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.100]   passed every few years because in order for the Senate to pass it the house says okay we'll give
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.960]   you all these farm subsidies in order for the house to pass it the Senate says well sorry and
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.220]   vice versa right we'll give you all these food stamps but but both of them now have incredible
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.620]   what do they call it pork or fat or whatever yeah the amount of money that's wasted that isn't
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.720]   actually servicing the original intention and need of either of the parties that are represented by
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.400]   that bill is extraordinary and I've spent a lot of time in the farmville I actually went with
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.040]   lobbyists years ago to DC and I actually met with the Senate and House ad committees I've gone very
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.640]   deep into the bill and some of the programs in that bill and it's just shocking to me in the
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.240]   same way that Palmer Lucky shared in our all-in Summit how shocking it is how defense spending
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.820]   works in this country it's shocking to me how some of the the programs work in the farm bill
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:44.380]   uh how much money and how much waste there is and how much Griff there is and so yes we are meeting
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.120]   the needs of populations in need in this country but so much more of the bill now is about people
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   wanting more in order to pass the bill and it's and it's bloated all right so he's gonna come in
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.980]   and fix it because where's the incentive for anyone to come in and cut that bill up where's the
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.520]   incentive to fix it if both sides are barbelling the grift then there's no incentive they're they're
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   they're in a dance to to maximize the grift so where do you stand now if we were to sort
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:12.100]   of look at politics without the Biden and trump derangement syndrome without the the tribalism
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.840]   just in terms of first principles I think what we're seeing here is we all want to see radical
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.760]   competence in the government social issues fight you know and fiscally how we run the
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.400]   country where do you stand how would you describe yourself now
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.560]   look I mean I think of things in terms of risk
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:39.040]   here's what I see um I see that there are a handful of issues that remain
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.740]   in terms of social policy that just need to get codified
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:52.960]   gay marriage is an example of one abortion rights is an example of the other then
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.660]   and and I think like those are like really
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:05.320]   to my perspective speak about human individual Liberty which I think should trump everything so
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.800]   everybody should be allowed to kind of pursue the best version of themselves however that manifests
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:18.640]   in the person you marry to in in the gender you Express not these are like things where what you
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:25.000]   do to be happy you should be allowed to do period end of story then there are issues where I think
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.800]   are much thornier and
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.520]   as I get older I become increasingly ambivalent uh or confused actually is a better word and
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.780]   gun control is a perfect example of that where I don't know what my right is to go and adjudicate
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.860]   a change to the Constitution that's been there since the founding of this country
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:50.620]   that's a much more complicated issue and so I think we have to basically devolve that right
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:56.740]   to the states where individual states will have very different laws and part of how you choose
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:02.680]   to express where you live will be defined by some of those rules so that's the social side extreme
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:10.600]   tolerance is really how I would sum it up economically so but but I think the risk to America
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:18.520]   imploding quote unquote because of an issue in that surface area in my opinion is extremely limited
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:25.960]   if I look on the economic lens however I think there are enormous risks to American leadership
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.680]   and exceptionalism
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:36.100]   and we need a wholesale reset of how we create incentives of how government should work of how
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.820]   regulatory capture should work of how the capital markets work these rules are way too perverted
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:52.600]   and it's creating enormous stress in a system and again I go back to the example I used last episode
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.320]   the thing that if you look for example like
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:02.500]   you know in that example of Sri Lanka Singapore Jamaica and how there were these three completely
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:09.580]   different outcomes underneath the most successful outcome was an incredibly clear transparent and
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:16.960]   simple financial framework you cannot spend more than you have you need to invest in long-term
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.920]   programs like education and health care you need to make them broadly available
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.960]   and then you need to have an absolute free market that gets the best ideas to the top of the funnel
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:32.500]   and if you can just incorporate those things the tax law could be four pages you know
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:40.540]   the the number of regulations could be 50 pages you know the simple rule that says to the Federal
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:47.740]   Reserve you can't just print free money ad hoc so I'm I'm much more concerned about the fiscal
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:55.420]   future of America I I think that there's so much movement and progress on the social side including
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:01.180]   the freedom of movement of people to different states it is an important set of issues but in
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.540]   terms of what drives the outcome and future success for our kids and our kids as kids
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.440]   people should not sleep on the economy because if we get this wrong
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.880]   that will be the tinderbox that lights everything on fire
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:19.960]   sacks when you hear you know everybody sort of explain their basic uh belief system how far apart
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.220]   do you think we all are on this podcast because I think that's been a an issue we see a lot of the
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.540]   comments discussing you and I discussing it feels like on most of these issues and I think that's
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.020]   people ask me how I'm friends with you all the time and I'm sure you get that question as well
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:38.860]   yeah and I love you thinking about it no I I love sex like a brother and anytime we talk about basic
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:43.660]   issues we're very much in sync and then when we talk about politics it feels like we're super you
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:49.660]   know uh you know opposed you know in in opposition to each other when you hear that we all have
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.020]   essentially the same stack of uh fundamental beliefs
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:59.440]   how do you interpret this in terms of politics and in America writ large and and how do we get
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.420]   consensus in this country to be more effective in running the country for the citizens I think
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.960]   the media drives a lot of polarization right because they're feeding us a bunch of bogus
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:13.840]   narratives you look at the polling around the trust in the traditional media has absolutely
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.000]   plummeted through the floor I mean they basically have instead of just reporting objectively the
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.720]   facts they I think the audience has recognized that they are activists they are basically
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.100]   pushing an agenda and they're pushing a bunch of bogus narratives and I think it does drive the
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:33.700]   polarization so that's part of it to go back to you know what what are the core issues that motivate
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:39.460]   me and like who I support look I think we could probably agree on a lot of stuff I want us to
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.680]   pursue more of an internationally cautious you know agenda less interventionist because it
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.220]   really hasn't worked out for us very well over the last 20 years with all these Wars that failed
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.540]   I want us to be fiscally responsible and promote a healthy economy
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:58.960]   to what Jamal said and then third I'd like us to be socially tolerant now why does that leave me in
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   this current environment to support Republicans well on international on sort of foreign policy
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.320]   neither party is really very good both parties are sort of pushing some version of Bush Doctrine
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.040]   light where we're basically over involving ourselves in all these countries all over the
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.380]   world but the Republicans at least have a faction that's in favor of realism and restraint so I'm
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:26.560]   trying to help kind of push that direction within the party the Democrats just are still very much
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:33.280]   in this liberal interventionist mode on fiscal issues both parties are guilty of overspending
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.600]   and creating this ruinous federal debt and deficits that we have however
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.640]   there's no way to avoid the fact that the Democrats are just worse I mean Biden wanted
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:49.180]   an extra four trillion of spending on this whole build back better on top of the four trillion yet
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.860]   so listen I know the Republicans don't have clean hands on this issue but the progressives are just
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.120]   worse and as long as the progressives are calling the shots the Democratic Party they're just worse
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.040]   on spending and then you got social tolerance listen on the issues on these sort of key rights
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.200]   issues that have been the kind of the old social issues the last 50 years by and large not on all
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.840]   these things by and large I'm with you guys that I'm in favor of sort of the the socially tolerant
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.460]   position but look at who is pushing social intolerance today I mean the progressives are
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:18.820]   the most
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.600]   intolerant group in America they're the ones pushing cancel culture they're the ones trying
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.100]   to shove their positions down the throats of ordinary Americans this is what's creating the
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.980]   backlash you look at issues today like CRT like the progress their approach on crime on borders
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:38.560]   the progressives are trying to promote I think a social policy that is fundamentally intolerant
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:44.140]   and and doesn't accord any respect or room for traditional Americans to live their lives the
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:48.640]   way they want to and you have to be tolerant of them as well we're not going to have peace in our
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:48.760]   society
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Yeah
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Yeah
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Yeah
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.860]   without some tolerance of traditionalists okay let's wrap on this and then move to China I I
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.720]   sent you guys a um this was a quote by Mike Solana a tweet from Mike Solana
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.820]   the caption is I've been wondering how they were going to spin this and this builds exactly on David
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:12.020]   just said here when the Quinnipiac Quinnipiac poll came out and about approved disapprove
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:18.500]   about President Biden you know the big outlier was the Hispanic population
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.740]   the Hispanic population nice to see you guys thank you so much for being here and I appreciate it
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:18.800]   thank you so much for being here and I appreciate it
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.540]   thank you so much for being here and I appreciate it 19% approved 70% disapprove and the the article in
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   19% approved 70% disapprove and the the article in
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.580]   19% approved 70% disapprove and the the article in the Washington Post which tries to kind of
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:33.560]   sort of like clean this all up and whitewash it says fake news speaks many languages but it's
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:40.700]   particularly fond of Spanish essentially saying that you know the the fake news problem in in the
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.280]   Spanish language has basically gotten so bad that you know this sort of explains why Hispanics have
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:52.820]   have moved in droves and it's like a whole race baiting cheap shot article but the point of all
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:58.400]   of this is just to show that uh the left this is what really does kind of bum me out they are they
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.000]   are probably more intolerant than they've ever been they are there's an intellectual dishonesty
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.460]   like if Rachel matter really wanted to increase her standing and position she would just start the
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.260]   next program with Nancy Pelosi's trades and say listen we all know let's call this what it is it's
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:20.060]   not cool and here's how it should change she'll never do it I know and I think that's the
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.080]   disappointing part about all this okay so let's shift now I think we well just just what can I say
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:29.060]   one final thing about this whole thing that we can move on is I think I think if you are sort of
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.320]   purple and centrist I think the first two years of the bind administration were really a missed
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.860]   opportunity because I think there's sort of this conventional wisdom that the parties are so
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.720]   polarized they can't get anything done I think we saw actually there's enough Republican votes or
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.240]   there were in the in the previous Congress this this current Congress they got the
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.580]   infrastructure bill done they got um the gun bill done you know with the red flag laws and so forth
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:57.900]   that we talked about they can get codification of gay marriage done if they want to they could have
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.940]   gotten uh the electoral count Act reform so if Biden hadn't gone all the way with his progressive
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.740]   voting rights agenda and just focused on reforming the electoral count Act then you could have
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.920]   invented a situation like we had on January 6 that that what was happening inside the capital not
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.020]   outside so there was a lot of stuff they could have passed and they didn't why because the in
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.460]   the in the first half of his administration Biden's been completely captive to the progressives there's
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:29.100]   another thing as well you could get a child tax credit uh passed you could get Romney would
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.900]   basically be the floor leader on that in the Senate they could pass a child tax credit that's
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.720]   the most popular part of BBB why don't they peel that off and vote on it
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.960]   you know because they went through the whole thing that's right the progressives are holding
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.920]   it hostage saying that we're not going to give that to you unless you do the whole enchilada and
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.600]   of course there's no votes for that so I think there's and and so who ultimately is the culprit
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.160]   for allowing this to happen will partly bind but also Ron Clay and the chief of staff I mean they've
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.260]   made a instead of triangulating to the center they should have realized hey we're a 50 50
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:04.420]   president right I mean we have a 50 50 Senate we should be triangulating we should be building a
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.700]   centrist coalition Ron claims that has been letting going modern
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.260]   progress has tried the train Biden had a clear path to go right to the center pull everybody in
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:17.360]   pull the working class in that's been his supporting base who he is working class and
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.860]   so he is and and he blew it by going too far to the left if he wants to save this presidency he
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:27.740]   should go straight to the middle and get all the working class behind him by the guy that went to
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:35.240]   some elite you know uh East Coast liberal art school where he got a master's in you know fine
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.680]   arts and his four hundred thousand in debt that's not Joe Biden
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:45.840]   but he's let all these people run over the White House and it's too late now because I think what's
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.820]   going to happen is well the Republicans are going to win the house how much time did we spend talking
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:57.660]   about canceling student debt for who yeah no for a bunch of elite uh people with graduate degrees
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.700]   from yeah it's a leak I mean listen there's grifters on both sides it's disgusting and we
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.380]   need to get to a version of politics that maybe is more like our conversations here but let's let's
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:13.540]   get to another society that we thought was going to roll over ours but um and that we were in we
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:19.960]   were behind on in terms of competition China's in chaos right now apparently um in terms of slowing
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:25.120]   economic growth bank protests mortgage protests exactly what I predicted last year when you guys
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.200]   were talking about China was going to dunk on us and I said you know it's very hard to run these
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.840]   authoritarian countries and the citizens like to protest when they get the short end of the
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.640]   uh the stick and here we go Chinese economy is is growing
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.020]   very slowly they were going to do five and a half percent this year they were only 0.4 in Q2
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:48.440]   covet has a lot to do with this but there's been a series of bank protests and uh the media has been
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:53.120]   trying to figure out exactly what's going on here to just set the stage here rural banks in China
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.600]   in a couple of provinces froze a bunch of people's uh withdrawals in April okay sounds like the crypto
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:06.260]   uh contagion in many ways they had been offering unusually high interest rates also sounding like
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.100]   what's going on here no no I think it's I think it's more like 2008 Jason I think the financial I
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.000]   think it's more like the financial crisis in 2008 that was driven by the real estate bubble yes
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.900]   they've got their own real estate bubble which is collapsing there correct and so there's there's
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:24.480]   multiple things going on at once the authorities haven't said how much money is frozen uh protesters
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:30.120]   claim it's billions of uh Juan but it's hundreds of millions in the U.S after weeks without a
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:36.480]   resolution customers have been began protesting plain clothes thugs have been hitting and kicking
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.560]   protesters and as of Wednesday a video went viral of the CCP bringing in tanks to protect the banks
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:49.860]   very uh evocative of Tiananmen Square I have a question so go ahead yeah so China has a very
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:58.740]   explicit zero tolerance policy on covet why do you guys think they are so extreme in that policy like
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:06.460]   any any ideas like have they explained why it has to be zero tolerance they have not explained
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:11.440]   that um and if you believe that they're the origin of covet maybe they have some insider information
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.960]   about long-haul covet and that was something I want to talk to Friedberg about if he thinks this
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.840]   you know long-term covet stuff is a really acute issue but freebird what do you think yeah I don't
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:30.100]   let me I don't want to answer that can I answer that if you don't want to yeah listen I I think
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:34.240]   the answer is very simple but I do want to talk about the Chinese economy I I I oh yeah yeah yeah
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:40.540]   yeah this is a complex issue there's a lot more going on there so on on zero covet I think this
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:46.780]   is coming directly from Xi this is his policy and I think that earlier in the pandemic they were
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:53.860]   hailing their response which they saw as orderly and effective at controlling covet and they were
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:51:00.820]   contrasting that with a chaotic Western response and so I think that the credibility of the CCP
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.940]   and G himself got tied up in this idea
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:10.000]   of stopping covet entirely of zero covet and so I think this is coming directly from the top and
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   it's having a huge impact on their economy and I think this is one of the dangerous aspects of a
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.280]   autocratic system is you got one guy at the top making the decisions and if he's wrong there's
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.420]   not really a great feedback and nobody can question him yeah there's no questioning the
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:30.640]   God King yeah you know it sort of recalls um a situation in China I think it's about 500
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.760]   years ago there was a Chinese emperor who banned shipbuilding
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:39.880]   and banning having a Navy and because of that China shut itself off from Global Trade and it
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:45.160]   fell well behind the West which then explored and captured the new world there's this question about
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:50.500]   you know the Chinese uh Chinese culture and civilization was much more advanced than the
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:56.560]   West than Europe a thousand years ago but basically it fell behind and a big reason is because this
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.700]   unilateral decision by one emperor to basically close themselves off from the rest of the world
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   so you have to wonder does this um autocratic
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:09.100]   move by G basically doomed their economy to a recession it seems like they're not learning from
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.600]   our experience these lockdowns didn't work I mean you can't stop the virus it's eventually going to
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:19.900]   get out even I saw Biden got the virus this week I mean it's out right it's endemic now everybody's
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.380]   going to get it is basically what's happening making a bunch of heavy-handed decisions like
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:28.660]   this so you have besides lockdowns it was it's also the crackdowns it's the crackdown on the
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.680]   tech industry yeah the venture funding has plummeted uh and so
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:39.500]   people has so LPs are no longer investing in funds there with the exception of Sequoias which seems to
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:45.020]   be struggling but is still able to raise some money and then additionally uh founders can't
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.860]   raise money and founders are questioning when they meet with VCs if they can actually if the
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.720]   VCs are just meeting with them theatrically uh the story that came out this week in the FT if
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.220]   they're just meeting with them theatrically because they want to still hold out hope that
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.600]   they'll be a venture capital industry but there may not be a VC industry in China anymore let me
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.380]   just give you the
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:08.060]   housing stuff and then Freeburg I know you want to chime in on this so there's also mortgage boy
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:13.940]   boycotts happening at the same time as this fugazi bank stuff happened the bank stuff seems to be not
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.840]   the national banks these are local banks that apparently could have been running some kind of
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.860]   uh grift where people deposited the money it looks a lot like the savings and loan
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:27.380]   kind of uh behavior in the 90s in in the US and these are regional banks to be clear this isn't
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.240]   the national banks and so at the same time the mortgage boycotts are happening in three at 301
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.200]   unfinished developments
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.040]   in 91 cities homeowners are accusing developers are failing to deliver the apartments they've
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.180]   already paid for according to Bloomberg 70 of household wealth in China's tied up in property
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.440]   much higher than the US this is downstream of the whole Evergrande thing right you got Evergrande
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.180]   Evergrande basically defaulted and there were a whole bunch of people who prepaid for their homes
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.080]   and so they're already paying mortgage but Evergrande never finished the homes and now
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.200]   they're rising up because they're saying why should we pay for a home that was never delivered
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.720]   right I just want to like take a zoom out because I think it's worth you know we can focus on any one
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:08.240]   of these particular things that are happening and try and diagnose them and dissect them but if you
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.040]   zoom out a little bit I think it paints a more interesting picture over the last 30 years right
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:21.020]   the Chinese economy grew from 318 billion to in 1990 to 10 and a half trillion in uh 2020 right
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:30.980]   incredible growth GDP per capita you know grew uh kind of in a similar ratio right now from 318
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.600]   bucks per person to 12
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:37.700]   500 in 30 years I mean really unprecedented in the history of humanity China now accounts for 20
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:42.980]   percent of global GDP from less than two percent 1990. now if you look at historically what drove
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.760]   that growth we all talk about manufacturing right manufacturing counts for about a third of the
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:55.220]   economy and manufacturing as a sector was growing in China 25 year over year in 2008 and then only
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:55:00.800]   grew six percent in 2022. it's like basically you know kind of reaching an all-time low in recent
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.540]   years so that's historically been the
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:08.480]   driver for growth of this economy and so much of the um you know the the the bargain between the
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:13.220]   people and the Chinese Communist Party has been keep giving us a better life keep growing our
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.720]   economy keep giving us more housing more stuff more food more safety more security we'll support
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:23.420]   the CCP and the challenge that the CCP is having is that a lot of that growth the core growth engine
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:28.580]   is starting to slow so manufacturing is slowing then real estate was growing and so real estate
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.360]   accounts for seven percent of the Chinese economy and I've got a good
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:41.000]   handout for you guys here in 2005 uh 250 million square meters of real estate was sold in China in
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.460]   2021 1.5 billion was sold every year it's been incrementing so the amount of real estate that's
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:51.320]   being produced and sold was increasing like crazy this year it's collapsed so it's all it's down
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.960]   like you know forecast to be about 1.25 billion now so the first decline in real estate building
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.640]   and sales so that part of the driver of the of the economy in China is now collapsing and then the
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.720]   financial services sector accounts for eight percent of the economy and that's been growing
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:10.220]   because it's leveraged off manufacturing and real estate and all the capital that's flown in all of
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.320]   which is slowing down and stopping you know this 58 trillion dollars of assets in China generating
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.180]   about 700 billion dollars of annual profits for the financial services industry insurance banking
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:25.460]   lending and so on so a lot of the conflict and the things that are starting to fall apart which
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:31.040]   may just be the tip of the iceberg is a function of a fundamentally slowing economy and the forecast
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.020]   and the outlook for an economy that doesn't have the drivers it's had historically and things are
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:40.220]   starting to come off the wheels are starting to come off a bit and so you know look the advantage
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.200]   they have is central planning long-term investments being able to kind of be thoughtful about this but
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:51.080]   in order to do that there's certainly going to be a need for the CCP to keep people in line as some
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:55.400]   of the long-term bets hopefully play out for them as they would say in order to do that they're going
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.980]   to have lockdowns and other sorts of mechanisms of regulatory control over the people but really this
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:06.500]   could be the beginning of some of the unwinding and real concern about um you know is there a core
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:11.840]   economic growth engine in China that can save them and what will it be I think all of this if we look
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.780]   at what's happening in the economy writ large uh chamath you know the global slowdown plus inflation
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:24.020]   is now causing a stress test on every country Sri Lanka's stress test you know uh showed us what's
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.400]   happening with their farming issues and with corruption and here in China the stress test
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.920]   I think you would agree is showing what's going on
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:38.300]   in terms of you know banking mortgages real estate and obviously this surging middle class
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:44.660]   and what their expectations of life are so what's your take on what's happening in China and are they
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:51.020]   you know how does this um add up in terms of our rivalry with them as our contemporary
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:58:00.020]   at a very macro level China has one massive massive massive problem which is one of population
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:08.360]   it's hard to get an accurate count but it is an aggressively aging population which was the result
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:15.440]   of the one giant the one child policy for a very long time China has sort of been on their heels
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.920]   trying to adapt that policy but really the the last data I saw I tweeted this out it was a little
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.000]   while ago Nick so maybe hard for you to find in my Twitter feed but it was a projection of China's
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.420]   population which essentially showed it contracting by almost 50 percent by
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:36.680]   like 21 100. so in the in the so it that's a really really bad situation now when you have a
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:44.120]   slowing population then the economy has to morph why is that when you have a young population so
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:51.020]   for example take what China was 20 years ago when it entered the WTO or what uh India is today when
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:56.480]   you have lots of thoughts of young people you can on-ramp them into economically productive
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.360]   activities like manufacturing the problem
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.880]   those folks accumulate middle class income and wealth is that they age out of those kinds of
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.340]   jobs like they did in America and what we seek are services and service level jobs
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:16.700]   and you spend more money you spend it in a different way so as populations age your
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:23.900]   economy has to turn over unless you have a large Bulwark of young people that is constantly growing
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:29.300]   to take up more of the slack the economic slack to pay for these folks
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:34.220]   who have different lifestyles more savings and different needs specifically health care
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:40.760]   that's China's enormously big problem so when you see them talking about six percent GDP targets and
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:47.240]   you think how does a country that big even grow at six percent it's because they're reverse engineering
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:53.420]   for what they need to create economic vibrancy in that country and so when you start to look at two
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.580]   percent which in America you'd say two percent's great we would like high-fiving each other for two
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:03.200]   percent uh that's not a sustainable level of growth for what's happening inside that country
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.740]   it does not create enough of expansion economically to cover all these folks that is a really really
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:16.940]   big issue so as that happens I think what we need to do is figure out how to be competitive now this
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:22.160]   goes all the way back to our first conversation subsidies don't make us more competitive
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.520]   things that governments can do to make us more competitive are long-term drawn
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:36.500]   out tax incentives that change the earnings capacity of companies why because in the capital
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:42.440]   markets reward those businesses Jason you just mentioned it why is the Chinese capital markets
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.620]   in difficulty nobody knows what the long-term earnings are how do you forecast it it's not
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:52.940]   simple anymore it's not a model it's not an interest rate it's not a discounted set of cash
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:58.460]   right and so that's how they need to refactor themselves
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:03.320]   they need to have a much larger population if you don't have that you have to figure out how to do it
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:09.020]   with immigration if you don't have that what China has done is they've tried to go to Southeast Asia
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:15.920]   into Africa and they've tried to create that synthetic form of a growing pyramid right
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.280]   now that can work as long as the balance sheet of the country supports that because ultimately
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.440]   you're still talking about moving money offshore okay so I think they're in a little bit of a
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.400]   they're they're in a pretty
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.200]   difficult spot the most difficult spot is the one they put that she put them in if you get rid of
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.120]   entrepreneurship if you get rid of high growth companies that create the opportunity on a global
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:44.540]   scale and then you you know take DD off the public markets you don't let education companies become
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:50.600]   public or you basically get rid of their little co-opting of capitalism and Venture Capital their
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:56.300]   whole their whole society is going to become slow growth and slow growth in a country that doesn't
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.200]   have safety nuts is really dangerous sacks your thoughts
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.720]   in terms of competition versus America okay let me get to the the competition in a second just a
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.920]   billion which Ma said the uh the birth rate or the fertility rate in China slipped to just 1.15 in
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:18.060]   2021 so last year it takes 2.1 just to maintain your population or replacement level so and this
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:23.340]   is lower than even Japan which is also shrinking as a Japan said about 1.3 the US and Australia
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.140]   are at 1.6 but we get above 2.1 because of immigration and China doesn't have that
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.700]   so they've got a huge demographic problem to Jamal's point it's going to be something like
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:38.580]   well the population is shrinking by 40 with every generation that's what these numbers imply insane
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:43.080]   the numbers are it's going to be under 600 million by the year 2100 but I would I don't understand
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.320]   how it wouldn't even be less than that if it keeps going at this rate so there and the the commentator
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.540]   Peter uh zihon has or I don't know if that's the right way to pronounce saying Peter zyhan or
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.960]   something anyway he's pointed out that China is facing a lot of economic growth and I think that's
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:03.900]   facing demographic collapse in the next decade or so on top of that like you're saying Jason that
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:09.420]   you've got um Xi emphasizing Maoist economics he basically says he thinks that the Chinese economy
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:15.780]   again he stresses the need for socialist characteristics and he seems to be bringing
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:22.020]   back that sort of communist ideology to their economy and they've basically really cracked down
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.940]   on entrepreneurship and Venture Capital it's really a cell phone I mean they've moved away from the
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.540]   policies that have made them so successful economically over the last 40 years and then
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:35.340]   on top of that you got this debt crisis and this housing crisis so it really looks like the deck
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:40.200]   is stacked against all of them and you're asking what does this mean for us well I think it depends
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.380]   on whether you look at it economically or geopolitically I think if you look at it
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:49.500]   economically you'd say that it's bad for us because our two economies are economically linked
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.900]   there's a lot of dependency they've evolved together for a long period of time and if China
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.640]   has a collapse
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.340]   then that they're so big now that that's going to have I think global repercussions there's going to
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:08.280]   be contagion but the truth is if you look at it geopolitically and geopolitics is more of a zero
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.020]   the balance of power is a zero-sum game economics can be a positive some game but but the balance of
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.280]   power is it's definitely not a positive some game uh you'd have to say it's good for us because the
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.920]   reason why China has become such a threat is because of its growing economy over the last
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.040]   40 years yep and look I mean what they've done and what they've been doing over the last 40 years is
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:23.040]   growing economy over the last 40 years yep and look I mean what they've done and what they've been doing over the last 40 years is
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:23.040]   growing economy over the last 40 years yep and look I mean what they've done and what they've been doing over the last 40 years is
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.120]   years yep and look i mean what they've done and what they've been doing over the last decade or
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.800]   so is translating their economic might into military might and that has given them the
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.280]   capability to now threaten their neighbors to become more belligerent to basically rattle
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.520]   the saber against taiwan and if their growth if their impressive economic growth continues
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.240]   for the next couple of decades as it has until now there's no question that they will
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:57.440]   they will basically try to assert their hegemony over east asia and uh taiwan will be a huge flash
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.480]   point but there's also flash points in the east china sea with japan over there but they're going
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.080]   to need a bankroll to do that so if they don't if their economy is not growing they don't have
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.760]   the bankroll to do it they're going to have to look inward and say hey we got to fix these
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.600]   domestic problems we got to get people stop protesting these streets we need to this middle
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.040]   class is demanding of jobs the great news for what's happened in china and i think this is why
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.560]   the people there are very happy about this is that they're going to have to look inward and say hey we
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.120]   got to get people stop protesting these streets we need to this middle class is demanding of jobs
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.800]   the number of people living in poverty has plummeted you know when they started tracking
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   this data in the 80s you know high 90 of people were living in extreme poverty or poverty 99
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.920]   of people were in poverty on the on the global definition of it and now you know it's just
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:41.200]   plummeted to you know a couple of hundred million people so um a couple of charts for you here but
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.280]   just and the data is obviously it's very hard to understand what's going in china because
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.320]   a lot of it is opaque but just the number of people on a percentage basis living in poverty has gone
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.480]   and now the number of people who are in the middle class has surged that creates another dynamic
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   those people want to have a great life they want better jobs they don't want to work in factories
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.680]   they want to have a a more information-based economy and a better job than 60 hours a week
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:08.000]   in a factory that's why they're moving their factories to africa and other places i mean i
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.320]   i don't know if that's absolutely true i i think that china's manufacturing sector is um is aiming
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:20.080]   to evolve so you know china has about three million factories or manufacturing facilities
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:27.360]   throughout the country uh employing about 112 million people the u.s has about 300 000 factories
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:36.080]   employing about 12 and a half million people the output of our factories is um about 70 percent of
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:42.960]   the output of um of china's factories uh in in aggregate sorry the total production output of all
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.200]   the factories so we have very um high value outputs coming out of our factories and high leverage
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:55.920]   and so china is observing and obviously recognizes that there's an opportunity probably to evolve
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.400]   their manufacturing capacity to be higher leverage higher value output and so there is going to be
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.680]   you know from the long range perspective planning and investment in technology that allows those
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.200]   factories to become much more sophisticated and create much more higher value products moving up
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.240]   from what is effectively just cheap labor putting things together in an assembly plant to being
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.600]   things like additive manufacturing
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.680]   manufacturing 3d printing automated manufacturing biomanufacturing etc and i think this is
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.640]   particularly going to be realized because china announced that they're building 400 nuclear power
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.280]   plants that drops the cost of electricity to under five cents a kilowatt hour in the u.s
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.560]   manufacturing um electricity typically cost around 11 cents per kilowatt hour 12 cents per
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.360]   kilowatt hour in that range so if factories become much more automated they start to
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.440]   become a function of the price of electricity in terms of what they can output china is going to
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.320]   have a huge advantage as these nuclear power plants come online over the next couple of decades and
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.120]   these facilities get upgraded so there is a plan right remember this is you have a plan and the
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:09.360]   reason they have that plan there is there is a question of do they get there fast enough to drive
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.760]   economic growth that actually supports all these other industries like real estate and finance that
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.400]   they become critically dependent on because those industries only work if there's a core economic
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.120]   driver core economic driver or a core economic driver or a core economic driver or a core economic
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.520]   economic engine that's working here so this energy infrastructure this new manufacturing
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.040]   infrastructure these are things that by the way they can do um really effectively because they're
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.160]   not working on four-year and six-year political cycles they can take a five ten and thirty-year
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.120]   outlook and make a make a plan and invest against it what they did from night so i wouldn't count
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.880]   them out but there's certainly a lot of challenges they're facing right now it's a big question mark
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   right now what's going to happen well and it to your point factories in china are you know
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.840]   factory workers getting paid over six bucks an hour now in vietnam three in india even less and
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.360]   that's why you're seeing a lot of folks uh i don't know if you're seeing it in your portfolios but
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:03.200]   we've seen a lot of folks looking at india vietnam and moving factories there and obviously japan
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.520]   has been uh incentivizing china's not going to just lose their manufacturing
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.480]   edge they're not just going to say hey we give up let everyone go to vietnam they're
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.920]   going to try and upgrade the capability of those factories and say hey instead of just
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.640]   putting together you know parts for with six dollar an hour of human labor let's start to do
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.360]   the more sophisticated so then free the next card that turns is well what happens to those factory
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.640]   workers if they've been automated out what do you do with hundreds of millions of people working in
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.200]   factories who now have been turned into robots and then if they're going to be in the answer
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.040]   is information economy if it's going to be an information economy you need venture capital and
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.480]   you need new companies to create those jobs and they just killed that so i don't know what strategy
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.120]   she is uh pursuing here but it seems like a bad one we could talk about this one at length but um
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.400]   we were going to bring this up but you know generally speaking
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.480]   technology drives productivity gains but it's it's deflationary
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:59.520]   explain what that means on in like a practical sense maybe uh you know that the technology so
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.080]   let's say let's say that you have to pay a bunch of people to make a t-shirt and then a machine is
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.720]   built that makes the t-shirt the cost of the t-shirt goes down because one machine can just
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.200]   print out 100 t-shirts an hour whereas it would take five people you know 10 hours to make those
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.600]   hundred t-shirts or whatever it is right so a technology of uh kind of emerges
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.960]   and those people are now theoretically out of jobs but what ends up happening is those people
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.720]   transition into new jobs that didn't exist before and we end up seeing higher order work take place
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.640]   think about the the world 200 years ago do you think we would have had any concept of people
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.960]   being uber drivers or people um uh you know creating crafts and selling them on etsy um
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.520]   people being yoga teachers or yoga or yeah yoga teachers or psychotherapists
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:54.240]   only okay well there you go only fans or dog walkers or all of these um these service businesses
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:01.280]   or you know industries that simply did not exist before and so the labor that those that that
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.680]   percentage of the population was involved in historically has gone away because it's been
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.040]   automated as that automation has happened it's allowed higher order services jobs to emerge and
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.240]   that will be the progression of humanity forever i will tell you guys um i was going to mention this
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.760]   have you guys played with dolly too yeah the other day um yeah sure i got the the login i was uh my
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.680]   brother-in-law was visiting we were playing with dolly too and making funny kind of explain what it
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.840]   is yeah so so dolly 2 is developed by open ai um we all know sam altman he's been leading that
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.720]   organization to great effect over the last couple of years and um and what they're doing is they've
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:44.240]   basically scanned the web for images tag them and then applied you know uh machine learning uh to um
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.000]   you know to basically allow um you know to basically allow um you know to basically allow um
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.240]   you know to basically allow um you know to basically allow um natural language creation
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.680]   of images from scratch so the ai can generate an image and you can go to you know uh the internet
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.960]   and look at a bunch of these but the imagery is incredible i mean the the creative output what
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.640]   feels like creative output from the system where you just say hey you know make me an image of four
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.880]   guys doing a podcast on zoom in the style of van gogh and it creates this image that is unique has
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.520]   never been created or seen on earth before and is a function of the um the learning that's been done
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:20.000]   in the world of video game development so i think the the idea of creating these neural networks to
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.280]   develop this ai that can that can create novel stuff is really amazing and i started to think
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.240]   about like what are the implications for this over time think about you know the original movie ben
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.800]   her in today's dollars would have cost a billion dollars to make they had thousands of people i
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.120]   think tens of thousands of people on that set it took years to make they built giant sets they could
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:45.520]   only you know make one film it was an incredible feat and an effort that's what movie making is you
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.520]   know it's a great way to do it but it's also a great way to do it in a way that's really
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.960]   creative and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great way to
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.920]   do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really creative
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.680]   and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.160]   way that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.560]   a great way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a way
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.040]   that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.440]   way to do it in a way that's really creative and it's a great way to do it in a way that's really
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.280]   the director the director is no longer doing this thing where they have to get it just right
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.360]   make the perfect 90 minutes and then line up all the money and all the people to do that work on
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.200]   that plan on that program they can be much more iterative and they can be much more creative on
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.440]   the fly they can create a two-hour movie by speaking to the a.i and then edit the movie
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.480]   by speaking to the ai change the actors change the color change the voices change the music
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.000]   just speaking to ai to generate creative output and people will consume that output and i think
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.400]   it's amazing to think about what creators will end up doing 10 years from now as ai and these
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.520]   tools proliferate and you see version 12 of this which is version 2 and what version 12 might
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.360]   enable and so the role um the number of people that can do that job goes from steven spielberg
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.680]   and bob zemeckis and a few other people to suddenly thousands or tens of thousands of
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.200]   people around the world making incredible movies here's dolly's image uh let's pull it up of four
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.840]   guys doing a podcast so we have a ways to go but uh yeah that is four guys doing a podcast
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.720]   that's awesome yeah that's awesome i mean and to your point like you know this is gonna we're on
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.840]   version two of this this is gonna so a lot of people are like oh is this gonna wipe out graphic
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.160]   designers is it gonna wipe out the creative industry but the reality is the roles that
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.400]   those people are in today will absolutely be gone but they will emerge and evolve into new
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.040]   roles that we never even thought imaginable that will really transform that industry and society
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.640]   and this is going to be true across everywhere that ai touches yeah and i think you'll see this
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.680]   in china as china steps up their technology in manufacturing you'll see those you know new
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.080]   new markets evolve sorry jamar go ahead designers will have less leverage to ask for all these
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:44.480]   stupid snacks and offices of startups well i mean you need only look at the designers are the worst
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.240]   my god oh they're the best i love them but anyway um in the 1940s i mean there were literally
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.080]   hundreds of thousands of telephone operators it was totally and totally they're all gone now and
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.560]   not only that have you ever met a designer that didn't take themselves incredibly seriously that
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.440]   didn't have like you know tea that they would steal
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.560]   only the bad ones you know the good ones they would seriously they'd have like steel straws
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.920]   video game designers are a little different i'm sorry what did you say about the steel straws
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:19.280]   that was it yeah oh there it is i have by the way on video eliminating waste in my life i mentioned
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.520]   to you guys last year this video game i played over christmas by anna perna pictures and the guy
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.760]   that um runs the studio sent me a dm he loves the pod oh that's nice and they just launched a new
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:31.840]   video game which i uh started playing and i'm like oh that's a good idea i'm gonna play that video game
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:31.840]   video game which i uh started playing and i'm like oh that's a good idea i'm gonna play that video game
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.320]   video game which i uh started playing and i'm like oh that's a good idea i'm gonna play that video game
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   video game which i uh started playing and i'm like oh that's a good idea i'm gonna play that video game
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.440]   which i uh started playing a couple nights ago called stray and you literally at you you play
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:44.000]   the game as a cat lost in some crazy world you're literally a cat that's awesome the imagery on this
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.040]   thing is unbelievable actually my favorite game right now sax is i play a cat and i'm a stray cat
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.800]   and it's really amazing the the ai i you know it's really hard you should go play the game yeah i'm
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.680]   gonna take a hard pass on that i like to play a game where i'm a stray dog and i meet another dog
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.640]   and i'm a stray dog and i'm a stray dog and then we eat a bowl of pasta but this long
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:04.640]   and then we eat a bowl of pasta but this long
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.800]   and then we eat a bowl of pasta but this long string of pasta we each come closer and closer
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   string of pasta we each come closer and closer
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.640]   string of pasta we each come closer and closer then we end up kissing
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   then we end up kissing
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.760]   then we end up kissing let's uh move on to do we want to go black
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:11.760]   let's uh move on to do we want to go black
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.600]   let's uh move on to do we want to go black rock has lost
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   rock has lost
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.080]   rock has lost 1.7 trillion dollars in six months
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   1.7 trillion dollars in six months
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.720]   1.7 trillion dollars in six months uh vc funding is down
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:20.720]   uh vc funding is down
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.480]   uh vc funding is down or amazon acquires one medical for 3.9
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.600]   billion which which one do we want to go to next anybody have a favorite here sachs you've been a
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.840]   little quiet you got one you want to go to uh we can talk about the blacklock thing this is the
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.640]   largest amount of money lost by a single firm over a six-month period in history blackrock uh is the
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:42.960]   world's largest asset manager and uh it was the first firm to break 10 trillion dollars in aum
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:49.120]   assets under management now right now they're at 8.4 trillion 2022 ranks as the worst start in 50
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.280]   years for both stocks and bonds chairman and chief executive officer larry fink said on his earnings
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.320]   call at the end of june only about a quarter of its assets were actively managed to beat a
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.560]   benchmark rather than track it seamlessly as passive strategies are designed to do firm's
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.120]   passive equity holdings are now 10 times larger than its active holdings although it does operate
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   some active multi-asset and alternative strategies that narrow the gap collapse in bond markets this
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.240]   year has shaken money out of active fixed income funds listen i think there's less than meets the
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.080]   eye here with this i think this was a headline that was trying to grab attention by saying biggest lost
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.920]   ever look the reason why it was the biggest loss ever is because blackrock is so big i mean and and
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.320]   what is blackrock it's basically at this point they're index funds their etfs their index funds
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.560]   they just represent market indices so you know the reason why it went down 1.7 trillion is because it
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:45.120]   started with 10 trillion so the average index is down 17 that's all it means we know this the s p
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:52.000]   500 is down 20 22 for the year the dow jones down 15-ish the nasdaq is down 15-ish the nasdaq is down
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.880]   like 30. so this is just reflecting what we already know which is that the stock market is
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:03.680]   down this year do you think it's another um data point to support the idea that active managers
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:10.160]   generally speaking and maybe holistically speaking over time cannot beat the uh you know the market
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:16.320]   cannot beat indices i mean you have a point of view on that as an investor sex well i think you
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.880]   know you're talking about public market investors i think it's very hard to be i think it's very hard
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.920]   to beat the stock market as an investor i think it's very hard to beat the stock market as an investor
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.240]   the public markets over a long period of time consistently
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:32.080]   i just think it is now you know the contradiction though is if you have no active managers
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:39.520]   then the indices won't be efficient anymore so you need the participation of the active managers
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.040]   to help drive the uh the indices and make corrections to it so and the fewer active
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.080]   strategies you have the more inefficient the markets will become thereby inviting active
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.840]   strategies so
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.520]   you know i think it's a good question i i think there are some managers who are
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   who can probably do it but i think it's a very tough thing to do jim off what do you think you're a
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.680]   public investor active selector of
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:12.080]   here's what i hear i've been thinking a lot about this i think that i have disproportionately benefited
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:19.120]   from being at the right place at the right time backed by enormous amounts of central bank money
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:27.360]   and so i think we all have been i think it is very difficult to be a public market
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.920]   individual stock picker in a world where the central banks are constantly meddling
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:43.280]   because when they do the best thing that you can do is belong the market beta and the more
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.760]   concentrated you are the better returns you would have delivered since 2008 when the central bank
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:56.560]   started to get very aggressively involved when individual stock pickers reigned the the universe
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:03.600]   was when central banks were largely on the sidelines and so there was all kinds of dispersion
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:11.040]   right dispersion meaning good outcomes bad outcomes lots of alpha right meaning your performance was
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:18.720]   independent of the market but since 2008 it's largely been beta that's driven the market and the
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.360]   folks that have done exceedingly well were those in tech because we delivered the best beta and
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:32.560]   every time we confuse alpha and beta we get over our ski tips and there's always some big out you
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:41.040]   know blow up so i think my my general takeaway is that uh if the central banks stay on the sidelines
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:48.640]   individual stock picking reigns and active management can win if they continue to be involved
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.520]   and do quantitative easing and all of this other stuff
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:21:00.080]   index funds that are long concentrated market beta will always outperform in the long run i was
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.280]   watching warren buffett answer some questions and one of the questions and this goes to the law of
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   big numbers like blackrock he was saying listen the reason i did better earlier in my career than
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.640]   later in my career on a percentage basis is because i was placing at a smaller amount of capital and i
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.040]   was placing it on smaller bets uh smaller ideas and themes and then as i had a bigger chip stack
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:28.240]   i had to find bigger ideas to put more money to work and therefore more people were looking at
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:36.080]   those and so those assets were not undervalued and so i found that very like um insightful
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.480]   in terms of when you participate in the market if you're trying to pick between
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:46.560]   very large bets like kotu and tpg and tiger were doing in the growth space sacks
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:51.840]   like now everybody knows that these companies everybody knows stripes a winner everybody knew
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.760]   airbnb and uber were winners you know in the late stage of the private everybody knew facebook was
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.320]   a winner in late stage prime market if you're battling that out you know yuri milner is going
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.200]   to come over the top and pay 2 billion more than you or masayoshi san is going to pay five or ten
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.400]   billion dollars more than you where is the alpha there you know where where is the gain the alpha's
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.480]   in the fees okay there you go and so they were playing a different game and i that's you know i
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.720]   started trading this past two weeks because i've never traded public stocks and i wanted to add it
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.080]   as a skill set so i put a couple million bucks into an account and i'm just trying to actively
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.920]   figure out how does value work there and you know i'm just starting to make trades that i want to
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.680]   hold for 10 or 20 years and we'll see if i can beat the market that's the other thing is what do
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.640]   you want to spend your life doing if the index if you can put money in a passive index and not do
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.400]   any work well you know that's attractive as well so sax what do you think in terms of active management
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:51.920]   you know in these public markets and the size of the bets that have to be like i said i think it's
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:57.200]   very hard to beat the market consistently i think it's a very tough profession i i'm sure there are
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:04.160]   people who can do it but i don't know if it's easy to predict who those people are so look i you know
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.480]   i think it's something that can be done but i just think it's a tough tough game i mean what we do as
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.320]   private investors is a little different right because not everybody is in a position to buy share
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.160]   right yeah you're not available to you you don't even know the company access is limited and
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:27.360]   information is limited and in exchange for that sort of preferential access that we get we actually
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.720]   have to do work so when you're when yeah when you're a public investor in a company disney or
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.480]   whatever you don't do any work you're not involved at all we do a lot of work for the companies and
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.440]   that's why they choose us and so it's not you know it's you're not competing against the whole world
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.240]   i think the public markets are just so competitive are you tempted though looking at these prices and
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.960]   how they're going to be able to do that because i was looking at a company that was trading at 50
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.840]   times revenue last year they're raising again they double their revenue so now they're at 20 25 times
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.680]   revenue they're raising at last year's valuation and then i looked at the public market comps and
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.160]   they're trading at six times so now i'm like wait a second and obviously you're gonna look at the
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.240]   growth rate you gotta look at the growth rate so it was three three the growth rate in this example
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.480]   was three times fat greater than the public market comp so how would you assess that then
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.160]   well what we're seeing right now is that pretty good sas companies that are growing
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.320]   maybe on a trailing basis they grew 3x and you know prospectively they're growing call it two
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.200]   and a half x um they're trading right now not trading but basically deals are getting done
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.840]   at 20 times ar 20 which are this year's current run rate yeah the current arr
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.120]   you're not getting that like bonus like here's your projected next year we're going to give it
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:42.400]   based on that this is current no no current arr is about 20 22 23 times arr um down from
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.080]   what last year a hundred oh it was like a hundred times was the rule of thumb yeah so now
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.520]   there are some where their you know deals are getting done in the high 20s i'd say or even 30
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.720]   if they're if you believe that by the end of the year it'll be more like 20. so but i i think the
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:04.800]   new levels are landing at 20 20 something times ar now why does that make sense relative to the
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.560]   public sas companies well like you said the sas index is trading at roughly six times but that's
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.000]   only twenty percent average growth right and so you know if you're growing three times the growth
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.600]   right right and the high growth sas companies are trading it like seven times um that's for like a
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.920]   forty percent grower we've talked about this before so listen if you're tripling year over
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.120]   year and you pay 20 times that'll be a seven times next year but if you're growing two two and a half
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.600]   three acts next year that's way faster so yeah i think there's actually an arbitrage there i mean
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.280]   this is why we like doing private sas investing right now deals are getting done i will say that
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.920]   the people who i'm seeing who are really struggling uh freeburg are the people who are really
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.560]   struggling with the money that they're making and the people who are really struggling with the
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.320]   money that they're making and the people who are really struggling with the money that they're making
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.400]   they're not the people who are really struggling with the money that they're making they're the
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.960]   people who are really struggling with the money that they're making they're the people who
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.840]   didn't turn on i'm talking about the very early stage they didn't turn on revenue
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:04.160]   they were making progress in team building and culture and features but they just weren't focused
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.360]   on the revenue side and my lord people got a lot of credit i mean 50 million hundred million dollar
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:15.840]   evaluations without the revenue turned on um and that now they're faced with not being able to
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.920]   make money yeah it's and raising money yeah because you have to raise money for your companies
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:26.640]   it's not easy okay unpack it what's not you know uh well what are the conversations like give us
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.240]   the anecdotal information i mean i've seen a number of term sheets get pulled so i think oh
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:40.880]   really yeah we've heard a lot about companies that kind of during the q1 early q2 time frame
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.720]   had term sheets weren't closing got the laid out
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.560]   and um there's a number of kind of examples of repricing where the investors come back markets
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:58.480]   have changed let's reprice the thing or hey um we're not going to do this deal anymore we're
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.880]   going to sit on the sidelines and wait till the market settles or our lps actually aren't going
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.360]   to let us fund new stuff uh so there's a a lot of those last one for people what does that mean
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.840]   you know yeah investor you know investors have lps they have investors themselves and
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.680]   their lps are coming to them and saying do not put
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.640]   more money out right now we are telling you we are not going to wire our money to you we need you to
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.720]   wait until even though they're contractually obligated to they're telling you theoretically
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.480]   they don't may not be contractually obligated to but obviously these are long-term partnerships and
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.680]   so when an lp you know or a group of lps says guys we're not comfortable with you deploying money
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.080]   right now you know you're in a 10-year partnership 15-year partnership with them you're gonna as an
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.320]   investor as a fund you're gonna say okay i'm gonna kind of listen to that right now now the bigger
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.600]   issues in series bc and bc are you know you're gonna be able to deploy money right now you're gonna
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.640]   be able to deploy money right now you're gonna have a lot of people that are going to be able to
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.360]   do a lot of other things right now you're not going to have a lot of people that are going to be able
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.320]   to deploy money right now you're not going to have a lot of people that are going to be able to deploy
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.960]   you know have some traction have some performance have raised a bunch of capital have done a bunch
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.360]   of work and investors don't know what they're worth they're like hey is this thing worth 25
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.400]   million or 125 million or 500 million last year you could have raised money at 500 million i mean look
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.480]   at what happened with uh one of those crypto things those crypto trading platforms they
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:12.240]   raised 500 million dollars last july and they just sold the business for a reported 25 million dollars
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.520]   after being valued at 5 billion a year ago yeah so
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.440]   the whole thing the truth might have been more like 275 million um yeah we don't know some news
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.640]   that got left yeah and and so but but series a people seem to be pretty active again and so
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:31.040]   active again but the prices now for seed yeah but it's a lot easier happening 6 to 15 series a is
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.920]   happening 15 to 25. it's a lot easier to get a deal done in a series a because people say hey look i'm
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.480]   going to give you this you say okay i'll take it i need the money series b c and d is where there's
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.040]   this whole fight because there's existing investors existing shareholders who are saying i don't want
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:51.280]   50 right down a 70 right down a 30 right down over the last round and fighting and then doing inside
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.840]   rounds and bridge notes and all sorts of other shenanigans to not have to take a negative mark
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:01.520]   on their book yeah well one thing so one thing that's interesting here is that um you think
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.760]   about like where the opportunity is in the market right now and i think one of the things that
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.520]   happened in the boom is that everyone got pushed to go earlier and earlier because deals were so
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.360]   competitive and so you know in the sas business normally one million of ar was considered the
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.160]   rule of thumb for getting a series for basically graduating to a series a that you were ready to go
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   from c to series a when you had a million of ar as we know during the boom last year that number kept
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:32.480]   going down you know yeah 500 300 000 and then you would see crazy deals get done that were pre-revenue
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.400]   with price at 100 plus we never did any of those kinds of deals because we just thought they were
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.800]   too crazy but they definitely happened well think about the dynamic now which is
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.280]   let's say that that sas startup that has a million of ar they can do
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.920]   a series a at 50 or we can just wait until they get to 5 million of arr and then pay 20 times and
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.560]   do it at 100 free which of those is the better risk adjusted return let me tell you there's a
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.840]   lot of risk in going from 1 million arr to 5 million arr that's hard it's hard there's a
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.360]   lot of things you need a sales team you're just you're not doing it through the founders
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.640]   yeah you need to start scaling a team you need a real sales capacity but also
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.200]   a lot of startups that could sort of hack together and cobble together one million of
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:21.680]   arr based on non-scalable techniques that various startup incubators teach like you know don't do
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.120]   things that don't scale programs right it's okay to do that from zero to one but not one to ten
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.000]   right well well or it's it's not that it's not okay it's just that it doesn't work right like
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.360]   you're not going to be able to cobble together five million of ar you can cobble together one
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.680]   million of ar you can use the cheat code to get there so what i'm saying is there's a lot of risk
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.240]   in going from one to five you find out whether the product's really scalable so what is the better
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.120]   deal wait till 100.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:52.480]   wait till it's priced at 100 or 120 million pre or doing the deal at 40 to 50. now if you love the
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.040]   if you love the company you want to get in as early as possible but i think you're going to
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.760]   start seeing a dynamic where in the same way that last year everyone went earlier and earlier you're
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:07.120]   going to see vc start to sit back and go a little later and later prove it to us a dead man's zone
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.760]   nobody should be putting money into deals right now what is it why
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:15.040]   what does it do unless unless you're in the business unless you're in the business of
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:21.360]   running a fee generating machine if you're really trying to generate alpha you have to have a sense
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.520]   of what's actually happening in the world right now if you're just trying to deliver the market
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:32.560]   beta and run an index then yeah you're right you should ignore this idea that there could be
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.680]   more price adjustments but if you look at the public markets which is again the ultimate
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.960]   terminal buyer they have more cash than they ever had since 2008 which means that there is no real
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:49.760]   reason to buy you're talking about private companies it all ultimately ends up in the
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.040]   public markets and so if the public markets are saying there is no reason to buy this stuff
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:00.960]   it trickles down so then the crossover investor who has a public private business says you know
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:06.960]   what on the public side i'm completely de-risked and in cash and so on the private side i'll just
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.880]   be a little bit more circumspect and wait as david said i'll just wait six months
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.880]   and put even more money in later i'll actually have a better
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:21.520]   irr and i'll make the same profit dollars so then the series b and c firm who used to feed those
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:27.040]   deals to the crossover folks are like oh well if you're waiting i don't want to have to write
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.120]   a check to support these folks my whole point was to have you mark up the deal so i could raise a
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:37.920]   new fund they slow down and then that goes back to the series a person who's like well wait a minute
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.880]   you know the reason i paid it at 50 pre was because i thought you'd step in and buy it at 100.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.640]   slow down so all i'm saying is i think that we are at the point of the cycle where constipation
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:57.120]   is setting it and this is why you're seeing such a downtick in deal velocity and dollars put to work
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.240]   this is uh great advice i want everybody to take i'm going to take the opposite advice and i'm
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.960]   going to do twice as many deals in the seed stage as everybody else but i encourage every venture
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.280]   capitalist and seed fund to take chamath's advice i'm doing the opposite because a five-person
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.720]   company this isn't advice this is just a market observation i'm just telling you
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:20.640]   what observation i hope everybody takes that as the truth because what i'm seeing is the founders
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:26.320]   who are raising and who have real businesses are so sharp right now and so focused on costs
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.280]   and profits and what matters and they have eliminated all the that doesn't there's a
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.840]   whole contingent i don't know if you're seeing it sax i'd say it's one out of five one out of four
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.600]   that are like i understand what's happening here and i'm going to take advantage of this moment
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.640]   in time and i'm going to just drive revenue and profit but what happens to the 250 billion dollar
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:48.720]   that's been put to work in the last two years that need to get up rounds yeah it doesn't matter to me
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.400]   all i care about is meeting young companies that are growing with revenue but i think they're they're
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.920]   just trying to have i'm trying to have a conversation yeah yeah no i mean that's a lot of
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.800]   indigestion yeah they're gonna have to cut their staffs by half and get to profitability ultimately
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:08.720]   the way that valuations matter or price levels matter is there's an entry price and an exit price
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.560]   and ideally if you can time it right you want to invest when valuation levels are low and you want
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:20.240]   to exit when valuation levels are high if you were a vc last year you should have been realizing as
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.880]   much as you can because valuation levels are really high there was a good uh tweet by one of
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:29.440]   uh brett gerstner's colleagues at altimeter basically saying she was talking to lps and
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.480]   asking what they care about and what she reported lps is saying is that if you're a
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:38.960]   fund that's more than five years old and you didn't distribute during the best yep window
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.480]   ever which was 2018 or 2021 it's a hard no you know we're not going to be re-upping with your
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.440]   i'll say it even more if you're if you're a venture investor who took a longitudinal view
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:55.600]   on public market stocks and then have now seen 60 to 70 percent write downs of those same stocks
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.160]   that you could have distributed you should still have something to answer to that makes
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:06.400]   no sense it turns out that the skill of private market investing and the skill of public market
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.440]   investing are different even if all you're doing is delivering the market beta it's still different
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.400]   enough we had this discussion last year remember i was saying should i distribute
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.320]   for the shares of robin hood should i hold them what should i be doing we told you to distribute
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.040]   and i distributed i distributed everything you know and uh and in terms of secondary i feel
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.560]   particularly you feel like a genius now because your lp should say thank you jason they should
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.760]   know some of them are saying that what i feel smart about i'll be honest is uh we had i think
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.960]   let's just say i'm making up a number four out of five times we were offered
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.160]   the opportunity to trim our positions in secondary with our winners uh from people who wanted to
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.320]   buy secondary shares i did it probably four out of five times um and i'm just kicking myself i'd
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.120]   into it the fifth or i didn't ask if they would take more because my god we were able to clear
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.200]   some positions at very high valuations that are now lower than that in the private markets and
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.160]   send cash to our lps and get our you know get over our hurdles and our first two funds
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:02.720]   which you know i feel smart about i think that you should feel so
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.600]   so good about that that is that is really hard what you did and i think people underestimate
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:14.240]   how hard it is it is really hard to actually return more money than you have taken it yeah
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:21.760]   i mean that's what i'm focused on just that simple statement and and by the way it was hard in the
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:27.680]   last 10 years where we've had basically a massive up market and the four of us frankly benefited
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.640]   from the extraordinary luck of being in tech yeah no it's super lucky i think the big thing that's
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.240]   going to happen right now i'm seeing it all over the place is m a i think is going to start ticking
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.560]   up just today amazon acquired one medical for 3.9 billion one medical operates a network of
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.160]   clinics if you don't know three point nine billion dollar enterprise value for a hundred and eight
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:49.200]   and eighty two franchises which is 21 million a franchise look at what happened to their um look
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.680]   what happened to their stock price no i know i went from 60 in the peak in february of 2021 to uh
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.840]   seven in may and they bought it they basically bought it at the same price it was trading at
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.920]   in january no my point is you could buy a mcdonald's franchise for 2 million or you could
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.960]   buy the company that fixes the people that needed mcdonald's for 21 million that's why they got by
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.080]   the way at mcdonald's you can't make money selling pharmaceuticals and upselling you know other stuff
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:19.280]   that amazon's gonna certainly i think it's super interesting i think it's super interesting that
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:24.720]   amazon's getting into this business wow i mean that is really interesting they clearly have a
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:31.360]   an economic model that shows um some significant footprint and retail footprint well yeah and there
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.480]   may also be kind of a supplement pharmaceutical kind of upgrade opportunity there's synergy in this
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.400]   uh business and think about the synergy between what they're getting is also not just the physical
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.000]   locations but a network of different types of businesses that are going to be able to get into
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.680]   the field and so you can see that there's a network of doctors that can do telehealth i don't know if
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:52.800]   you guys have ever used one medical but they do really um you know easy zoom telehealth services
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.280]   and so you could hop on get a prescription have it fulfilled by amazon it shows up at your doorstep in
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:01.840]   under an hour genius it'll be an incredible synergy for that business and probably a real
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.080]   value driver not just at the core units but with respect to other things they're going to sell
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:12.720]   through your one medical doctor will provision a blood test he or she will analyze those blood tests
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.920]   over a telehealth
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.560]   and then they'll be able to get a prescription and then they'll be able to get a blood test
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.840]   and then they'll be able to get a blood test and then they'll be able to get a blood test and then
