[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   memory is never a retrieval. Often we think about memory as I'm going to go into the file cabinets
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.840]   of my brain and I'm going to grab this memory. I'm going to pull it out and I'm going to look
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.400]   at it. That's not how memory is. Memory is what they call a reconstruction. I'm always reconstructing
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   my memory from the present. But there's one other really important part. So there's the whole
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.120]   framing of it, the big picture, the story, but there's also the filtering of it. That's the focus.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.800]   So as an example, if I'm looking back on the last five months, as I gave an example, or the last
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.360]   even five weeks, I can look for the ways in which I've been a loser, right? I can look for all the
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.920]   ways in which I've failed over the last five weeks. And that's me filtering for and searching
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.760]   for certain things. And that's often what people do is they'll look for the ways in which things
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.360]   are going wrong. Instead, you can proactively look for the ways that things are going right.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.120]   I can look for the ways in which I've made progress in ways, you know, and I've learned
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.400]   things that my past self didn't know. It's just ultimately up to your control.
