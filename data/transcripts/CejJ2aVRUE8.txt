[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   The following is a conversation with Natalia Bailey,
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.000]   a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   previously at MIT, and now the founder and CTO
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.200]   of Axion Systems, specializing in efficient
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.840]   space propulsion engines for satellites and spacecraft.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.360]   So these are not the engines that get us
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.000]   from the ground on Earth out to space,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.600]   but rather the engines that move us around in space
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.280]   once we get out there.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.120]   Quick mention of our sponsors.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.360]   Monk Pack, low carb snacks, Four Sigmatic mushroom coffee,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.880]   Blinkist, an app that summarizes books,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.580]   and Sun Basket, meal delivery service.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.480]   So the choices, snacks, caffeine, knowledge,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.120]   or a delicious meal.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.400]   Choose wisely, my friends.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.100]   And if you wish, click the sponsor links below

[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   As a side note, let me say something about Natalia's story.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.240]   She has talked about how when she was young,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.320]   she would often look up at the stars
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.400]   and dream of alien intelligences
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.840]   that one day we could communicate with.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.520]   This moment of childlike cosmic curiosity
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.800]   is at the core of my own interest in space
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.480]   and extraterrestrial life, and in general,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.600]   in artificial intelligence, science, and engineering.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.320]   Amid the meetings and the papers and the career rat race
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.360]   and all the awards, let's not let ourselves
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.680]   lose that childlike wonder.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   Sadly, we're on Earth for only a very short time.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.040]   So let's have fun solving some of the biggest puzzles
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.120]   in the universe while we're here.

[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.480]   And now, here's my conversation with Natalia Bailey.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.280]   You said that you spent your whole life
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.820]   dreaming about space and also pondering
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.120]   the big existential question of whether there is
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.740]   or isn't intelligent life,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.640]   intelligent alien civilizations out there.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   So what do you think?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.120]   Do you think there's life out there?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.560]   Intelligent life?
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   - Intelligent life, that's trickier.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.120]   I think looking at the likelihood
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   of a self-replicating organism,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.440]   given how much time the universe has existed
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.400]   and how many stars with planets,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.380]   I think it's likely that there's other life.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.440]   Intelligent life, I'm hopeful.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.460]   I'm a little discouraged that we haven't yet been in touch.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.520]   - Allegedly.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.360]   I mean, it's also--
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.560]   - In our dimensions and so on, yeah.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.200]   - It's also possible that they have been in touch
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.160]   and we just haven't, we're too dumb to realize
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.520]   they're communicating with us,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.320]   in whichever, it's the Carl Sagan idea
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.280]   that they may be communicating at a time scale
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.600]   that's totally different.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.800]   Like their signals are in a totally different time scale
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.920]   or in a totally different kind of medium of communication.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   It could be our own,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   it could be the birth of human beings.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.400]   Whatever the magic that makes us who we are,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.480]   the collective intelligence thing,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   that could be aliens themselves.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560]   That could be the medium of communication.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.440]   Like the nature of our consciousness and intelligence itself
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.120]   is the medium of communication.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.920]   - And like being able to ask the questions themselves.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.480]   I've never thought of it that way.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.440]   - Like actually, yeah, asking the question
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   whether aliens exist might be the very medium
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.920]   by which they communicate.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.600]   It's like they send questions.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.720]   - So some, this like collective emergent behavior
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.480]   is the signal.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   - Is the signal, yeah.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.440]   So--
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.720]   - It's interesting, yeah.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600]   - 'Cause maybe that's how we would communicate.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.480]   If you think about it, if we were way, way, way smarter,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.400]   like a thousand years from now, we somehow survive,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.360]   like how would we actually communicate?
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.200]   In a way that's like, if we broadcast the signal,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.640]   and then it could somehow like percolate
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.080]   throughout the universe,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.840]   like that signal having an impact on--
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   - Multiverse.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.040]   - Multiverse, of course.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.240]   That would have a signal, an effect on the most possible,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.280]   the highest number of possible civilizations,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.560]   what would that signal be?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.400]   It might not be like sending a few
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.200]   stupid little hello world messages.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.320]   It might be something more impactful.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   It's almost like impactful in a way
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.240]   where they don't have to have the capability to hear it.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.760]   It like forces the message to have an impact.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   - Right.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   My train of thought has never gone there, but I like it.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.520]   And also somewhere in there, I think it's implied
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.920]   that something travels faster than the speed of light,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.120]   which I'm also really hopeful for.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.520]   - Oh, you're hopeful.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.720]   Are you excited by the possibility
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.000]   that there's intelligent life out there?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   Sort of you work on the engineering side of things.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.920]   It's this very kind of focused pursuit
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.840]   of moving things through space efficiently.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.480]   But if you zoom out, one of the cool things
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.680]   that this enables us to do is find,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   forget even intelligent life,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.200]   just life on Mars or on Europa or something like that.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.680]   Does that excite you?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.820]   Does that scare you?
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.960]   - Oh, it's very exciting.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   I mean, it's the whole reason I went into the field I'm in
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.280]   is to contribute to building the body of knowledge
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.200]   that we have as a species.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.480]   So very exciting.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.280]   - Do you think there's life on Mars?
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.360]   Like no longer, well, already living,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.320]   but currently living, but also no longer living,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.840]   like that we might be able to find life
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.560]   as some people suspect, basic microbial life.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.320]   - I'm not so sure about in our own solar system.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   And I do think it might be hard to untangle
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   if we somehow contaminated other things as well.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.120]   So I'm not sure about this close to home.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.520]   - That'd be really exciting.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.360]   - Yes.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.960]   - Like do you think about the Drake equation much of like--
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.480]   - That was what, yeah, what got me into all of this, yeah.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   - Yeah, 'cause one of the questions is how hard is it
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.280]   for life to start on a habitable planet?
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   Like if you have a lot of the basic conditions,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.860]   not exactly like Earth, but basic Earth-like conditions,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.600]   how hard is it for life to start?
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.980]   And if you find life on Mars or find life on Europa,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.600]   that means it's way easier.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.000]   That's a good thing to confirm
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.560]   that if you have a habitable planet,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.600]   then there's going to be life.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.840]   And that like immediately, that would be super exciting
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.520]   'cause that means there's like trillions of planets
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.680]   with basic life out there.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.360]   - Though of all the planets in our solar system,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.400]   Earth is clearly the most habitable.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.440]   So I would not be discouraged
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.040]   if we didn't find it on another planet in our solar system.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.080]   - True, and again, that life could look very different.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   It's habitable for Earth-like life,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.560]   but it could be totally different.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.880]   I still think that trees are quite possibly
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.400]   more intelligent than humans,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.280]   but their intelligence is carried out over a time scale
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.080]   that we're just not able to appreciate.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.680]   Like they might be running the entirety
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.800]   of human civilization, and we're just like too dumb
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.360]   to realize that they're the smart ones.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.720]   - Maybe that's the alien message.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.800]   It's in the trees.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.520]   - It's in the trees.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.480]   Yeah, it's not in the monolith in the Utah desert.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.720]   It's in the trees. - Right, yeah.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.120]   - So let's go to space exploration.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.240]   How do you think we'd get humans to Mars?
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.360]   - I think SpaceX and Elon Musk will be the ones
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.940]   that get the first human setting foot on Mars,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.120]   and probably not that long from now
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.640]   from us having this conversation.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.920]   Maybe we'll inflate his timeline a little bit,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.200]   but I tend to believe the goals he sets.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.360]   So I think that will happen relatively soon.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.060]   As far as when and what it will take
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.800]   to get humans living there in a more permanent way,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.760]   I have a glib answer, which is when we can invent
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.600]   a time machine to go back to the early Cold War,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.240]   and instead of uniting around sending people to the moon,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.760]   we pick Mars as the destination.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.920]   So really, I say that because there's nothing
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.640]   truly scientifically or technologically impossible
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   about doing that soon.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.920]   It's more politically and financially,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.480]   and those are the obstacles, I think, to that.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.080]   - Well, I wonder of when you colonize
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.720]   with more than, I say, five people on Mars,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.920]   you have to start thinking about the kind of rules
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.600]   you have on Mars.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.180]   And speaking of the Cold War, who gets to own the land?
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.720]   You start planting flags, you start to make decisions.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.080]   And like SpaceX says this, it's probably a little bit trolly
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.340]   but they have this nice paragraph in their contracts
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.340]   where it talks about that human governments on Earth
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.720]   or Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.240]   The rules, the Martians get to define their own rules.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.900]   It sounds very much like the founding fathers
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.240]   for this country, that's the kind of language.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.120]   It's interesting that that's in there
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   and it makes you think perhaps that needs to be leveraged.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.040]   You have to be very clever about leveraging that
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   to create a little bit of a Cold War feeling.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960]   It seems like we humans need a little bit of a competition.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.200]   Do you think that's necessary to succeed
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.480]   and to get the necessary investment?
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.840]   Or can the pure pursuit of science be enough?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.920]   - No, I think we're seeing right now
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.360]   the pure pursuit of science, that results
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   in pretty tiny budgets for exploration.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.920]   There has to be some disaster impending doom
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.000]   to get us onto another planet in a permanent way.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.640]   Financially, I just don't know if the private sector
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.160]   can support that.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.560]   I don't wish that there is some catastrophe coming our way
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.440]   that spurs us to do that.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.960]   - I'm unsure what the business model is
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.000]   for colonizing Mars.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   - Yeah, there is for, we'll talk about satellites.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.800]   There's probably a lot of business models around satellites
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.160]   but there's not enough short term business.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.760]   I guess that's how business works.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.000]   You should have a path to making money
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.120]   in the next 10 years.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.720]   - Well, and maybe even more broadly
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.400]   and looping back to something we said earlier,
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.840]   I don't know that getting humans off this planet
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.840]   and spreading bacteria is what we're supposed
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.480]   to be doing in the first place.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.720]   So maybe we can go but should we?
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   And I'm probably an unusual person for thinking that
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.400]   in my industry because humans want to explore.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   But I almost wonder, are we putting unnecessary obstacles,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.480]   we're very finicky biological things
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.160]   in the way of some more robotic
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   or more silicon based exploration.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.040]   And yeah, do we need to colonize and spread?
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.880]   - What do you think is the role of AI in space?
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.640]   Do you, in your work, again, we'll talk about it
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   but do you see more and more of the space vehicles,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   spacecraft being run by artificial intelligence systems?
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.120]   More than just like the flight control
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.000]   but like the management?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.880]   - Yeah, I don't have a lot of color to the dreams
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.200]   I have about way in the future and AI
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   but I do think that removing,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.760]   it's hard for humans to even make a trip to Mars,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.040]   much less go anywhere farther than that.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.680]   And I think we'll have more,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.920]   again, I'm probably unusual in having these thoughts
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.440]   but perhaps be able to generate more knowledge
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   and understand more if we stop trying to send humans
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.760]   and instead, I don't know if we're talking about AI
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.700]   in a truly artificial intelligence way
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.840]   or AI as we kind of use it today
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   but maybe sending a Petri dish or two of like stem cells
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.980]   and some robotic handlers instead
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.000]   if we still need to send our DNA
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.080]   because we're really stuck on that.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.020]   But if not, maybe not even that Petri dish.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.440]   So I see, I think what I'm saying is,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.800]   I see a much bigger role in the future
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.080]   of AI for space exploration.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   - It's kind of sad to think that,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.680]   I mean, I'm sure we'll eventually send a spacecraft
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.600]   with efficient propulsion like some of the stuff you work on
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.680]   out that travels just really far with some robots on it
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.000]   and with some DNA in a Petri dish
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.760]   and then human civilization destroys itself
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.280]   and then there'll just be this floating spacecraft
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.920]   that eventually gets somewhere or not.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.520]   That's a sad thought, like this lonely spacecraft
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.600]   just kind of traveling through space
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   and humans are all dead.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.920]   - Well, it depends-- - That's a possible future.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.600]   - It depends on what the goal is, right?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.200]   (both laughing)
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.640]   Another way to look at it is we've preserved,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.000]   it's like a little time capsule of knowledge, DNA,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.400]   that we've, that will outlive us.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.000]   - Well, that's beautiful. - Yeah.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.920]   (both laughing)
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.400]   It's how I sleep at night.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.760]   - So you also mentioned that you wanted to be an astronaut.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.600]   - Yes.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.480]   - So even though you said you're unusual
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.840]   and thinking like, it's nice here on Earth
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.880]   and then we might wanna be sending robots up there,
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.120]   you wanted to be a human that goes out there.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.680]   Would you like to one day travel to Mars?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.800]   You know, if it becomes sort of more open
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.280]   to civilian travel and that kind of thing?
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.920]   Like, are you, like vacation-wise,
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.440]   like if we're talking vacations,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.400]   would you like to vacation on Earth or vacation on Mars?
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.240]   - I wish that I had a better answer, but no.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.560]   I wanted to be an astronaut because I,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.520]   first of all, I like working in labs and doing experiments
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   and I wanted to go to like the coolest lab, the ISS,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.060]   and do some experiments there.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.680]   That's being decommissioned, which is sad,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.280]   but you know, there will be others, I'm sure.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.720]   - The ISS is being decommissioned?
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.420]   - Yes, I think by 2025, it's not going to be in use anymore.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.000]   But I think there are private companies
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.360]   that are going to be putting up stations and things.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.320]   - So it's primarily like a research lab, essentially.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.160]   - Yes.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.920]   - A research lab in space, that's a cool way to say it.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.440]   It's like the coolest possible research lab.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.720]   - That's where I wanted to go.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   And now, though, my risk profile has changed a little bit.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.680]   I have three little ones and I won't be
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.240]   in the first thousand people to go to Mars,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.680]   let's put it that way.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.460]   - Yeah, Earth is kind of nice.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.000]   We have our troubles, but overall, it's pretty nice.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Again, it's the Netflix.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.560]   Okay, let's talk rockets.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.980]   How does a rocket engine work, or any kind of engine
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.840]   that can get us to space or float around in space?
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.540]   - The basic principle is conservation of momentum.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.540]   So you throw stuff out the back of the engine
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.080]   and that pushes the rocket and the spacecraft
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.040]   in the other direction.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   So there are two main types of rocket propulsion.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.820]   The one people are more familiar with is chemical
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.500]   because it's loud and there's fire.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.180]   And that's what's used for launch and is more televised.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.080]   So in those types of systems,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.700]   you usually have a fuel on an oxidizer
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.020]   and they react and combust and release
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.700]   stored chemical energy.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   And that energy heats the resultant gas
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.800]   and that's funneled out the back through a nozzle,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.820]   directed out the back, and then that momentum exchange
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.420]   pushes the spacecraft forward.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.060]   - Is there an interesting difference between liquid
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.780]   and solid fuel in those contexts?
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.740]   - They're both lumped in the same.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.140]   So chemical just means that the release of energy
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.700]   from those bonds essentially.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.220]   So a solid fuel works the same way.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.820]   And the other main category is electric propulsion.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.540]   So instead of chemical energy,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.840]   you're using electrical energy,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.700]   usually from batteries or solar panels.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.700]   And in this case, the stuff you're pushing out the back
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.780]   would be charged particles.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.540]   So instead of combustion and heat,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.820]   you end up with charged particles
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.180]   and you force them out the back of the spacecraft
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.120]   using either an electrostatic field or electromagnetic.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.580]   But it's the same momentum exchange
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.420]   and same idea of stuff out the back
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.780]   and everything else goes forward.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.140]   - Cool, so those are the big two categories.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.140]   What's the difference maybe in the challenges of each,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.760]   the use cases of each and how they're used today,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.280]   the physics of each and where they're used,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.220]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.920]   Anything interesting about the two categories
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.480]   that distinguishes them?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.480]   Besides the chemical one being the big sexy flames and--
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.640]   - Yeah, fire. - Fire, yeah.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.320]   - Chemical is very well understood.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.000]   In its simplest form, it's like a firework.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.080]   So it's been around since 400 BC or something like that.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.040]   So that, even the big engines are quite well understood.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   I think one of the last gaps there is probably,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:27.400]   what exactly are the products of combustion?
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Are modeling abilities kind of fall apart there
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.560]   because it's hot and gases are moving
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   and you end up kind of having to venture
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.200]   into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.760]   to try to solve that.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.920]   And that's quite complex, but we have pretty good models
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.140]   for some of the more like emergent behaviors
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.200]   of that system anyways.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   But that's, I think one of the last unsolved pieces.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.800]   And really the kind of what people care about there
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   is making it more fuel efficient.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.680]   So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.400]   of instantaneous thrust, but it's not very fuel efficient.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.900]   It's much more fuel efficient to go
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.000]   with the electric type of propulsion.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.300]   So that's where people spend a lot of their time
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.880]   is trying to make that more efficient
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.320]   in terms of thrust per unit of fuel.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.840]   And then there's always considerations
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.700]   like heating and cooling.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.340]   It's very hot, which is good if it heats the gases,
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.680]   but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.660]   So there's always a lot of work on heating and cooling
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.320]   and the engine cycles and things like that.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.680]   And then on electric propulsion,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.240]   - Lots more mysteries.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.780]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.200]   One of the classes I took in college,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.080]   we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.880]   and then the last 10% on electric.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.400]   And the professor said, "We only sort of understand
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.880]   "how it works, but it works kind of."
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   And it's like, that's interesting.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.120]   Yeah, and even an ion engine,
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.780]   which is probably one of the most straightforward
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.500]   because it's just an electrostatic engine,
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.900]   but it has this really awesome combination
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.140]   of quantum mechanics and material science
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.180]   and fluid dynamics and electrostatics.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.480]   And it's just very intriguing to me.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.220]   - First of all, can you actually zoom out even more?
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.940]   'Cause you mentioned ion propulsion engine
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.020]   is a subset of electric.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.540]   So is there a categories of electric engines
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.780]   and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.740]   - Yes, so sure.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.540]   There's the two most kind of conventional types
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.700]   that have been around since the '60s
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.820]   are ion engines and Hall thrusters.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.860]   And ion engines are a little bit simpler
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.520]   because they don't use a magnetic field
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.920]   for generating thrust.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.220]   And then there are also some other types of plasma engines,
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.000]   but that don't fit into those two categories.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.380]   So just kind of other plasma like a VASIMR engine,
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.640]   which we could get into.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.660]   And then those are probably the main three categories
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.820]   that would be fun to talk about.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.500]   Oh, and then of course the category of engine
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.460]   that I work on, which has a lot of similarities
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.620]   to an ion engine, but could be considered its own class
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.580]   called a colloid thruster.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.620]   - Colloid, cool.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.980]   Okay, so what is an ion propulsion ion engine?
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.980]   - Okay, so in an ion engine, you have an ionization chamber
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.660]   and you inject the propellant into that chamber.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.660]   And this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.060]   So you inject that into the chamber
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.340]   and you also inject a stream
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.300]   of really hot high energy electrons.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.660]   And everything's just moving around very randomly in there.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.660]   And the whole goal is to have one of those electrons collide
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.180]   with one of those neutral atoms.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.980]   And turn it into an ion.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.180]   So kick off a secondary electron.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.340]   And now you have--
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.180]   - Plasma.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.000]   - Yes.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.840]   - Okay.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.020]   - And now you have, (laughs)
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.700]   and now you have a charged xenon or argon ion
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.020]   and more electrons and so on.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.180]   And then some fraction of those ions
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.600]   will happen to make it to this downstream electric field
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.900]   that we set up between two grids with holes in them.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.220]   And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.700]   also make runs into the walls and lose their charge.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.500]   And that's where some of the inefficiencies come in.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.020]   But the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.260]   And there are two grids actually
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.460]   and you apply a voltage differential between them.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.160]   And that sets up an electric field.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.280]   And a charged particle in an electric field creates a force.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.960]   And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.720]   and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.560]   If you're following along and tallying these charges,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.760]   now we've just sent a positive beam of ions
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.040]   out the back of the spacecraft.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.720]   And for our purposes here, the spacecraft is neutral.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.000]   So eventually those ions will come back
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.560]   and hit the spacecraft because it's a positive beam.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.320]   So you also have to have an external cathode producer
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.800]   of electrons outside the engine
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.320]   that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.000]   So now it's net neutral everywhere
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.320]   and it won't come back to the spacecraft.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.800]   So that's an ion engine.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   - What temperature are we talking about here?
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.040]   So in terms of like the chemical base engines,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   those are super hot.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.760]   You mentioned plasma here.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.160]   How hot does this thing get?
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.120]   I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.240]   in a sense that, is that an interesting distinction
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.320]   or is the heat, I mean, it's all gonna be hot?
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.240]   - No, so it's important,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.800]   especially for some of these smaller satellites
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.320]   people are into launching these days.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.280]   So it's important because you have the plasma,
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.360]   but also those high energy electrons are hot.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.620]   And if you have a lot of those that are going into the walls,
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.200]   you do have to care about the temperature.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.520]   So I'm having trouble remembering off the top of my head.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.960]   I think they're at like 100 electron volts
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.800]   in terms of the electron energy.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.840]   And then I'd have to remember
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.720]   how to convert that into Kelvin.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.640]   - Can you stick your hand in it?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.600]   Not move the temperature. - No, not recommended.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.680]   Yeah. - Okay.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.720]   So what's a colloid engine?
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   - So the same rocket people that came up with
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.640]   these ideas for electric propulsion,
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.240]   probably in the middle of last century,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.440]   also realized that there's one more place
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.180]   to get charged particles from
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.340]   if you're going to be using electric propulsion.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.220]   So you can take a gas and you can ionize it,
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.740]   but there are also some liquids,
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.660]   particularly ionic liquids, which is what we use,
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.500]   that you also can use as a source of ions.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.680]   And if you have ions and you put them in a field,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.600]   you generate a force.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.280]   So they recognized that,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.560]   but part of being able to leverage that technique
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.600]   is being able to kind of manipulate those liquids
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.280]   on a scale of nanometers or very few microns.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.320]   So the diameter of a human hair or something like that.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.640]   And in the '50s, there was no way to do that.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.520]   So they wrote about it in some books
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.900]   and then it kind of died for a little bit.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   And then with silicon, MEMS, computer processors,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.460]   and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.560]   and my advisor started at MIT,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.260]   kind of put those ideas back together
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.620]   and was like, "Hey, actually there's now a way
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.160]   "to build this and bring this other technique to life."
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.920]   And so the way that you actually get
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.020]   the ions out of those liquids is you put the liquid
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.220]   in again, a strong electric field
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.260]   and the electric field stresses the liquid
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.820]   and you keep increasing the field
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.340]   and eventually the liquid will assume,
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.100]   I'll go this way, a conical shape.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.220]   It's when the electric field pressure that's pulling on it
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.780]   exactly balances the liquid's own restoring force,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.940]   which is its surface tension.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.480]   So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.440]   when it's perfectly balanced like that.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.840]   And at the tip of a cone,
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.560]   the radius of curvature goes to zero right at the tip.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.980]   And the radius, sorry, the electric field
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.520]   right at the tip of a sharp object would go to infinity
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.240]   'cause it goes as one over the radius,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   and one over the radius squared.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.460]   And instead of the electric field going to infinity
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.620]   and maybe like generating a wormhole or something,
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.300]   a jet of ions instead starts issuing
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.240]   from the tip of that liquid.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.780]   So the field becomes strong enough there
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.500]   that you can pull ions out of the liquid.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.660]   - What is the liquid?
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.500]   We're talking about,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.620]   or is it there's a bunch of different ones?
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.480]   - You can do it with different types of liquids.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.060]   It depends on how easily you can free ions
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.540]   from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.100]   so that you can build up a high enough electric field.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.420]   But what we use are called ionic liquids,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.780]   and they're really just positive.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.060]   They're very similar to salts,
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.160]   but they happen to be liquid
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.460]   over a really wide range of temperatures.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.620]   - This sounds like really cool.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.180]   Okay, so how big is the cone are we talking?
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.660]   What's the size of this cone that generates the ions?
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.300]   - So if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.140]   the, I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter,
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.180]   but that emission is happening from,
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.860]   of that cone is something like 20 nanometers.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.700]   - Oh.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.340]   I was imagining something slightly bigger.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.940]   But so like this is, so this is tiny, tiny.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.760]   - Yes.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.140]   - Hence the only being able to do it recently.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.980]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.720]   - So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.380]   Like, or like, how do you control,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.580]   how do you create a cone that generates ions
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.020]   at a scale of nanometers exactly?
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.500]   - So the kind of main trick to making this work
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.220]   is that physically we manufacture
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.700]   hundreds or thousands of sharp structures
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.180]   and then supply the liquid to the tips.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.260]   So that does a few things.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.060]   It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.280]   so we can put holes in the grid above them
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.020]   to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.860]   - Cool.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:33.020]   - But it also reduces the actual field we have to,
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.300]   the voltage we have to apply to create that field
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.820]   because the field will be much stronger
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.460]   if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.260]   And those tips we form have radii of curvature
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.940]   on the order of probably like single microns.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.460]   So we are working at a little bit larger scale,
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.700]   but once we create that support
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.980]   and the electric field can be focused at that tip,
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.140]   then the tiny little cone can form on top of that.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.020]   - So wait, so there's something in the,
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.700]   there's already like a hard material
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.140]   that like gives you the base for the cone
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.740]   and then you're pouring like liquid over it,
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.180]   whatever that happens. - From the bottom, yeah.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.060]   It's porous, so we actually supply it
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.580]   from the back of the chip and then it wicks.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.060]   - And then liquid forms on top on that structure.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.580]   And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid,
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.580]   so the ions can leave.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.540]   And then we've applied that field to get those ions
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.660]   and that same field then accelerates them.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.980]   - That's awesome, and there's like a bunch of these?
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.220]   - Yeah, I should have brought something.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.620]   - You could just pretend
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.060]   that you have some nanometer cones on the table here.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.020]   - So actually, kind of about this scale,
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.660]   we build, we call them thruster chips
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.020]   and it's just a convenient form factor
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.860]   and it's a square centimeter.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.780]   And on each square centimeter today,
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.740]   we have about 500 of the actual physical,
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.460]   we call them emitters, those physical cones.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.540]   And we're working on increasing that by a factor of four
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.700]   in the coming months.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.180]   - In size or in the density?
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.420]   - In the density, the number of emitters
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.340]   within the same square centimeter chip.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.460]   - So that thing, 'cause I think I've seen pictures of you
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.380]   with like a tiny thing in your hand, that must be the,
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.940]   okay, so that's an engine.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.420]   - So that is kind of the ionization chamber
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.140]   and thrust producing part of it.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.140]   What's not shown in that picture is the propellant tank
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.460]   so we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.800]   to those emission sites.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.620]   And then we also provide a power electronic system
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.900]   that talks to the spacecraft and turns our device on and off.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.740]   - So that's the colloid engine?
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.580]   - Yes.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.740]   - That's the core of the colloid engine?
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.460]   - It's, the way I've been talking about it,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.220]   it's more of ion electrospray.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   Colloid tends to mean like liquid droplets
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.580]   coming off of the jet.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.460]   But if you make smaller and smaller cones,
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.900]   you get pure ions.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.500]   So we're kind of like a subset of colloid, yes.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.740]   - What aspects of this, you said that it's been full
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.300]   of mysteries from the physics perspective.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.820]   What aspects of this are understood
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.700]   and what are still full of mystery?
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   - Yeah, recently we've been understanding
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.420]   the kind of instabilities and stable regimes
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.660]   of how much liquid do you supply
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.540]   and what field do you apply
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.000]   and why is it flickering on and off
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.760]   or why does it have these weird behaviors.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.940]   So that's, in the past just couple years,
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.880]   that's become much more understood.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.220]   I think the two areas that come to mind
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.940]   as far as not as well understood
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.280]   are the boundary between, you know, you have,
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.020]   we actually use kind of big molecular ions.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.720]   And if you're looking at the molecular scale,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.440]   you have some ions that you've extracted
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.820]   and they're in this electric field.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.180]   One ion, you know, it's a big molecule,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.220]   it's getting energy from the electric field
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.760]   and some of that energy is going into the bonds
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.260]   and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.460]   Sometimes it breaks them apart.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.460]   And then zooming out to the whole beam,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.740]   the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.080]   and there's a big gap between what are those,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.700]   how do you connect those
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.260]   and how do we understand that better
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.780]   so that we can understand the beam performance of the engine.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.740]   - Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.140]   - Theory, definitely.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.380]   We're, Axion is a startup and we're more in the business
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:59.380]   of building and testing and observing and characterizing
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.060]   and we're not really diving much into that theory right now.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.340]   - Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics,
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.320]   I apologize for the way too big of a question,
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   but to you from either, you mentioned Axion
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.760]   as more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   But from a perspective of physics in general,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.520]   science in general, or the side of engineering,
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.760]   what do you think is the most, to you,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   like beautiful and captivating and inspiring idea
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.720]   in this space?
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.440]   - In this space, and then I'm gonna zoom out
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.640]   a little bit more, but in this space,
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   I keep butting up against material science questions.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.800]   So I, over the past 10 years, I feel like every problem
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.300]   or interesting thing I want to work on,
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.420]   if you dig deep enough, you end up in material science land,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.880]   which I find kind of exciting
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.760]   and it makes me want to dig in more there.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   And I was just, even for our technology,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.160]   when we have to move the propellant from the tank
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.800]   to the tip of the emitters,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.840]   we rely a lot on capillary action
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.960]   and you're getting into wetting and surface energies.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.920]   - At a scale of like nano.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.200]   - Yeah, I mean, if you look further, it's quantum too,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.360]   but it all is--
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.880]   - Capillary action at the quantum level.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.320]   - Yeah, so I would--
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.920]   - That's so cool. - It all comes back to me,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.440]   to material science, there's so much we don't understand
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.780]   at these sizes.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:42.720]   And I find that inspiring and exciting.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.640]   And then more broadly, I remember when I learned
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   that the same equation that describes flow over an airfoil
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   is used to price options, the Black-Scholes equation,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.880]   and I was like, and it's just a partial differential
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   equation, but that kind of connectedness of the universe,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.000]   I don't want to use options pricing and the universe
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.520]   in the same, but you know what I mean,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.300]   this connectedness I find really magical.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.840]   - Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.320]   seems to echo in a bunch of different places.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.160]   - Yes.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.280]   - Yeah, there's just weirdness.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.080]   It's like, it really makes you think,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.280]   I think, through definitely living in a simulation,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.160]   like whoever programmed it--
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.400]   - I like that that's your conclusion.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   - Is using, I don't know, is using shortcuts to program it.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.480]   Like, they didn't, they're just copying pieces
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.240]   and copying different parts.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.560]   - Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.800]   - They won't notice.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   - My conclusion from that was, I'm gonna go interview
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.560]   for a finance job, so I had a little detour.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   - That's the backup option.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.040]   So in terms of using colloid engines,
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.280]   what's an interesting difference between a propulsion
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.000]   of a rocket from Earth, when you're standing on the ground,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.880]   to orbit, and then the kind of propulsion necessary
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   for once you get out to orbit or to deep space
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.800]   to move around?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:19.000]   - Yes, the reason you can't use an engine like mine
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.680]   to get off the ground is, you know, the thrust it generates
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.920]   is instantaneous thrust is very small,
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.200]   but if you have the time and can accumulate
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.560]   that acceleration, you can still reach speeds
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.880]   that are very interesting for exploration
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.920]   and even for missions with humans on them.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.600]   An interesting direction I think we need to go
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   as humans exploring space is the power supplies
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.980]   for electric propulsion are limiting us in that,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.920]   you know, solar panels are really inefficient
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.120]   and bulky and batteries, I don't know when anybody's
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.840]   ever gonna improve battery technology.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   I know a lot of people that work on that.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.160]   And nuclear power, we could have a lot more powerful
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.560]   electric propulsion systems, so they would be
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.080]   extremely fuel efficient, but more instantaneous thrust
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.560]   to do more interesting missions if we could start
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.240]   launching more nuclear systems.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.640]   - So like something that's powered, nuclear powered,
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.400]   that's the right way to say it.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.680]   - Yeah.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.400]   - But is in a small enough container that could be launched?
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   - Yeah, so I mean, as a world, we do launch spacecraft
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.140]   with nuclear power systems on board,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.760]   but size is one consideration.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.320]   It hasn't been a big focus, so the reactors
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.880]   and the heaters and everything are bulky,
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.920]   and so they're really only suitable for some of the much
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.840]   bigger interplanetary stuff.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.520]   So that's one issue, but then it's a whole like
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.280]   rat's nest of political stuff as well.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.760]   - I heard, I think Elon described, or somebody,
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.240]   but I think it was Elon that described the eVTOL,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.600]   like electrical vertical takeoff and landing vehicle.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.160]   So basically saying rockets, obviously Elon is interested
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.560]   in electric vehicles, right?
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   But he said that rockets can't, in the near term,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.320]   it doesn't make sense for them to be electrical.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:36.000]   What, do you see a world where the rockets that we use
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.460]   to get into orbit are also electric based?
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.640]   - It's possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.280]   but you need this, a much bigger power supply.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.200]   - Like nuclear. - I think that would be nuclear.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.400]   And the only way people have been able to launch them at all
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.040]   is that they're in a 100 times redundancy safe mode
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.080]   while they're being launched, and they're not turned on
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.640]   until they're farther off.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.760]   So if you were to actually try to use it on launch,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.680]   I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.160]   but someday.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.000]   - It's an interesting concept, nuclear.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.400]   It seems like people, like everybody that works
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.720]   on nuclear power has shown how safe it is
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.320]   as a source of energy. - I know, right?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   - And yet we are, seem to be, I mean, based on the history,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.160]   based on the excellent HBO series,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   I'm rushing with the Chernobyl.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.200]   It seems like we have our risk estimation
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.520]   about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.600]   But that's a fascinating idea that we would use nuclear
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.200]   as a source for our vehicles, and not just in outer space.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.920]   That's cool, I'm gonna have to look into that.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.960]   That's super interesting.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.920]   - Well, just last year, Trump eased up a little bit
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.120]   on the regulations, and NASA, and hopefully others,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.840]   are starting to pick up on the development.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.240]   So now is a good time to look into it,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.320]   'cause there's actually some movement.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.760]   - Is that a hope for you, to explore different
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.720]   energy sources that the entirety of the vehicle
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   uses something like, the entirety of the propulsion systems
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   for all aspects of the vehicle's life travel is the same,
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.400]   or electric, is it possible for it to be the same?
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.280]   Like, the colloid engine being used for everything?
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.400]   - You could, and you would have to do it in the same way
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.520]   we do different stages of rockets now,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   where once you've used up an engine, or a stage,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.720]   you let it go, because there's really no point
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.540]   in holding onto it.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.120]   So I wouldn't necessarily wanna use the same engine
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.160]   for the whole thing, but the same technology, I think,
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.000]   would be interesting.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.760]   - Okay, so it's possible, all right, but--
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.360]   - Yeah, it comes down to the power source.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.040]   - The power source, that's really interesting.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.480]   But for the current power sources,
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.000]   and its current use cases, what's the use case
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.920]   for electric, like the colloid engine,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.600]   can you talk about where they're used today?
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   - Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.320]   once you're in orbit, but that's also where you might
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.480]   choose instead to use an electric system,
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.760]   and what people do with them, and this includes
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.480]   the ion engines, and Hoth thrusters, and our engine,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.600]   is basically any maneuvering you need to do
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.040]   once you're dropped off.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:29.320]   There's, even if your only goal was to just stay
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.560]   in your orbit and not move for the life of your mission,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.620]   you need propulsion to accomplish that,
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.320]   because the Earth's gravity field changes
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.440]   as you go around in orbit and pulls you out
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.600]   of your little box.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   There are other perturbations that can throw you off a bit,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.780]   and then, most people want to do things
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.500]   a little bit more interesting, like maneuver
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.960]   to avoid being hit by space debris,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.320]   or perhaps lower their orbit to take a higher resolution
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.040]   image of something and then return.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.560]   At the end of your mission, you're supposed
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.480]   to responsibly get rid of your satellite,
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.560]   whether that's burning it up, but if you're in geo,
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.000]   you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.360]   - What's geo, what's--
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.920]   - So low Earth orbit, and then geosynchronous orbit,
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.240]   or geostationary orbit.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.720]   - And there's a graveyard?
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.360]   - Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers,
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.840]   so if they were to try to push their satellites back down
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.520]   to burn up in the atmosphere, they would need,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.760]   even more propulsion than they've had
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.600]   for the whole lifetime of their mission.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.400]   So instead, they push them higher, where it'll take
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.840]   a million years for it to naturally deorbit.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   So we're also cluttering that higher bit up as well,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.160]   but it's not as pressing as LEO, which is low Earth orbit,
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.000]   where more of these commercial missions are going now.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.320]   - How hard is the collision avoidance problem there?
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.280]   You said some debris and stuff, so how much propulsion
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.840]   is needed, how much is the life of a satellite
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.080]   just like, oh crap, trying to avoid little things
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.480]   around there? - Yeah, I think one
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   of the recent rules of thumb I heard was per year,
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.960]   some of these small satellites are doing
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.820]   like three collision avoidance maneuvers.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.520]   So that's not-- - Oh, it's not too bad.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   - Yeah, but it's not zero, and it takes a lot of planning
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.840]   and people on the ground, and none of that really,
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.280]   I don't think right now, is autonomous.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.640]   - Oh, that's not good.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.720]   - Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks taking advantage
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.960]   of Moore's Law and cheaper spacecraft,
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.920]   so they're launching them up without the ability
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.320]   to maneuver themselves, and they're like,
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.160]   well, I don't know, just don't hit me.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.600]   - And three times a year, that could become affordable
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.680]   if it's like, if it gets hit, maybe it won't be damaged
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   kind of thing, that kind of logic.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.960]   - Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite,
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.920]   they'll launch 20 small ones, yeah,
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.080]   so if one gets taken out, that's okay,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   but the problem is that one good-sized satellite
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.680]   getting hit, that's like a ballistic event
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.040]   that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.400]   that then are the things that go and hit
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.880]   the other satellites, yeah.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.360]   - So do you see a world where, like in your sense,
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.760]   in your own work and just in the space industry in general,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.160]   do you see that people are moving towards bigger satellites
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.200]   or smaller satellites, is there going to be a mix?
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.840]   Like what's, and what are we talking,
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.280]   what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.120]   What size are we talking about?
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   - So big, the space industry prior to, I don't know,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.800]   1990, I guess the bulk of, the majority of satellites
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.680]   were the size of a school bus and cost
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.160]   a couple billion dollars, and now,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.000]   our first launches were on satellites
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.840]   the size of shoeboxes that were built
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   by high school students, so that's very different,
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.440]   to give you the two ends of the spectrum.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.320]   Big satellites will, I think they're here to stay,
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.640]   at least as far as I can see into the future,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.600]   for things like broadcasting, you want to be able
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.020]   to broadcast to as many people as possible.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.840]   You also can't just go to small satellites
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.040]   and say Moore's Law for things like optics,
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.680]   so if you have an aperture on your satellite,
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.640]   that just, that doesn't follow Moore's Law,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.280]   that's different, so it's always gonna be the size
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.040]   it will be, unless there's some new physics
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.280]   that comes out that I'm not aware of,
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.600]   but if you need a resolution and you're at an altitude,
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.160]   that kind of sets the size of your telescope.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.640]   But because of Moore's Law, we are able to do
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.800]   a lot more with smaller packages,
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.320]   and with that comes more affordability
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.800]   and opening up access to space to more and more people.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.200]   - Well, what's the smallest satellite
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.120]   you've seen go up there?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.360]   What are the smallest, you said shoeboxes.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.880]   - Yeah, so I think the smallest,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   the smallest common form factor can fit a softball inside.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.360]   So that's 10 centimeters on each side.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.120]   But then there are some companies working on fractions
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.200]   of that even, and they're doing things
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.800]   like IOT type applications, so it's very low,
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.200]   bandwidth type things, but they're finding
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.320]   some niches for those.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.560]   - Do you mean like there's a business,
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.440]   there's a thing to do with them?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.280]   - Yes, these are--
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.040]   - What do you do with a small satellite like that?
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.360]   - You can track a ship going across the ocean,
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.160]   like if you need to, if you're just pinging something,
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.800]   you can handle that amount of data,
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.200]   and those latencies and so on.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.440]   - You have to have propulsion on that,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.800]   you have to have a little engine.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.280]   - No, those are just letting fall out of the sky.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.320]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.480]   - But what, so what kind of satellites
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.960]   would you equip a colloid engine on?
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.120]   - Anything that's bigger than probably about 20 kilograms,
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.440]   anything that needs to stay up for more than a year,
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.300]   or anything somebody spent more than like 100K to build
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.960]   are kind of the ways I would think about it.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.600]   - That's a lot of use cases.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.440]   - Yeah.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.080]   - What's a small sat?
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   Like what category--
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.540]   - Small sat's actually very big,
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.340]   I think it's like 700 kilograms,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.840]   or, pity my microphone,
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   maybe 1,000 kilograms down to 200 kilograms,
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.360]   or people have their own kind of definitions
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.320]   of how they break them up,
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.000]   but small sat is still quite large,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.880]   and then it's kind of also applied as a blanket term
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.960]   for anything that's not a school bus-sized satellite.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.360]   So we need to get our jargon straight in the industry.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.040]   - So what, do you see a possible future where,
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.520]   you know, there's a few thousand satellites up there now,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   a couple of thousand of them functioning,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   do you see a future where there's like millions
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.960]   of satellites up in orbit?
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.000]   Or forget millions, tens of thousands,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.200]   which just seems like where the natural trajectory
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.120]   of the way things are going now is going.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.480]   - Tens of thousands, yes.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.360]   The two, you know, buckets of applications,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.480]   one is imaging and the other is communication.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.120]   So imaging, I think that will plateau
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.100]   because one satellite or one constellation
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.240]   can take an image or a video and sell it
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.300]   to, you know, infinity customers.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.560]   But if you're providing communications
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.640]   like broadband internet or satellite cell
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.120]   or something like that, satellite phone,
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.680]   you know, you're limited by your transponders and so on.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.040]   So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.000]   and perhaps at the rate, you know,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.840]   our data consumption and things are going these days,
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.240]   yeah, I can see tens of thousands of satellites.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.480]   - Can I ask you a ridiculous question?
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.360]   - Yes.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.720]   - So I've recently watched this documentary on Netflix
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.240]   about flat earthers, you know,
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.920]   the people that believe in a flat Earth.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.040]   As somebody who develops propulsion systems
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.080]   for satellites and for spacecraft,
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.560]   what's, to use the most convincing evidence,
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.840]   that the Earth is round?
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:45.760]   - Probably some of the photos taken from the moon.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.440]   - Photos from the moon?
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.760]   Okay, so it's not from the satellite space.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   - Yeah, I think seeing that perspective,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.320]   maybe I'm answering too personally
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.960]   'cause I really love those photos.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.800]   - 'Cause they're beautiful, yeah.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.320]   - I really like the ones that show the moon
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.680]   and the lunar lander and they're taken
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   a little bit farther back.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.960]   So you see Earth and first you're like,
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.840]   wow, that's tiny and we're insignificant.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.680]   - Yeah.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   - And that's kind of sad,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.360]   but then you see this really cool thing
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.200]   that we landed on another planetary body
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.040]   and you're like, oh, okay.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.860]   - Can you actually see Earth?
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.700]   I don't know if I remember those.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.540]   - Yeah, I'll send you that picture.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.360]   - 'Cause I love the pictures or videos
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.200]   of just Earth from orbit and so on.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.040]   - Right, yeah.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.860]   - That's really beautiful.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.700]   That's like a perspective shifter.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.540]   That's the pale blue dot, right?
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.360]   It probably appears tiny.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.200]   - Yeah, and just that juxtaposition
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.040]   of the Earth and the moon.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.860]   - Yeah.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.700]   - And then you see the moon,
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.540]   and then you see the Earth,
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.360]   and then you see the moon,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.200]   and then you see the moon,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.040]   and then you see the moon,
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   and then you see the moon,
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   and then you see the moon, and then you see the moon.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   - Yeah, I would be, what did you say?
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   You said you wouldn't be in the first 100.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.040]   - Not in the first 1,000.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.880]   - 1,000.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.700]   - Yeah.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.360]   - Which, it's funny because to me,
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.160]   that's brave to be in the first million.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.760]   I think when the Declaration of Independence was signed
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.640]   in the United States,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.600]   there was like two million people.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.280]   So I would like to show up
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.200]   when they're signing those documents.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.040]   - Okay.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   - So maybe the two million.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.880]   - Oh, that's an interesting way to think of it.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.960]   'Cause then we're participating as citizenry
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.000]   and defining the direction.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.160]   - So it's not the technical risk.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.400]   You just don't wanna show up somewhere
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.960]   that's like America before that.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.560]   - Yeah, because from a psychological perspective,
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   it's just gonna be a stressful mess
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   as people have studied, right?
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.120]   Most likely the process of colonization
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.320]   looks like basically a prison.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.600]   Like you're in a very tight and closed space with people
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.440]   and it's just a really stressful environment.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.400]   How do you select the kind of people that will go?
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.480]   And then there'll be drama.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.560]   There's always drama.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.400]   And I just wanna show up when there's some rules.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.960]   But I mean, it depends.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.360]   So I'm not worried about the health
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.080]   and the technical difficulties.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.520]   I'm more worried about the psychological difficulties.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.320]   And also just not being able to tweet.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.640]   Like, what are you gonna, how are you?
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.680]   There's no Netflix.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.360]   So yeah, maybe not in the first million,
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.880]   but the first hundred thousand.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.680]   It's exciting to define the direction of a new,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.240]   like how often do we not just have a revolution
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.760]   to redefine our government as smaller countries
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.240]   are still doing to this day,
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.200]   but literally start over from scratch.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.840]   There's just our financial system.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.680]   It could be like based on cryptocurrency.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.600]   You could think about like how democracy,
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.920]   we have now the technology that can enable pure democracy,
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.760]   for example, if we choose to do that.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.560]   As opposed to representative democracy,
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.840]   all those kinds of things.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.560]   So we talked about two different forms of propulsion,
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.040]   which are super exciting.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.720]   So the chemical based, that's doing pretty well.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.020]   And then the electric base is,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.960]   are there types of propulsion
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.320]   that might sound like science fiction right now,
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.360]   but are actually within the reach of science
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.040]   that you kind of think about?
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.360]   Or maybe even within the space of even just like,
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.960]   like even ion engines,
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.800]   is there like breakthroughs that might 10X the thing,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.040]   like really improve it?
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.920]   - So, you know, the real game changer
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.400]   would be propellant-less propulsion.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.920]   And so every couple of years you see a new,
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   now a startup or a researcher comes up with some contraption
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.280]   for producing thrust that didn't require,
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.600]   you know, we've been talking about conservation of momentum,
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.840]   mass times velocity out the back,
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.440]   mass times velocity forward. - So there's usually mass.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.280]   - Yes. - That's what.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.120]   - Exactly.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.680]   And you have to, you know, carry that up with you
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.960]   or find it on an asteroid or harvest it from somewhere
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.040]   if you didn't bring it with you.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.080]   So not having to do that would be, you know,
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.760]   one of the ultimate game changers.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.760]   And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics,
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.920]   I don't know how we do it, but it comes up often.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   So it's something I do think about.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.840]   And, you know, the one,
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.380]   I think it's called the Casimir effect.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.720]   If you can, if you have two plates
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.960]   and the space between them is on the order of these,
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.680]   like the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum particles
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.080]   that pop into and out of existence or something,
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:02.520]   I may be confusing multiple types of propellant-less forces,
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   but that could be real
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.480]   and could be something that we use eventually.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.120]   - What would be the power source?
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.000]   - Yeah, the most recent engine like this
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.920]   that was just debunked this year,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.240]   I think in March or something was called the M-Drive.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.920]   And supposedly you used a power source,
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.860]   so, you know, batteries or solar panels
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.440]   to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.160]   and people claimed it produced thrust.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.360]   So they went straight from this really loose concept
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.920]   to building a device and testing it.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   And they said, "We've measured thrust."
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.240]   And sure, on their thrust balance, they saw thrust
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.640]   and different researchers built it and tested it
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.880]   and got the same measurements.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.720]   And so it was looking actually pretty good.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.080]   No one could explain how it worked,
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   but what they said was that this inside the cavity,
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.920]   the microwaves themselves didn't change,
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.560]   but the speed of light changed inside the cavity.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.040]   So relative to that, you know,
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.520]   their momentum was conserved. - Wow, okay.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.560]   - And I don't, you know, whatever.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.360]   But finally someone, I think at NASA,
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.800]   built the device, tested it, got the same thrust,
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.880]   then unhooked it, flipped it backwards and turned it on,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.360]   but got the same thrust in the same direction again.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   And so they're like, "This is just an interaction
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.020]   "with the test setup or, you know,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.280]   "some of the chamber or something like that."
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.240]   So forwarded again, but, you know,
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.240]   it would be so wonderful for everybody
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.200]   if we could figure out how to do it, but I don't know.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.100]   - That's an interesting twist on it
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.560]   because that's more about efficient travel,
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.800]   long distance travel, right?
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.580]   That's not necessarily about speed.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.840]   That's more about enabling like--
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.120]   - Yeah, so hook that up to the nuclear power supply.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.160]   There you go. - Okay.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.960]   But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to,
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.580]   so there's recently, already I think been debunked
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.280]   or close to being debunked, but the signal,
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.260]   a weird signal from our nearby friends,
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.120]   nearby exoplanets from Proxima Centauri,
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.460]   a signal that's 4.2 light years away.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.680]   So, you know, the thought is,
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:30.340]   it'd be kind of cool if there's life out there, alien life,
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:34.360]   but it'd be really cool if we could fly out there and check.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.020]   And so what kind of propulsion,
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.360]   and do you think about what kind of propulsion
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.160]   would allow us to travel close to the speed of light,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.640]   or half the speed of light, all those kinds of things
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.000]   that would allow us to get to Proxima Centauri
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.380]   and have reasonable, in a lifetime?
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:54.800]   - You know, there's the project Breakthrough Starshot.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.640]   - Yeah.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.680]   - That's looking at sending those tiny little chip sets.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.840]   - And like accelerating really fast.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.160]   - Yeah, using a laser, so launching them,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.080]   and then while they're still relatively close to the Earth,
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.200]   blasting them with some, I forget what,
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.800]   even what power level you needed
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.720]   to accelerate them fast enough to get there in 20 years.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   - Super crazy sounding,
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.400]   but a lot of people say that's a legitimate,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.280]   like it's crazy sounding, but it can actually pull it off.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.120]   - Yeah, I love that project
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.040]   because there are a lot of different aspects.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.320]   You know, there's the laser,
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.240]   there's how do you then get enough power
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.160]   when you're there to send a signal back.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.600]   No part of that project is possible right now,
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.320]   but I think it's really exciting.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.040]   - But do you see like human,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.880]   like a spacecraft with a human on it,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.480]   so it's like a heavy one,
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.080]   being like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.200]   Like do you ever see that on the radar
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.960]   of propulsion systems like that,
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.240]   or are they completely out there in the impossible?
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.680]   - Well, we're going to quickly leave the realm
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.160]   of what I can describe with any credibility,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.040]   but I think because of special relativity,
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.560]   if we try to accelerate the mass
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.360]   to close to the speed of light,
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.240]   it becomes infinitely heavy,
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   and then we'd have to like harness a lot of suns to do that.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.040]   Or, you know, it's just that math doesn't quite work out,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.040]   but you know, in my childlike heart,
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.080]   I believe that, you know, we're missing something,
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.320]   whether it's, you know, dark matter or other dimensions,
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.960]   and if you can just have some antimatter
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.680]   and a black hole and then ride that around
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.560]   and somehow, you know, turn that into some--
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.280]   - Mess with gravity somehow.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.560]   - Yeah, I feel like we're missing lots of things
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.120]   in this puzzle and that, you know--
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:00.960]   - I want to harness that puzzle.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.800]   - There's something.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.680]   - Yeah, right, well, I can speak with confidence
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.280]   as a descendant of apes
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.560]   that we don't know what the hell we're doing.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.600]   - Yeah.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.800]   - So there's, we're like really confident,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   like physicists are really confident
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.520]   that we've like got most of the picture down.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   - Right.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.960]   - But it feels like, oh boy,
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.460]   it feels like that we might not even be getting started
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.000]   on some of the essential things
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.360]   that would allow us to engineer systems
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.280]   - Yeah, and there's even things
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.520]   that are much more commonplace that we can't explain,
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.120]   but we've started to take for granted,
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.440]   like quantum tunneling, you know,
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.560]   just things like, oh, the electron was here with this energy
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.680]   and now it's here with this energy and it's just tunneling.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.120]   But so I, you know, we're missing a lot of the picture.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.920]   So yeah, I don't know,
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.480]   to, you know, use your same question from earlier,
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.560]   I don't know if you and I will see it,
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.000]   but yeah, someday.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.680]   - You're the co-founder of,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.280]   just like we've been talking about Axion Systems.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.120]   - Yeah.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.960]   - It's a, would you say a space propulsion company?
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.800]   - Yes.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.640]   - Broadly speaking.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.280]   So how do you, big question,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.980]   how do you build a rocket company?
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   From like a propulsion company from one person,
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.300]   from two people to 10 people plus,
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   and actually, you know, take it to a successful product?
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.560]   - Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite,
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.540]   I'm not supposed to use the word easy
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.900]   when you work in rocket science, but straightforward.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.980]   When you're working on something, you know, sexy,
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.340]   like an ion engine, it's more straightforward to raise money
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.860]   and get people to come work for you
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.320]   because the vision's really exciting.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.660]   And actually that's something I would say
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:09.660]   is very important throughout, is a really exciting vision,
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.320]   because when everything, you know, goes to crap,
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.620]   you need that to get people getting themselves out of bed
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.520]   in the morning and thinking of the higher purpose there.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.200]   And, you know, another thing along the way
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.480]   that I think is key in building any company
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.160]   is the right early employees
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.840]   that also have their own networks
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.360]   and can bring in a lot of people that, you know,
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.560]   really make the whole greater
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.680]   than just the sum of the early team.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.640]   - And how do you build that?
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.400]   Like, how do you find people?
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.440]   It's like asking, like, how do you make friends?
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.920]   But is there, is it luck?
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.880]   Is there a system?
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.920]   Like how, in terms of the people you've connected with,
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.460]   the people you've built a company with,
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.400]   is there some thread, some commonality,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.200]   some pattern that you find to be,
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.740]   to hold for what makes a great team?
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   - I think, you know, personally,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.680]   a thread for me has been my network
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.860]   and being able to draw on that a lot,
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.960]   but also giving back to it as much as possible
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.980]   in like an unsolicited sort of way,
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.720]   like making connections between people
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.640]   that, you know, maybe didn't ask,
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.480]   but that I think could be really fruitful.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.880]   And even, you know, weirder than that
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.880]   is just really getting, you know,
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.160]   having weird, uncomfortable conversations with people,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.160]   like at a conference,
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.400]   and getting over the small talk quickly
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.800]   and getting to know them quickly,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.200]   and having a relationship that stands out,
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.880]   and then being able to call on them later because of that.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.600]   And I think that's, it's,
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.160]   that's been because I'm introverted
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.880]   and I, you know, wanna poke my eyes out
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   instead of go and do small talk.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.800]   And so I huddle in a corner with one person,
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.640]   and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.020]   And so, you know, that's all to say that,
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.480]   you know, having a strong network,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.240]   I think is really important, but a genuine one.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.000]   And let's see, other ways to build a rocket company,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.580]   kind of making sure you're paying attention
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.840]   to the sweeping trends of the industry.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.920]   So everybody just cares about cost
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.520]   and being able to get out ahead of that.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.160]   And even more than we ever thought we'd need to
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.960]   as far as what we needed to price our systems at.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.260]   You know, people, for,
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.040]   since the start of the US space industry,
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.140]   they've been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.200]   for an ion engine.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.200]   And seeing that now people are going to wanna pay
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.960]   10K for an ion engine,
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.960]   and just staying out ahead of that
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.640]   and those kinds of things.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.440]   So, you know, being out in the industry
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.080]   and talking to as many people as possible.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.440]   - So there's a drive, I mean,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.480]   I suppose SpaceX really pushed that.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.280]   - Frustrating for me.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.660]   - So SpaceX really pushed this,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.000]   the application of, I guess, capitalism,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.480]   of driving the price down,
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.840]   of basically forcing people to ask the question,
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.620]   can this be done cheaper?
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:41.040]   - This can lead to like big problems, I would say,
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.040]   in the following sense.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.200]   I see this in the car industry, for example,
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.480]   that people have,
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.840]   it's such a small margin for profit.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.120]   Like they've driven the cost of everything down so much
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.880]   that there's literally no room for innovation,
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.240]   for taking risks.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.520]   So like cars, which is funny,
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.560]   because not until Tesla, really,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.520]   which is one of the, in a long, long time,
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.400]   one of the first successful new car companies
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.240]   that's constantly innovating.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.200]   Every other car company is really boring
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.600]   in terms of their technological innovation.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.380]   They innovate on design and style and so on,
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.360]   that people fall in love with the look and so on,
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.960]   but it's not really innovation.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.240]   In terms of the technology in it,
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.360]   it's really boringly the same thing,
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.840]   and they're really afraid of taking risks.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.520]   And that's a big problem for rocket space too,
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.220]   is like if you're cutting on costs,
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:44.120]   you can't afford to innovate and to try out new things.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   And that's definitely true with the ion engine, right?
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.240]   So, but what,
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.660]   so how do you compete in this space?
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.440]   Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.880]   And what do you say in general
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.480]   about the competition in this space?
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.280]   Is it really difficult?
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.960]   As a business to compete here?
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.120]   - No, I don't see SpaceX as a competitor,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.000]   and I see them as one day, not too long from now,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.640]   a customer, hopefully.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.700]   I mean, to compete against that,
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:23.120]   I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing to propulsion,
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.600]   NASA doesn't make ion engines
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.920]   using a batch mass-producible technique.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.360]   They have one guy that's been making their ion engines
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.800]   for 20 years, like bespoke pieces of jewelry.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   So bringing things to what you're trying to innovate
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.120]   to make them, in our case, more cost-effective
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.520]   was really key.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.400]   - I like the idea of somebody putting out ion engines
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.520]   on like Etsy.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.920]   - Yeah, my advisor at MIT would,
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.360]   the thruster chip I was holding up,
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.720]   he would wear one as a lapel pin.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.980]   - But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX,
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:14.920]   2020 has seen some difficult things for human civilization.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.840]   And it's been a lot of, first of all, it's an election year.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.560]   There's been a lot of drama and division about that.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.880]   There's been riots of all different reasons,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880]   racial division.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.440]   There's been obviously a virus that's testing
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.480]   the very fabric of our society.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.520]   But there's been really, for me at least,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.000]   super positive things, inspiring things,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.960]   which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.840]   human flight, launching humans to space,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.640]   and did it twice successfully.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.560]   What is that, did you get to watch that launch?
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.020]   Did you, what does it make you feel?
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.000]   Do you think this is first days
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.520]   for a new era of space exploration?
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.680]   - Yeah, I did watch it.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.880]   We played it outside on a big screen at our place.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.640]   And I was a little, they kept saying,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.360]   "Bob and Doug, Bob and Doug."
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.240]   And astronauts usually are treated
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.720]   with a little bit more fanfare.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.040]   So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good,
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.240]   a good thing.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.200]   This is the era of commercial, crude missions.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.000]   - It was a little bit more, what is it?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.800]   What's his name, Chris Hadfield, playing guitar.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.120]   It's more, it's a different flavor to it of--
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.120]   - More fun, playful, celebrity type--
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.080]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.800]   - Astronaut versus the aura of the magical
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.480]   sort of heroic element of the single human
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.920]   representing us in space.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.760]   - Yes.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.580]   - Yeah.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.400]   - I think that's all for the better though.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.000]   It's so cool that it's such a commonplace thing
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.240]   now that we send, you know, I can't believe
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.160]   that sometimes I'll have to, you know,
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.600]   you don't even realize that astronauts are coming
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.640]   and going all the time, you know, splashing back down.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.120]   And it's just so common now,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.120]   but that's quite magical, I think.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.960]   So yes, we did watch that.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.760]   I love, love, love that we finally have that capability
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.780]   again to send people to the space station.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:32.800]   And it's just really exciting to see the private sector
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.920]   stepping up to fill in where the government
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.200]   has pulled back in the US.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.380]   And I think pulled back way too soon
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.520]   as far as exploration and science goes.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.140]   Probably pulled back at the right time
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.940]   for commercial things and getting that started.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.880]   But I'm really happy that it's even possible
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.840]   to do that with private money and companies.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.520]   - Do you like the kind of the model of competition
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.440]   of NASA funding?
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.600]   I guess that's how it works is like they're providing
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.560]   quite a bit of money from the government
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.240]   and then private companies compete
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.400]   to be the delivery vehicles for whichever
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   the government missions, like NASA missions.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.800]   - Yes, I think for this type of mission
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   is a little bit kind of straddles commercial and science.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.160]   So I think it's good, but I do in general feel like
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.220]   we've pulled back too much on NASA's role
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.160]   in the science and exploration part.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   And I think our pace is too slow there for my liking,
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.400]   I suppose.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.880]   - What do you mean on the science?
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.560]   Okay, so did you have, I mean on the cost thing,
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.600]   do you feel like NASA was a little too bureaucratic
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.600]   in a sense, like too slow, too heavy cost-wise
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.920]   in their effort, like when they were running things
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.760]   purely without any commercial involvement?
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.800]   - So I suppose it's more that I just want
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.720]   the government to fund.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.000]   - I see, yeah.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.760]   - And maybe NASA's not the best organization
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.240]   to do it rapidly, but I think that,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.600]   you know, again, depending on the goals,
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.520]   we're just kind of at the very starting point
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   of space exploration and science and understanding.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.360]   So we should be spending more money there and not less.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.000]   And other countries are starting to spend more and more,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.200]   and I think we'll fall behind because of that.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.880]   - So you have quite a bit of experience,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.120]   first of all, starting a company yourself,
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.600]   but also I saw, maybe you can correct me,
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   but you have quite a bit of knowledge of just in general,
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.320]   the startup experience of building companies
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.400]   that you've interacted with people.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   Is there advice that you can give to somebody,
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.240]   to a founder, co-founder who wants to launch
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.160]   and grow a new company and do something big
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.560]   and impactful in this world?
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:15.060]   - Yes, I would say, you know, like I mentioned earlier,
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:19.900]   but make sure the vision is something that, you know,
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.580]   will get you out of bed in the morning
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.580]   and that you can rally other people around you to achieve.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:32.460]   'Cause I see a lot of folks that sort of cared
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.180]   about something or saw a window of opportunity
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.660]   to do something and, you know, startups are hard
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:42.300]   and more often than not, just being opportunistic
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.980]   isn't going to be enough to make it through
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:48.860]   all the really crappy things that are going to happen.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:51.300]   - So the vision just helps you psychologically
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.620]   to carry through the hardships, for you and the team.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.180]   - Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.580]   To kind of younger people interested
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.220]   in getting into entrepreneurship, I would say,
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:04.260]   you know, stay as close to like first principles
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.200]   and fundamentals as you can for as long as you can.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.040]   Because really understanding the problems, you know,
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.080]   if it's something scientific or hardware related,
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.560]   or even if it's not, but having a deep understanding
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.680]   of the problem and the customers and what people care about
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.400]   and how to move something forward is more important
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.400]   than taking all of the entrepreneurship classes in undergrad.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   - So being able to think deeply, yeah.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.040]   - Yeah, well, have you been surprised
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.320]   about how much like pivoting is involved?
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.280]   Like basically rethinking what you thought initially
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   would be the right direction to go?
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.520]   Or is there, if you think deeply enough
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.560]   that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.560]   - So our, you know, our guiding star hasn't changed at all.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.320]   So that's been pretty consistent, but we,
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:04.320]   within that we flip flop on so many things all the time.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.080]   And, you know, to give you one example,
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.240]   it's do you stop and build a first product
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.200]   that's well-suited to maybe a smaller,
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.720]   less exciting segment of the market?
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.720]   Or do you stay head down and focus on, you know,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.000]   the big swing and trying to hit it
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.320]   out of the park right away?
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.600]   And we've flip flopped between that.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.280]   And there's not a blanket answer
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.600]   and there are a lot of factors, but that's a hard one.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.600]   And I think one other piece for the aspiring founder,
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:44.800]   spending a lot of time and effort on the culture
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.880]   and people piece is so important
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.160]   and is always an afterthought and something
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.560]   that I haven't really seen like the founders
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.920]   or executives that companies purposefully carve out time
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.840]   and acknowledge that, yes, this is going to take a lot
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.440]   of my time and resources.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.440]   And then, but you see them after the fact trying to repair
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.760]   the, you know, bro culture or whatever else is broken
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.040]   at the company.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.400]   And I think that it's starting to change,
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.520]   but just to be aware of it from the beginning is important.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.720]   - Right, I guess it should be part of the vision
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.120]   of what kind of place you wanna create
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.520]   or what kind of like human beings.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.880]   Like you can't wait five, 10 years
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.120]   and then just slap an HR person onto trying to fix it.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.800]   Like it has to be thoughtful from the beginning.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.920]   - Yeah, don't get me started on HR people.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.520]   Don't leave HR to HR people, but I'll just leave it at that.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.320]   You didn't say that, I said it, okay.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:54.040]   Yeah, HR is actual HR is really important.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.360]   This is so important.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.680]   - Yes, but so overlooked. - Culture is so important.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.480]   - And then I also was surprised.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.080]   Like I thought you could say,
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.520]   here will be our culture and our values
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.840]   and that it was kind of distinct
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.200]   from who I and my co-founder were as people.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.960]   And I was like, no, that's not how that works.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.520]   We just kind of like ooze out our behaviors
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.280]   and then the company grows around that.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.920]   So you have to do a lot of like introspection
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.960]   and self work to not end up with a shitty culture.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.640]   - It's kind of a, it's a relationship,
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.720]   but it's supposed to relationship with two people.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.640]   It's relationship with many people.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.480]   - Yeah.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.640]   - And you communicate so much indirectly by who you are.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.880]   You have to be, you have to live it.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.440]   As somebody, I think about this a lot
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.280]   'cause generally I'm full of love
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.120]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.960]   But like, I also get like really passionate.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.600]   And when I see somebody in the context of work, especially,
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.440]   when I see somebody who I know can do a much better job
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.360]   and they don't do a great job,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.680]   I can lose my shit in a way that's like Steve Jobsian.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.960]   And you have to think about exactly the right way
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.440]   to lose your shit if you're going to, or if at all.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.880]   You have to really think through that
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.600]   'cause it sends a big signal.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.400]   You know, sometimes that's okay.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.160]   Like if you do it deliberately,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.240]   like if you're going to do it deliberately,
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   if you're going to say like, I'm going to be the kind
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.960]   of person that allows this and pays the cost of it,
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.800]   but you can't just think it's not gonna have a cost.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.480]   - Yes, this was like the first thing I worked on
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   with my leadership coach was how not to just snap at people
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.680]   when they were being an idiot.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.640]   And first I got really good at apologizing.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.680]   That was the first step because it was gonna take longer
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.800]   to fix the behavior. - That's brilliant.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.000]   - And then she, I'm actually a lot better at it now.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.520]   And it started with things, she's like,
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.880]   every time you walk through a doorway,
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.360]   think calm and take breaths before responding.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.760]   And there were all sorts of these little things we did.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.640]   And it was mostly just changing the habit.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.480]   - Yeah.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.200]   Boy, it's a long road.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   Okay, so people love it when we talk about books.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.720]   Is there books, maybe three or so,
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.400]   technical fiction, philosophical
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.320]   that had an impact on your life and you might recommend?
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.080]   And for each, is there an idea or so
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.640]   that you take away from it?
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.540]   - Yes, so I've been a voracious reader all my life.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.200]   And I'm always reading like three or four
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.440]   or five books at a time.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.400]   And now I use Audible a lot too
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.440]   and podcasts and things like that.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   So I think the first one that stands out to me is,
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.120]   it's a novel, "Tender is the Night" by Fitzgerald.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.560]   And I read it when I was much younger,
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.960]   but I went back and read it recently.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.040]   And it's not that good.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.240]   So I'm not sure why it has like such an important place
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.600]   in my literary history.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.560]   But I love Fitzgerald as an author
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:17.280]   because he has very like flowery prose
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.240]   that I can just picture what he's saying,
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.960]   but he does it in such a creative way.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.760]   I remember that one in particular
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.380]   'cause I read a ton as a kid too,
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.600]   but it kind of set me,
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.540]   is like the beginning of my adult reading life
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.060]   and getting into classics.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   And I do feel like they seem intimidating maybe.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.560]   And then I realized that they're all just like love stories.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.860]   So--
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.780]   - Yeah, isn't everything a love story?
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.860]   - Yeah, it's really.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:59.140]   Even, I don't know, I was surprised
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.340]   that even like a lot of the Russian authors,
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.780]   they're all just love stories.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.940]   - We're humans are pretty simple.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:06.860]   There's not much to worry,
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.500]   there's not much to work with.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.700]   - So I think maybe that was it.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:12.780]   It made like that whole world less intimidating to me
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:17.140]   and cemented my love for reading.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.780]   - People should have just approached the classics.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.820]   Like there's probably a love story in here.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.660]   - Chick flicks, yeah.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.980]   (both laughing)
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:24.580]   - Somehow it boils down to a chick flick.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.500]   So just relax and enjoy the ride.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.460]   - And then--
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.300]   - So what else?
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.740]   - Changing gears quite a bit.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.860]   "The Beginning of Infinity," do you know it?
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.420]   By David Deutsch.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.340]   So he's a physicist, I think at Cambridge or Oxford.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:45.020]   And so I was introduced like more formally
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.580]   to a lot of the ideas,
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:48.740]   like a lot of the things we've talked about,
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:53.740]   he has a lot more like formalism and physics rigor around.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:59.020]   And so I got introduced to more like jargon
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.080]   of how to think about some of these ideas,
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:07.780]   you know, like memes and DNA as ultimate meme,
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:15.580]   the concept of infinity and objective beauty,
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:19.180]   but he has a really strong grounding in physics.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.020]   And then--
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:20.840]   - So he has a rigorous way
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.620]   of talking about these like big topics.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:27.620]   - Yeah, so that was very mind opening to me to read that.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:30.100]   But it also, I think is probably part
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.500]   of why I ended up marrying my husband
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.540]   is related to that book.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.380]   And then I've had some other really great connections
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.940]   with people because I had read it and so had they.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:44.220]   - I like how you turn even that book into a love story.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.660]   - I did, oh no.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.500]   - Somehow.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.700]   - No, it's good, it's good.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.300]   Your robot has a heart.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:55.620]   - And okay, the third series is, it's just, it's Harry Potter.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:59.740]   - Of course, which somehow connects to,
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.940]   I haven't read Harry Potter, I'm really sorry.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:02.860]   - Oh no.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.700]   - Forgive me, forgive me.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.380]   But I've read Tolkien,
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.900]   but just Harry Potter, just haven't gotten to it.
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:12.220]   But your company name is somehow,
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.140]   I think, connected to Harry Potter, right?
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.300]   I think I heard this.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:21.420]   - I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.060]   The first three books came out when I was 10,
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.980]   so I went along this journey with Harry age-wise.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   And I read them all, like nine or 10 times, all seven books.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:39.380]   And I think anything that just keeps you reading
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.540]   is what's important.
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.580]   And I have lulls where I don't feel like reading anything,
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.580]   so I'll reread a Harry Potter
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:51.140]   or a trashy detective novel or something,
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.380]   and I don't really care.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.140]   And that's why I mentioned Harry Potter,
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.620]   because whatever just keeps me reading,
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.700]   I think, is important.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.820]   And it was a big part of my life growing up.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.260]   And then, yes, Axiom,
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:09.700]   the official story of the naming of the company
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:14.700]   is that Axiom is like a concatenation of accelerate and ion,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.860]   but it actually came from Accio, the summoning charm.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.540]   And then we just added an N, and it was perfect.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.700]   - What's the summoning charm?
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.500]   That's one of the spells in the book?
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.420]   - Yeah, probably most notably,
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:33.460]   Harry uses it to summon his broomstick
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:37.340]   out of his dorm room when he's battling a dragon
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:38.180]   somewhere else.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.220]   So he says the spell, and the broomstick comes to him.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:41.780]   So summoning in that way.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.780]   Okay, there we go.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.780]   - This is brilliant.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.860]   So the big thing is that it's something
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.580]   that you carry with you.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.900]   It's like your safe place you return to,
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.340]   something like the Harry Potter.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.580]   - That, I reread them still.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.460]   Whatever keeps me reading, I think,
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:03.020]   is the most important thing.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:03.860]   - Yeah, I got it.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:07.660]   So I'm actually the same way in terms of the habit of it.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:12.620]   It's important to just keep reading.
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   But I have found myself struggling a little bit too,
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.140]   because I listen to a lot of audio books now,
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:24.140]   I've struggled to then switch back to reading seriously.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.540]   'Cause I read so many papers,
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.980]   I read so many other things,
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.580]   it feels like if I'm gonna sit down
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.540]   and have the time to actually focus on the reading,
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:36.740]   I should be reading blog posts or papers
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.980]   or more condensed kind of things.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.700]   But there's a huge value to just reading long form still.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:47.460]   - Yeah, and my husband was never that into fiction,
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:50.580]   but then someone told him, or he heard,
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:55.180]   you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:56.780]   So you could think of it that way.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.740]   - Well, yeah, that's kind of what, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.620]   And it's also, fiction is a nice,
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:04.040]   unlike not, less so with nonfiction,
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.340]   is a chance to travel.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.260]   I see it as kind of traveling.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.740]   'Cause you go to this other world,
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.700]   and it's nice 'cause it's like much more efficient.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.940]   You don't have to get on a plane,
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.780]   you don't have to,
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:17.540]   and you get to meet all kinds of new people.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.860]   It's like people say they love traveling,
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.300]   and I say I love traveling too,
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.140]   I just, yeah, read fiction.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:28.140]   - I told my three-year-old that that was why
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.540]   we read so much, 'cause we see the places in our mind,
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:36.220]   and I'm like, it's basically like we're watching a movie,
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.060]   that's how it feels.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.580]   And she's like, I prefer watching Frozen with popcorn,
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.060]   was her response to that.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.540]   Okay, well, you're three.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.260]   - It's a good point.
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.620]   But yeah, there's some power to the imagination, right?
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.460]   That's not just like watching a movie,
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:53.260]   because something about our imagination,
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:56.740]   'cause it's the words and the world that's painted
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:00.100]   somehow mixing in with our own understanding
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.580]   of our own hopes and dreams, our fears,
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:06.260]   it like mixes up in there in the way we build up that world
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.620]   from just the page.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.260]   - Yeah, you're really creating the world
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:13.340]   just with the prompts from the book, right?
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.900]   Yeah, that's different than watching a movie.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.380]   - Yeah, which is why it hurts sometimes
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.220]   to watch the movie version,
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:23.660]   and then you're like, that's not at all how I imagined it.
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:26.740]   - Well, we kind of brought this up in terms of
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:31.740]   depending on what the goals are.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.060]   Let me ask the big, you're friends with Manolis,
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.620]   he's obsessed with this question,
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.460]   so let me ask the big ridiculous question
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.540]   about the meaning of life.
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:44.140]   Do you ever think about this one?
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   Do you ever ponder the reason we're here,
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.860]   the sons of apes on this spinning ball
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.060]   in the middle of nowhere?
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.620]   - Yeah, I don't think one ends up
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.820]   in the field of space propulsion
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:04.500]   without thinking of these existential questions.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.820]   Yeah, all the time.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.260]   - Or builds a business.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.380]   - Yeah, I know, right?
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:12.940]   Yeah, we've touched on a lot of the different pieces
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:13.820]   of this, I think.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:18.820]   So I have a bunch of thoughts.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.260]   I do think that the goal isn't,
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:28.260]   the meaning isn't anymore just to be like a Petri dish
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:31.380]   of bacteria that reproduces,
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:36.380]   and where survival and reproduction are the main objectives.
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:40.780]   And maybe it's because now we're able to answer these,
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:45.200]   ask those questions, that's maybe the turning point.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.860]   And instead, I think it's really the pursuit
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.380]   and generation of knowledge.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:57.180]   And so if we're taken out by an asteroid or something,
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:03.100]   I think that it will have been a meaningful endeavor
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.860]   if somehow our knowledge about the universe
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.620]   is preserved somehow,
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:14.620]   and the next civilization isn't starting over again.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.260]   - So that's interesting.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.660]   That's, I always, yeah, I resonate with that,
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:24.300]   that I always loved the mission of Google
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:27.660]   from the early days of making the world's
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:30.660]   sort of information and knowledge searchable.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.700]   I always loved that idea.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.620]   I always loved, I was donated, as people should,
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.640]   to Wikipedia.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.460]   I just love Wikipedia.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:41.020]   I feel like it's the,
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:44.060]   that's one of the greatest accomplishments
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.340]   of just a humanity of us together,
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   especially Wikipedia and this open,
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.140]   like in this open community way,
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.820]   putting together different knowledges.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:53.940]   Like on everything we've talked about today,
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:57.540]   I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page about ion engines,
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.380]   and I'm sure it's pretty good.
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.220]   - Yeah.
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.420]   - Like it's, I don't know, that's incredible.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:05.180]   And obviously that can be preserved pretty efficiently,
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.540]   at least Wikipedia.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.780]   I know you just, you'll be like,
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:11.500]   the human civilization is all like burning up in flames
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.300]   as there's this one USB drive slowly traveling out.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:15.140]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.420]   - With Wikipedia on it.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.700]   - Yep.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.460]   That's on, from the beginning of our chat,
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:24.900]   that one lonely spacecraft, it just means Wikipedia.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.620]   And then it will have been a civilization well spent.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.860]   - So pushing that knowledge along,
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.700]   - Yeah.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.020]   - Through like one little discovery at a time
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.060]   is one of, is a core aspect to the meaning of it all.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.860]   - Yes, and I also, I haven't yet figured out
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.060]   what the connection, you know,
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.940]   an explanation I'm happy with yet for how it's connected,
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:53.940]   but evolving beyond just the survival piece too,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:59.420]   I think like we touched on the emotional aspect,
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:04.180]   something in there about cooperation and, you know, love.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:08.900]   And so I, in my day to day, that just boils down to,
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.340]   you know, the pursuit of knowledge
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:16.340]   or improving the human condition and being kind.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.180]   - Love and knowledge.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:19.900]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:23.780]   So I'm pretty at peace with that as the meaning right now.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:24.620]   Makes sense to me.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:28.020]   - While you work on spacecraft propulsion.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.860]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.140]   - Like literal rocket science.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.140]   Natalia, this is amazing conversation.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.780]   You work on such an exciting engineering field.
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:40.140]   And I think this is like what 20th,
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:43.140]   21st century will be remembered for is space exploration.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.860]   So this is super exciting space that you're working on.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.900]   So, and thank you so much
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.980]   for spending your time with me today.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.940]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.780]   This was fun.
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.300]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.540]   with Natalia Bailey.
