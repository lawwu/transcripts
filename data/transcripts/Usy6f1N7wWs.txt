[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   If you'd been living 300 years ago and you'd been talking about the best way to help people,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.360]   a lot of people might have been talking about various forms of helping low-income people.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   Maybe they probably would have been talking about spreading various religious beliefs.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.640]   And I think it would have seemed crazy to think that what you should be thinking about,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.680]   for example, was the steam engine and how that might change the world.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.600]   But I think the Industrial Revolution was actually just an enormous deal and probably
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.360]   was the right thing to be thinking about, if there's any way to be thinking about it.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.080]   If there was any way to be thinking about how that would change the world and what one
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640]   might do to make that a world that could be better.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.960]   So that's basically where I'm at on this stuff, is I just think as a world, as a global civilization,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.240]   we should have a really high priority on just saying, "We live in a weird time.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.420]   Growth has been exploding, accelerating over the last blink of an eye.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.400]   We really need to be nervous and vigilant about what comes next and thinking about all
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.320]   the things that could radically transform the world.
