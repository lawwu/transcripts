[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   The lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War is that
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing more men and
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.240]   more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military force.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.760]   And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that, but it didn't actually solve any of
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.480]   those political problems. You said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state in the US.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.600]   Can you explain? The following is a conversation with Christopher Capozola, a historian at MIT
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.760]   specializing in the history of politics and war in modern American history, especially about the
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.440]   role of World War I in defining the trajectory of the United States and our human civilization
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.600]   in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.120]   please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Christopher Capozola.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.280]   Let's start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I start? On the one hand,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.040]   World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914 that brought sort of the
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.520]   major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think it's more useful
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.200]   to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.720]   particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.680]   affairs and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry over the
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.920]   colonial world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time you get to
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.840]   the summer of 1914, in a lot of ways, I say the war has already begun. And this is just the match
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.080]   that lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within like the leaders and within
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.640]   the populace. They started accepting sort of slowly through the culture propagated this idea
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.840]   that we can go to war, it's a good idea to go to war, it's a good idea to expand and dominate
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.640]   others, that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.040]   that military action is the way that nations operate at the global scale.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   Yes, yes and. So yes, there's a sense that the military can be the solution to political
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.960]   conflict in Europe itself. And the and is that war and military conflict are already happening.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.080]   That there's war, particularly in Africa, in North Africa, in the Middle East, in the Balkans,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.000]   conflict is already underway. And the European powers haven't faced off against each other.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   They've usually faced off against an asymmetrical conflict against much less powerful states.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.880]   But in some ways that war is already underway.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.240]   So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War I is brought up as a case study where it
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.720]   seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental event led to
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.200]   the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your sense is
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.600]   that the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened almost no
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.560]   matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes, historians never like to say things are
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.680]   inevitable. And certainly, you know, there were people who could have chosen a different path,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.840]   both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.280]   conflicts in the system of empires in the world in 1914. I can't see, you know, it didn't have
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   to be this war, but it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   Empire, there's France and Great Britain, US, could US be called an empire at that moment yet?
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after 1898 with the acquisition of
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   the former territories of the Spanish Empire, you know, the United States has formal colonial
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.680]   possessions. And it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that would define
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.720]   empire in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.680]   or the responsibility of starting World War I into the hands of the German Empire
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.600]   and Kaiser Wilhelm II? You know, that's a really tough call to make. And, you know,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.280]   deciding that is going to keep historians in business for the next 200 years. I think
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.320]   there are people who would lay all of the blame on the Germans, right? And, you know,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.280]   would point toward a generation of arms buildup, you know, alliances that Germany made and promises
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.040]   that they made to their allies in the Balkans, to the Austro-Hungarians. And so, yes, there's an
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   awful lot of responsibility there. There has been a trend lately to say, no, it's no one's fault,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.480]   right? That, you know, that all of the various powers literally were sleepwalking into the war,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.080]   right? They backed into it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a little too much off the hook,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.560]   right? And so I think in between is, you know, I would put the blame on the system of empires
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.640]   itself, on the system. But in that system, the actor that sort of carries the most responsibility
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.320]   is definitely Imperial Germany. So the leader of Austro-Hungarian Empire, Franz Josef I,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:08.320]   his nephew is Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was assassinated. And so that didn't have to lead
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:18.560]   to a war. And then the leader of the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm II, pressured sort of,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:28.240]   started talking trash and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in the explosion.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.240]   Plus all the other players. So what can you describe the dynamics of how that unrolled?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.880]   Well, US, what's the role of US? What's the role of France? What's the role of Great Britain,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.720]   Germany, and Austro-Hungarian Empire? Yeah, over the course of about four weeks,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.320]   right, following the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.560]   political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums, sort of demanding sort of that one or other power
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.200]   sort of stand down in response to the demands of either, you know, Britain, France, or in turn,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.160]   Germany or Russia, at the same time that those alliances kind of trigger automatic responses
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.640]   from the other side. And so it escalates. And once that escalation is combined with the call up of
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.360]   military troops, then none of those powers wants to be sort of the last one to kind of get ready
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.680]   for conflict. So even throughout it, they think they are getting ready in a defensive maneuver.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.400]   And they think if there is conflict, well, it might be a skirmish, it might be, you know,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.040]   sort of a standoff. It could be solved with diplomacy later, because diplomacy is failing now.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.200]   That turns out not to be the case. Diplomacy fails. It's not a skirmish. It becomes a massive
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.760]   war. And the Americans are watching all of this from the sidelines. They have very little
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.440]   influence over what happens that summer. How does it go from a skirmish between a few nations
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.320]   to a global war? Is there a place where there's a phase transition?
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.440]   Yeah, I think the phase transition is in over the course of the fall of 1914,
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   when the Germans make an initial sort of bold move into France. In many ways, they're fighting
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:29.040]   the last war, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. And they really do sort of, you know, kind of want to
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.080]   have a quick sort of lightning strike in some ways against France to kind of bring the war to a speedy
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.960]   conclusion. France turns out to be able to fight back more effectively than the Germans expected.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.800]   And then the battle lines sort of harden. And then behind that, the French and the Germans,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.200]   as well as the British on the side of the French, start digging in, literally, right,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.320]   and digging trenches, trenches that at first are, you know, three feet deep to, you know,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.640]   to avoid shelling from artillery, then become six feet, 10 feet deep, you know, two miles wide,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.720]   that include telegraph wires that include whole hospitals in the back. And then at that point,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.760]   you know, the front is locked in place. And the only way to break that is sort of basically dialing
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   the war up to 11, right, sort of massive numbers of troops, massive efforts, none of which work,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.120]   right. And so the war is stuck in this, but that's the phase transition right there.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.320]   What were the machines of war in that case? You mentioned trenches. What were the guns used?
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:50.400]   What was the size of guns? What are we talking about? What did Germany start accumulating that
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.520]   led up to this war? One of the things that we see immediately is the industrial revolution
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:05.280]   of the previous 30 or 40 years brought to bear on warfare, right. And so you see sort of machine
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:12.320]   guns, you see artillery, you know, these are the kind of the key weapons of war on both sides,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   right. The vast majority of battlefield casualties are from artillery shelling from one side to
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   another, not, you know, sort of rifle or even sort of, you know, machine gun kind of attacks.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:32.080]   In some ways, the weapons of war are human beings, right. You know, tens of thousands of them poured
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.160]   over the top in these sort of waves to kind of try to break through the enemy lines. And it would
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   work for a little while, you know, but holding the territory that had been gained often proved to be
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.000]   even more demanding than gaining it. And so often, you know, each side would retreat
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.120]   back into the trenches and wait for another day. And how did Russia, how did Britain,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.200]   how did France get pulled into the war? I suppose the France one is the easy one. But what is the
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.080]   order of events here? How it becomes a global war? - Yeah, so Britain, France and Russia are at this
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:20.320]   time and they're in alliance. And so the conflicts, you know, in the summer of 1914 that lead sort of
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.240]   to the declarations of war happened sort of one after another, right, in August, in late August
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.720]   of 1914. And all three powers essentially come in at the same time because they have promised to do
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:40.320]   so through a series of alliances conducted secretly in the years before 1914 that committed them to
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.800]   defend one another. Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire have their own sort of set of
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.280]   secret agreements that also commit them to defend one another. And what this does is it sort of
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.360]   brings them all into conflict at the exact same moment. They're also, for many of these countries,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.760]   bringing not just their national armies but also their empires into the conflict, right. So Britain
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.600]   and France, of course, have enormous sort of global empires that begin mobilizing soldiers
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.000]   as well as raw materials. Germany has less of an overseas empire. Russia and the Ottoman Empire,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.640]   of course, have their own sort of hinterland, you know, within the empire. And very soon,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.480]   you know, sort of all of the warring powers are bringing the entire world into the conflict.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.040]   Did they have a sense of how deadly the war is? I mean, this is another scale of death
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:42.000]   and destruction. At the beginning, no, but very quickly. The scale of the devastation of these
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.920]   sort of massive over-the-top attacks on the trenches is apparent to the military officers
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.560]   and it very quickly becomes apparent even at home. You know, there is, of course,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.960]   censorship of the battlefields and, you know, specific details don't reach people.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.240]   But, you know, for civilians and in any of the warring powers, they know fairly soon
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.880]   how destructive the war is. And to me, that's always been a real sort of puzzle, right. So
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.600]   that by the time the United States comes to decide whether to join the war in 1917,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.640]   they know exactly what they're getting into, right. They're not backing into the war in the ways that
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.320]   the European powers did. You know, they've seen the devastation, they've seen photographs,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.640]   they've seen injured soldiers, and they make that choice anyway.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:39.680]   When you say "they," do you mean the leaders or the people? Did the death and destruction reach
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.480]   the minds of the American people by that time?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:50.560]   Yes, absolutely. You know, we don't in 1917 have the mass media that we have now, but, you know,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.880]   there are images in newspapers, there are newsreels that play at the movie theaters,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:03.040]   and of course some of it is sanitized. But that combined with press accounts, often really quite
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.600]   descriptive press accounts, gory accounts, reached, you know, anyone who cared to read them.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.960]   You know, certainly plenty of people didn't follow the news, felt it was far away,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.440]   but most Americans who cared about the news knew how devastating this war was.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.520]   Yeah, there's something that happens that I recently visited Ukraine for a few weeks.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:31.920]   There's something that happens with the human mind as you get away from the actual front,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.640]   where the bullets are flying, like literally one kilometer away, you start to not feel the war.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.000]   You'll hear an explosion, you'll see an explosion, you start to like get assimilated to it,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.360]   or you start to get used to it. And then when you get as far away from like currently what is
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.600]   Kiev, you start to, you know the war's going on, everybody around you is fighting in that war,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.840]   but it's still somehow distant. And I think with the United States, with the ocean between,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.000]   even if you have the stories everywhere, it still is somehow distant. Like the way a movie is,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.240]   maybe, yeah, like a movie or a video game, it's somewhere else, even if your loved ones are going,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.400]   or you are going to fight. - Yeah, that is absolutely the case.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.640]   And in some ways that's true even for the home fronts in Europe, you know, except for the areas
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.920]   where, you know, in Belgium and France, where the war is, you know, right there in your backyard.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   For other people, yeah, there's a distance. And soldiers, of course, feel this very strongly,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.640]   European soldiers, when they're able to go home on leave, often, you know, deeply resent
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.400]   what they see as the luxury that civilians are living in during the war.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   - So how did US enter the war? Who was the president? What was the dynamics involved?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.680]   And could it have stayed out? - To answer your last question first,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.800]   yes, right? That the United States could have stayed out of the First World War
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:15.120]   as a military power. The United States could not have ignored the war completely, right? It shaped
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:22.240]   everything, right? It shaped trade, it shaped goods and services, agriculture, you know, whether,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.040]   you know, there was a crop coming, whether there were immigrants coming across the Atlantic to work
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.760]   in American factories, right? So the US can't ignore the war. But the US makes a choice in 1917
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.960]   to enter the war by declaring war, right, on Germany and Austria. And in that sense,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.960]   this is a war of choice, but it's kicked off by a series of events, right? So President Woodrow
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   Wilson has been president through this entire period of time. He has just run in the 1916
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:04.000]   presidential election on a campaign to keep the United States out of war. But then in early 1917,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.080]   the Germans, in some ways, sort of twist the Americans' arms, right? The Germans' sort of
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.160]   high command comes to understand that, you know, that they're stuck, right? That they, you know,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.800]   they're stuck in this trench warfare, they need a big breakthrough. Their one big chance is to
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.880]   sort of break the blockade, to push through that the British have imposed on them, to break through
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.560]   against France. And so they do. And along with this, they start sinking ships on the Atlantic,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.000]   including American ships. The Germans know full well, this will draw the United States into war.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.840]   But the Germans look at the United States at this moment, a relatively small army,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   a relatively small navy, a country that, at least on paper, is deeply divided about whether to join
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.080]   the war. And so they say, let's do it, right? They're not going to get any American soldiers
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:08.400]   there in time, right? You know, it was a gamble, but I think probably their best chance. They took
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.560]   that gamble, they lost, right? In part because French resistance was strong, in part because
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.960]   Americans mobilized much faster and in much greater numbers than the Germans thought they would.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   - So the American people were divided.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.400]   - The American people were absolutely divided about whether to enter this war,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.360]   right? From 1914 to 1917, there is a searing debate across the political spectrum. It doesn't
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.520]   break down easily on party lines about whether it was in the US interest to do this, whether American
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.960]   troops should be sent abroad, whether, you know, Americans would end up just being cannon fodder
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:53.920]   for the European empires. Eventually, as American ships are sunk, first in the Lusitania in 1915,
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   then in much greater numbers in 1917, you know, the tide starts to turn and Americans feel that,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.880]   you know, our response is necessary. And the actual declaration of war in Congress is
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.920]   pretty lopsided, but it's not unanimous by any means.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.200]   - Lopsided towards entering the war.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:21.920]   - Well, that's really interesting because there's echoes of that in later wars where Congress seems
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.320]   to, nobody wants to be the guy that says no to war for some reason. Once you sense that,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:35.680]   in terms of, sorry, in terms of the politicians, because then you appear weak, but I wonder if
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.840]   that was always the case. So you make the case that World War I is largely responsible for
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:50.400]   defining what it means to be an American citizen. So in which way does it define the American
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.520]   citizen? - When you think about citizenship,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.400]   what it means is two things. First of all, what are your rights and obligations? What is sort of
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   the legal citizenship that you have as a citizen of the United States or any other state? And the
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.320]   second is a more amorphous definition of like, what does it mean to belong, right? To be part
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:16.560]   of America, right? To feel American, to, you know, to love it or hate it or be willing to die for it,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:23.360]   right? And both of those things really are crystal clear in terms of their importance during the war,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:30.240]   right? So both of those things are on the table. Being a citizen who is a citizen, who isn't,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.720]   matters. So people who had never carried passports or, you know, anything before suddenly have to,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:43.120]   but also what it means to be an American, right? To feel like it, to be part of this project is
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.960]   also kind of being defined and enforced during World War I. - So project, you know, is a funny
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:56.160]   way to put a global war, right? So can you tell the story, perhaps that's a good example of it,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:04.880]   of the James Montgomery Flagg's 1916 poster that reads, "I want you." A lot of people know this
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.640]   poster, I think, in its original form, in its memefied form, I don't know, but we know this
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.960]   poster and we don't know where it came from, or most Americans, I think, me included, didn't know
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   where it came from and it actually comes from 1916. Does this poster represent the birth of something
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:34.880]   new in America, which is a commodification or, I don't know, that propaganda machine that says
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.680]   what it means to be an American is somebody that fights for their country? - Yeah, so the image,
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.640]   it's in fact, I think, one of the most recognizable images, not only in the United States,
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.760]   but in the entire world, right? And you could bring it almost anywhere on earth in 2022 and
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.680]   people will know what it refers to, right? And so this is an image that circulated first as a
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:06.000]   magazine cover, later as a recruitment poster, where the figure is Uncle Sam, sort of pointing
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.280]   at the viewer with his finger, sort of pointing and saying, "I want you," right? And the "I want
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:18.720]   you" is a recruitment tool to join the U.S. Army. And this image, you know, really kind of starts
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.680]   as a kind of, like I said, a magazine cover in 1916 by the artist James Montgomery Flagg. It
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.040]   initially appears under the heading, "What are you doing for preparedness?" Meaning to prepare
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.240]   in case war comes to the United States. And at that point in 1916, we're still neutral.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:45.840]   In 1917, it's turned into a U.S. Army recruiting poster. And then it reappears in World War II,
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.520]   reappears generations after, you know, like you said, it's now, it gets remixed, memefied,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:59.040]   it's all over the place. I think for me, it's a turning point, it's a sort of window into
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.200]   American culture at a crucial moment in our history, where the federal government is now
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.600]   embarking on a war overseas that's going to make enormous demands on its citizens.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:17.680]   And at the same time, where sort of technologies of mass production and mass media, and what we
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.160]   would probably call propaganda, are being sort of mobilized for the first time in this new kind
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:32.880]   of way. - Well, in some sense, is it fair to say that the empire is born, the expanding empire is
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:40.240]   born from the Noam Chomsky perspective kind of empire that seeks to have military influence
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.720]   elsewhere in the world? - Yes, but I think as historians, we need to be at least as interested
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.160]   in what happens to the people who are getting pointed to by Uncle Sam, right? Rather than just
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.000]   the one, you know, whether he's pointing at us. And, you know, so yes, he's asking us to do that,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.120]   but how do we respond? - And the people responded. So the people are ultimately the
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:10.560]   machines of history, the mechanisms of history. It's not the Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam can only do
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.120]   so much if the people aren't willing to step up. - Absolutely. And, you know, the American people
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.600]   responded for sure, but they didn't build what Uncle Sam asked them to do in that poster, right?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   And I think that's, you know, kind of a crucial aspect that, you know, there never would have been
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.880]   sort of global US power without the response that begins in World War I. - What was the Selective
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.400]   Service Act of 1917? - So one of the very first things that Uncle Sam wants you to do, right,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.560]   is to register for selective service, for the draft, right? And the laws passed very soon after
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.840]   the US enters the war. It's sort of, you know, demanding that all men, first between 21 and 30,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   then between 18 and 45, register for the draft, and they'll be selected by a government agency,
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.200]   by a volunteer organization. - So it's a requirement to sign up? - It is a legal requirement
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.920]   to register. Of course, not everyone who registers is selected, but over the course of the war,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   24 million men register, almost 4 million serve in some fashion. - What was the response? What was
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.400]   the feeling amongst the American people to have to sign up to the Selective Service Act?
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:27.920]   - Well... - Have to register? - Yeah, this is a bigger turning point than we might think,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.640]   right? In some ways, this is a tougher demand of the American public than entering the war. It's
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.000]   one thing to declare war on Germany, right? It's another thing to go down to your local post office
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.280]   and fill out the forms that allow your own government to send you there to fight. And this
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.400]   is especially important at a time when the federal government doesn't really have any other way to
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:56.800]   find you, unless you actually go and register yourself, right? And so, you know, ordinary
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   people are participating in the building of this war machine, but at least a half a million of them
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.200]   don't, right? And simply never fill out the forms, move from one town to another. - But you said 20
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.880]   million did? 20 something? - Yeah, about 24 million register, at least 500,000. - Is it
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.800]   surprising to you that that many registered since the country was divided? - It is, and that's what
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.400]   I, you know, sort of tried to dig in to figure out how did you get 24 million people to register for
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.920]   the draft, and it's certainly not coming from the top down, right? You know, there may be a hundred,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.160]   sort of, agents in what's now called the FBI. You know, it's certainly not being enforced from
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.840]   Washington. It's being enforced in, you know, through the eyes of everyday neighbors, you know,
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.320]   through community surveillance, all kinds of ways. - Oh, so there was like a pressure? - There's a lot
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:57.360]   of pressure. - Interesting. So there was not a significant, like, anti-war movement, as you would
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:04.800]   see maybe later with Vietnam and things like this? - There was a significant movement before 1917,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.720]   but it becomes very hard to keep up an organized anti-war movement after that, particularly when
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:17.920]   the government starts shutting down protests. - So as the Selective Service Act of 1917 runs up
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:26.480]   against some of the freedoms, some of the rights that are defined in our founding documents,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:33.840]   what was that clash like? What was sacrificed? What freedoms and rights were sacrificed in this
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.600]   process? - I mean, I think on some level the fundamental right, right, is liberty, right?
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:48.720]   That conscription sort of demands, you know, sacrifice on the behalf of some for notionally
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.520]   for the protection of all. - So even if you're against the war, you're forced to fight? - Right,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.320]   yes. You know, and there were small provisions for conscientious objectors, solely those who
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.640]   had religious objections to all war, right, not political objections to this war. And some, you
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.800]   know, several thousand were able to take those provisions, but even then they faced social
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   sanction, they faced ridicule, some of them faced intimidation, you know. So those liberty interests,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   both individual freedom, religious freedom, you know, those are some of the first things to go.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:32.800]   - So what about freedom of speech? Was there silencing of the press, of the voices of the
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.520]   different people that were object? - Yes, absolutely, right. And so very soon after the
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.880]   Selective Service Act is passed, then you get the Espionage Act, which of course is back in the news
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.240]   in 2022. - What's the Espionage Act? - The Espionage Act is a sort of omnibus bill. It contains about
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.600]   10 or different provisions, very few of which have to do with espionage, but one key provision
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.520]   basically makes it illegal to say or do anything that would interfere with military recruitment,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:07.360]   right. And that provision is used to shut down radical publications, to shut down German language
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.720]   publications, and you know, this really has a chilling impact on speech during the war.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   - Could you put into words what it means to be an American citizen that is in part sparked by
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:28.800]   World War I? What does that mean? Somebody that should be willing to sacrifice
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:38.560]   certain freedoms to fight for their country, somebody that's willing to fight to spread
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:45.760]   freedom elsewhere in the world, spread the American ideals, like what, does that begin to
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.840]   tell the story what it means to be an American? - I think what we see is a change, right. So
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:30:01.280]   citizenship during World War I now includes the obligation to defend the country, right, to serve,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.520]   and to, if asked, to die for it, right. And we certainly see that, and I think we see
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.760]   the close linkage of military service and US citizenship coming out of this time period.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.840]   But you know, when you start making lots of demands on people to fulfill obligations,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.040]   in turn, they're going to start demanding rights. And we start to see, not necessarily during the
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.440]   war, but after, more demands for free speech protections, more demands for equality for
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.360]   marginalized groups. And so, you know, obligations and rights are sort of developing in a dynamic
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:45.680]   relationship. - Oh, it's almost like an overreach of power sparked a sense like, oh, crap, we can't
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:53.200]   trust centralized power to drag us into a war. We need to be able to, so there's the birth of that
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.080]   tension between the government and the people. - It's a rebirth of it, you know, of course,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.600]   that tension is always there, but in its modern form, I think it comes from this. - Reintensification
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.720]   of it. So what about, you said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state in the US.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:16.560]   Can you explain? - Yeah, so the Espionage Act, you know, sort of empowers federal organizations
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:23.120]   to watch other Americans. They are particularly interested in anyone who is obstructing the draft,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:31.680]   anyone who is trying to kind of organize labor or strikes or radical movements, and anyone who
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.800]   might have sympathy for Germany, which basically means, you know, all German Americans come under
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.920]   surveillance. Initially, you know, this is very small scale, but soon every government agency
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.360]   gets involved, from the Treasury Department's Secret Service to the Post Office, which is
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:55.760]   sort of reading mail, to the Justice Department, which mobilizes 200,000 volunteers. You know,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.440]   it's a really significant enterprise. Much of it goes away after the war, but of all the things
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.680]   that go away, this core of the surveillance state is the thing that persists most fully.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:14.800]   - Is this also a place where government, the size of government starts to grow
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.360]   in these different organizations, or maybe creates a momentum for growth of government?
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.520]   - Oh, it's exponential growth, right? That, you know, that over the course of the war,
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.880]   by almost any metric you use, right, the size of the federal budget, the number of federal
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.360]   employees, the number of soldiers in the standing army, all of those things skyrocket during the
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.160]   war. They go down after the war, but they never go down to what they were before.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.560]   - And probably gave a momentum for growth over time.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.600]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:53.120]   - Did World War I give birth to the military-industrial complex in the United States? So,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:33:04.240]   war profiteering, expanding of the war machine in order to financially benefit a lot of parties
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   involved. - So, I guess I would maybe break that into two parts, right? That, on the one hand,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.800]   yes, there is war profiteering, there are investigations of it in the years after the war,
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:27.280]   there's a widespread concern that the profit motive had played, you know, too much of a part
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.040]   in the war, and that's definitely the case. But I think when you try to think of this term
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.360]   military-industrial complex, it's best, you know, to think of it as, you know, at what point does
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.280]   the one side lock in the other, right? That military choices are shaped by industry, you know,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:52.240]   objectives and vice versa. And I don't think that that was fully locked into place during World War
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.360]   I. I think that's really a Cold War phenomenon when the United States is on this intense kind
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.240]   of footing for two generations in a row. - So, industrial is really important there,
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:10.080]   there is companies. So, before then, weapons of war were created, were funded directly by
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:17.200]   the government. Like, who was manufacturing the weapons of war? - They were generally manufactured
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:24.080]   by private industry. There were, of course, arsenals, sort of 19th century iterations where
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.040]   the government would produce its own weapons, partly to make sure that they got what they
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.440]   wanted. But most of the weapons of war for all of the European powers, and the United States,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.600]   are produced by private industry. - So, why do you say that the military-industrial complex
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:47.120]   didn't start then? What was the important thing that happened in the Cold War? - I think one way
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.920]   to think about it is the Cold War is a point at which it switches from being a dial to a ratchet,
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:01.200]   right? So, during World War I, the relationship between the military and industry dials up fast
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:09.040]   and high and stays that way, and it dials back down. Whereas during the Cold War, sort of the
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.600]   relationship between the two often looks more like a ratchet. - Yeah, so it becomes unstoppable.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.280]   - It goes up again. - In the way that you start, I think
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:27.760]   the way the military-industrial complex is often discussed is as a system that is unstoppable.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.120]   - Right. - Like it expands. It almost, I mean,
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:43.440]   if you take a very cynical view, it creates war so that it can make money. It doesn't just find
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.360]   places where it can help through military conflict. It creates tensions that directly
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.880]   or indirectly lead to military conflict that it can then fuel and make money from.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:03.440]   - That is certainly one of the concerns of both people who are critical of the First World War
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.120]   and then also of Dwight Eisenhower, right, when he's president and sort of in his farewell address
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.760]   where he sort of introduces the term military-industrial complex. And some of it is about
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.640]   the profit motive, but some of it is a fear that Eisenhower had that no one had an interest in
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.680]   stopping this, right, and that no one had a voice in stopping it, and that the ordinary American
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:32.480]   could really do nothing to sort of, you know, to kind of, to dial things down.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:39.840]   - Is it strange to you that we don't often hear that kind of speech today with like Eisenhower
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.680]   speaking about the military-industrial complex? So for example, we'll have people criticizing
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:54.160]   the spending on war efforts, but they're not discussing the, yeah, the machinery of the
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:01.520]   military-industrial complex, like the basic way that human nature works, the way that we get
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.440]   ourselves trapped in this thing. They're saying like, there's better things to spend money on
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:14.320]   versus describing a very seemingly natural process of when you build weapons of war
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.120]   that's gonna lead to more war. Like it pulls you in somehow.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:27.840]   - Yeah, I would say throughout the Cold War and even after the end of it, there has not been a
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:36.880]   sustained conversation in the United States about our defense establishment, right, what we really
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   need and what serves our interest, and to what extent sort of other things like market forces,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.440]   profit motives, you know, belong in that conversation. What's interesting is that
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.800]   in the generation after the First World War, that conversation was on the table, right,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.880]   through a series of investigations in the US, the Nye Committee in Britain, a Royal Commission,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.480]   journalistic exposés. You know, this would have been just talked about constantly in the years
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.400]   between about 1930 and 1936 as people were starting to worry, right, that storm clouds
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.440]   were gathering in Europe again. - Yeah, but it always seems like
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:32.160]   those folks get pushed to the fringes. You're made an activist versus a thinking leader.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:39.840]   - Those discussions are often marginalized, framed as conspiracy theory, et cetera, and, you know,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.920]   I think it's important to realize that, you know, in the generation after World War I,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   this was a serious civic conversation. It led to, you know, sort of investigations of defense,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.800]   sort of finance. It led to experiments in Britain and France in public finance of war material,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:05.120]   and I think those conversations need to be reconvened now in the 21st century.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.640]   - Is there any parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine? The reason I bring it up is
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:24.080]   because you mentioned sort of there was a hunger for war, a capacity for war that was already
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:32.560]   established, and the different parties were just boiling the tensions. So there's a case made that
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:39.120]   America had a role to play, NATO had a role to play in the current war in Ukraine. Is there some
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.720]   truth to that when you think about it in the context of World War I,
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:51.120]   or is it purely about the specific parties involved, which is Russia and Ukraine?
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:59.680]   - I think it's very easy to draw parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.560]   but I don't think they really work. The First World War in some ways is generated by
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:20.480]   a fundamental conflict in the European system of empires, right, in the global system of empires.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:27.040]   So in many ways, if there's a parallel, the war in Ukraine is the parallel to some of the conflicts
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:41.040]   in the Mediterranean and the Balkans in 1911 to 1913, that then later there was a much greater
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:48.400]   conflict, right? And so I think if there's any lessons to be learned for how not to let World
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:55.920]   War III look like World War I, it would be to make sure that systems aren't locked into place,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:02.400]   that escalate wars out of people's expectations. - That's, I suppose, what I was implying,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   that this is the early stages of World War III, that in the same way that
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.400]   several wolves are licking their chops, or whatever the expression is,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.240]   they're creating tension, they're creating military conflict with a kind of unstoppable
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:29.920]   imperative for a global war. That's, I mean, many kind of people that are looking at this
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:38.640]   are really worried about that. Now, the forcing function to stop this war is that there's several
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:46.560]   nuclear powers involved, which has, at least for now, worked to stop full-on global war,
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.600]   but I'm not sure that's going to be the case. In fact, what is one of the
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:59.760]   surprising things to me in Ukraine is that still in the 21st century, we can go to something that
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:07.040]   involves nuclear powers, not directly yet, but awfully close to directly, go to a hot war.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:16.240]   And so do you worry about that, that there's a kind of descent into a World War I type of scenario?
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.960]   >> Yes. I mean, that keeps me up at night, and I think it should keep the citizens of both
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:32.000]   the United States and Russia up at night. And I think, again, it gets back to what I was saying,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:40.960]   in the summer of 1914, even then, things that looked like a march toward war
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:49.360]   could have been different, right? And so I think it's important for leaders of both countries and
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.320]   of all of the sort of related countries, of Ukraine, of the various NATO powers, to really
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:02.240]   sort of imagine off-ramps and to imagine alternatives and to make them possible,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:09.120]   whether it's through diplomacy, whether it's through other formats. I think that
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.560]   that's the only way to prevent sort of greater escalation.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.080]   >> What's the difference between World War I and the Civil War, in terms of how they defined what
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.320]   it means to be an American, but also the American citizen's relationship with the war,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:32.160]   what the leaders were doing? Is there interesting differences and similarities?
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.320]   Besides the fact that everybody seems to have forgot about World War I in the United States,
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:46.880]   and everyone still remembers Civil War. >> I mean, it's true. And the American Civil War
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:52.640]   defines American identity in some ways, along with the Revolution and the Second World War,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:44:00.480]   more so than any other conflict. And it's a fundamentally different war, right? It's one
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.120]   because it is a civil war, right? Because of secession, because of the Confederacy,
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:14.480]   this is a conflict happening on the territory of the United States between Americans. And so
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:21.280]   the dynamics are really quite different, right? So the leaders, particularly Lincoln, have a
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.480]   different relationship to the home front, to civilians, than say, Wilson or Roosevelt have
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:34.320]   in World War I and II. >> Also, the way you would tell the story of the Civil War, perhaps similar
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.160]   to the way we tell the story of World War II, there's a reason to actually fight the war. The
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.360]   way we tell the story is we're fighting for this ideal that all men are created equal, that the
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:54.960]   war is over slavery, in part. Perhaps that's a drastic oversimplification of what the war was
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:02.640]   actually about in the moment, like how do you get pulled into an actual war versus a hot discussion.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:10.320]   And the same with World War II, people kind of framed the narrative that it was against evil,
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:18.960]   Hitler being evil. I think the key part of that is probably the Holocaust, that's how you can
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.920]   formulate Hitler as being evil. If there's no Holocaust, perhaps there's a case to be made that
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:32.400]   we wouldn't see World War II as such a quote-unquote good war, that there's an atrocity that
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:38.720]   had to happen to make it really, to be able to tell a clear narrative of why we get into this war.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.480]   Perhaps such a narrative doesn't exist for World War I, and so that doesn't stay in the American
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:50.000]   mind. We try to sweep it under the rug, given though overall 16 million people died.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:58.720]   So to you, the difference is in the fact that you're fighting for ideas and fighting
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.600]   on the homeland, but in terms of people's participation,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:09.840]   you know, fighting for your country, was there similarities there?
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:18.160]   Yeah, I mean I think, I mean the Civil War in both the North and the South, troops are raised
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   overwhelmingly through volunteer recruitment. There is a draft in both the North and the South,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:33.360]   but you know, it's not significant. Only 8% of Confederate soldiers came in through conscription.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:43.520]   And so in fact, you know, the mobilization for volunteers, often organized locally around
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   individual communities or states, creates sort of multiple identities and levels of loyalty,
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.000]   where people both in the North and the South have loyalty both to their state regiments,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.960]   to their sort of community militias, and as well to the country. They are fighting over the country,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.280]   right, over the United States, and so the Union and the Confederacy have conflicting and ultimately
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:15.920]   irreconcilable visions of that. But you know, that sort of nationalism that comes out of the Union
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.440]   after the victory in the war is a kind of crucial force shaping America ever since.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.080]   So what was the neutrality period? Why did the U.S. stay out of the war for so long? Like what
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:35.920]   was going on in that interesting, like what made Woodrow Wilson change his mind? What was the
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:43.840]   interesting dynamic there? I always say that the United States entered the war in April of 1917,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   but Americans entered it right away, right? They entered it, you know, some of them actually went
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:58.400]   and volunteered and fought almost exclusively on the side of Britain and France. At least 50,000
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:05.280]   joined the Canadian Army or the British Army and served. Millions volunteer, they sent humanitarian
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:11.520]   aid. I think in many ways modern war creates modern humanitarianism, and we can see that
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:17.200]   in the neutrality period. And even if they wanted the United States to stay out of the war,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.480]   a lot of Americans get involved in it by thinking about it, caring about it, you know, arguing about
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:29.280]   it. And you know, at the same time, they're worried that British propaganda is shaping their
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:36.240]   news system. They are worried that German espionage is undermining them. They're worried
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.640]   that both Britain and Germany are trying to interfere in American elections and American
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:47.360]   news cycles. You know, and at the same time, a revolution is breaking out in Mexico, right? So
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:51.440]   there are sort of, you know, concerns about what's happening in the Western Hemisphere as well as
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.040]   what's happening in Europe. So World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars,
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:08.560]   and it didn't. How did World War I pave the way to World War II? Every nation probably has their
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:15.360]   own story in this trajectory towards World War II. How did Europe allow World War II to happen?
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:22.320]   How did the Soviet Union, Russia allow World War II to happen? And how did America allow World War
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.440]   II to happen? And Japan. Yeah, you're right. The answer is different for each country, right?
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:34.960]   That in some ways, in Germany, the culture of defeat, the experience of defeat at the end of
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:42.800]   World War I leads to a culture of resentment, recrimination, finger-pointing, blame that
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:50.720]   makes German politics very ugly. As one person puts it, brutalizes German politics.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:56.240]   It places resentment at the core of the populace and its politics.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:02.160]   Yeah. And, you know, so in some ways that lays the groundwork for the kind of politics of resentment
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:08.960]   and hate that comes from the Nazis. You know, for the United States, in some ways the failure to win
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   the peace, you know, sets up the possibility for the next war, right? That the United States,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.280]   you know, through Wilson is sort of crafting a new international order in order that this will be the
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.240]   war to end all wars. But because the United States failed to join the League of Nations,
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:35.040]   you see the United States really sort of on the hook for another generation. In Asia, the story
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.320]   is more complicated, right? And I think it's worth bearing that in mind that World War II is a two
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:47.680]   front war. It starts in Asia for its own reasons. World War I is transformative for Japan, right?
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:54.560]   It is a time of massive economic expansion. A lot of that sort of economic wealth is poured
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.080]   into sort of greater industrialization and militarization. And so when the military wing
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:07.200]   in Japanese politics takes over in the 1930s, they're in some ways flexing muscles that come
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.880]   out of the First World War. Can you talk about the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles?
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.880]   What's interesting about that dynamics there? Of the parties involved, of
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.520]   how it could have been done differently to avoid the resentment? Is there, or again, is it
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   inevitable? So the war ends and very soon, even before the war is over, the United States in
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.360]   particular is trying to shape the peace, right? And the United States is the central actor at the
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:49.840]   Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Woodrow Wilson is there, he's presiding, and he knows that he
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:58.240]   calls the shots. So he was respected. He was respected, but resentfully in some ways by the
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.000]   European powers, Britain and France and Italy to a lesser extent, who felt that they had sacrificed
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.120]   to more. They had two goals, right? They wanted to shape the imperial system in order to make sure
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:16.480]   that their fundamental economic structures wouldn't change. And they also wanted to
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:22.240]   weaken Germany as much as possible, right? So that Germany couldn't rise again.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   What this leads to is a peace treaty that maintains some of the fundamental conflicts of the
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:38.160]   imperial system and makes, bankrupts Germany, starves Germany and feeds this politics of
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:44.880]   resentment that make it impossible for Germany to kind of participate in a European order.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:51.360]   So people like historian Neil Ferguson, for example, make the case that
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:58.160]   if Britain stayed out of World War I, we would have avoided this whole mess and we would
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.440]   potentially even avoid World War II. There's kind of counterfactual history.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:11.360]   Do you think it's possible to make the case for that? That there was a moment, especially in that
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:17.120]   case, staying out of the war for Britain, that the escalation to a global war could have been avoided
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.680]   and one that ultimately ends in a deep global resentment. So where Germany is resentful, not
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:29.920]   just of France or particular nations, but is resentful of the entire, I don't know how you
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:37.520]   define it, the West or something like this, the entire global world? I wish it were that easy.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:50.320]   And, you know, I think it's useful to think in counterfactuals, you know, what if. And if you
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:57.600]   believe, as historians do, in causation, then if that one thing causes another, then you also have
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.160]   to believe in counterfactuals, right? That if something hadn't happened, then maybe that wouldn't,
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:09.680]   you know, that would have worked differently. But I think all the things that led to World War I
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:16.320]   are multi-causal and nuanced. And this is what historians do. We make things more complicated.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.640]   And so, you know, there was no one thing that could have, you know, that could have turned the
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:28.800]   tide of history, you know. And, you know, oh, if only Hitler had gotten into art school, or oh,
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:34.960]   if only Fidel Castro had gotten into the major leagues, you know. Those are interesting thought
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.040]   experiments, but few events in history, I think, are that contingent.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:46.400]   Well, Hitler is an example of somebody who's a charismatic leader that seems to have a really
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:56.880]   disproportionate amount of influence on the tide of history. So, you know, if you look at Stalin,
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.440]   you could imagine that many other people could have stepped into that role.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:09.920]   And the same goes for many of the other presidents through, or even Mao. It seems that there's a
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:16.480]   singular nature to Hitler, that you could play the counterfactual, that if there was no Hitler,
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:23.680]   you may have not had World War II. He, better than many leaders in history, was able to channel
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:29.760]   the resentment of the populace into a very aggressive expansion of the military, and
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:37.200]   I would say skillful deceit of the entire world in terms of his plans, and was able to
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:45.360]   effectively start the war. So, is it possible that, I mean, could Hitler have been stopped?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.280]   Could we have avoided if he just got into art school?
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:49.780]   Right.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:55.600]   Or again, do you feel like there's a current of events that was unstoppable?
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:01.120]   I mean, part of what you're talking about is Hitler the individual as a sort of charismatic
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:07.440]   leader who's able to mobilize, you know, the nation, and part of it is Hitlerism, right?
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:14.000]   His own sort of individual ability to play, for example, play off his subordinates against one
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.480]   another to set up a system of that nature that in some ways escalates violence, including,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.840]   you know, the violence that leads to the Holocaust. And some of it is also Hitlerism
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:33.600]   as a leader cult, and we see this in many other sort of things where a political movement
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   surrounds one particular individual who may or may not be replaceable. So, yes, the World War II we
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:48.400]   got would have been completely different if a different sort of faction had risen to power in
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:57.120]   Germany. But, you know, Depression-era Europe was so unstable, and democracies collapsed throughout
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:03.040]   Western Europe over the course of the 1930s, you know, whether they had charismatic totalitarian
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.760]   leaders or not.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:10.640]   Have you actually read one book I just recently finished? I'd love to get your opinion
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.240]   from a historian perspective. There's a book called Blitzed, Drugs in the Third Reich by
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:26.000]   Norman Oler. It makes the case that drugs played a very large, meth essentially, played a very large
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:34.640]   role in World War II. There's a lot of criticism of this book, saying that it's, kind of to what
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.920]   you're saying, it takes this one little variable and makes it like this explains everything.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.240]   So everything about Hitler, everything about the blitzkrieg, everything about the military,
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.360]   the way, the strategy, the decisions could be explained through drugs, or at least implies
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:58.000]   that kind of thing. And the interesting thing about this book, because Hitler and Nazi Germany
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.680]   is one of the most sort of written about periods of human history, and this was not, drugs were
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:10.720]   almost entirely not written about in this context. So here come along this semi historian, 'cause I
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:16.880]   don't think he's even a historian. He's a, a lot of his work is fiction. Hopefully I'm saying that
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:22.160]   correctly. So he tells a really, that's one of the criticisms. He tells a very compelling story
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:31.200]   that drugs were at the center of this period and also of the man of Hitler. What are your
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.520]   sort of feelings and thoughts about, if you've gotten a chance to read this book,
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.160]   but I'm sure there's books like it, that tell an interesting perspective, singular perspective
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.360]   on a war? - Yeah, I mean, I have read it,
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:51.040]   and I also had this sort of eye-opening experience that a lot of historians did, and they're like,
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:59:00.400]   why didn't we think about this? And I think whether he's, the author Oller is sort of not a
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.560]   trained academic historian, but the joy of history is like, you don't have to be one to write good
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:13.920]   history. And I don't think anyone sort of criticizes him for that. I like the book as a
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.200]   window into the Third Reich. Of course, drugs don't explain all of it, but it helps us see
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:32.640]   the people who supported Hitler, the ways in which it was that mind-altering and performance-altering
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.360]   drugs were used to kind of keep soldiers on the battlefield, the ways in which.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:45.680]   I think that we don't fully understand the extent to which the Third Reich is held together with
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:54.960]   like duct tape from a pretty early phase, by like 1940 or '41 even. It's all smoke and mirrors. And
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.760]   I think that wartime propaganda, both Germans trying to say, we're winning everything, and
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.880]   America trying to mobilize, and the other allies to mobilize against Germany, described a more
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.320]   formidable enemy than it really was by 1941 and '42.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.920]   - Yeah, I mean, I could see both cases. One is that duct tape doesn't make the man,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.320]   but also as an engineer, I'm a huge fan of duct tape.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.200]   - Yeah.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.360]   - 'Cause it does seem to solve a lot of problems. And I do worry that this perspective
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.120]   that the book presents about drugs is somehow to the mind really compelling,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:41.360]   because it's almost like the mind, or at least my mind searches for an answer.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.440]   How could this have happened? And it's nice to have a clean explanation. And drugs is one popular
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.640]   one when people talk about steroids in sports. The moment you introduce the topic of steroids,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.960]   somehow the mind wants to explain all success in the context was because this person was on
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:07.840]   steroids, Lance Armstrong. Well, it's a very sticky idea. Certain ideas, certain explanations
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.800]   are very sticky. And I think that's really dangerous because then you lose the full context.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.960]   And also in the case of drugs, it removes the responsibility from the person,
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:25.840]   both for the military genius and the evil. And I think it's a very dangerous thing to do.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.120]   Something about the mind, maybe it's just mind that's sticky to this. Well, drugs explain it.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.480]   If the drugs didn't happen, then it would be very different. It worries me
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.600]   how compelling it is of an explanation.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.560]   That's why it's maybe better to think of it as a window into the third, right?
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:44.800]   Yes.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.560]   Than an explanation of it.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.760]   But it's also a nice exploration of Hitler, the man. For some reason, discussing his habits,
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:59.440]   especially later in the war, his practices with drugs, gives you a window into the person. It
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   reminds you that this is a human being. Like a human being that gets emotional in the morning,
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.520]   gets thoughtful in the morning, hopeful, sad, depressed, angry, like a story of emotions of
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.640]   the human being. Somehow we construct, which is a pretty dangerous thing to do, we construct an
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.680]   evil monster out of Hitler when in reality, he's a human being like all of us. I think the lesson
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.280]   there is the Solzhenitsyn lesson, which is all of us, to some degree, are capable of evil.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:41.520]   Or maybe if you want to make it less powerful a statement, many of our leaders are capable of
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:49.360]   evil. That this Hitler is not truly singular in history. That, yeah, when the resentment of the
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.760]   populace matches the right charismatic leader, it's easy to make the kind of, not easy, but
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:02.320]   it's possible to frequently make the kind of initiation of military conflict that happened
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:09.680]   in World War II. By the way, because you said not a trained historian, one of the
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:17.920]   most compelling and, I don't know, entertaining and fascinating exploration of World War I comes
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:24.480]   from Dan Carlin. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to listen to his sort of podcast form
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.920]   telling of the blueprint for Armageddon, which is the telling of World War I. What do you think
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.520]   about Dan Carlin, you yourself as a historian who has studied, who has written about World War I?
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:44.000]   Do you enjoy that kind of telling of history? - Absolutely. And I think, again, you don't need
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.080]   a PhD in history to be a historian. - Does every historian agree with that?
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.280]   - No. - He gets quite a bit
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.560]   of criticism from historians. - I mean, we like to argue with each other
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.160]   and nitpick with each other, but the one thing I have no patience for is when we pull rank on each
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:09.680]   other. I think we depend on, if you're a historian in a university with degrees and research materials,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.960]   you depend on the work of people in some local community, like recording oral history,
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.120]   saving documents. And history is a social science, but it's also a storytelling art.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:28.480]   And history books are the ones you find on the shelves in bookstores that people read for fun,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:35.200]   and you can appreciate both the knowledge production as well as the storytelling.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:41.760]   And when you get a good oral storyteller like Dan Carlin, there's a reason that thousands and
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.560]   hundreds of thousands of people tune in. - Yeah, but he definitely suffers from anxiety
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.440]   about getting things correct, and it's very difficult. - Well, our first job is to get the
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:05:00.080]   facts correct, and then to tell the story off of those. - But the facts are so fuzzy. So, I mean,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:07.200]   you have probably my favorite telling of World War II is William Shire's Rise and Fall of the Third
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:16.960]   Reich, or at least not telling of Nazi Germany. And that goes to primary sources a lot, which is,
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:24.560]   like, I suppose that's the honest way to do it. But it's tough. It's really tough to write that
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:31.600]   way, to really go to primary sources always. And I think that one of the things that Dan tries to do,
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.600]   which is also really tough to do, perhaps easier in oral history,
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.000]   is try to make you feel what it was like to be there,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.880]   which I think he does by trying to tell the story of, like, individual soldiers.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.480]   Do you find that telling, like individual citizens? Do you find that kind of telling
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.080]   of history compelling? - Yeah, I mean, I think we need
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:09.280]   historical imagination. And I think historical imagination teaches something very valuable,
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:18.320]   which is humility, to realize that there are other people who've lived on this planet, and
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:26.400]   they organized their lives differently, and they made it through just fine too. And I think that
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:35.600]   that kind of meeting other people from the past can be actually a very useful skill for meeting
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.000]   people unlike you in the present. - Unlike you, but also like you. I think
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.520]   both are humbling. One, realizing that they did live in a different space and time, but two,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.760]   realizing that if you were placed in that space and time, you might have done all the same things,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:00.400]   whether it's the brave, good thing or the evil thing. - Yeah, absolutely. And you get also a
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:07.360]   sense of possibility. You know, there's this famous line, right, that those who do not learn
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:13.040]   history are condemned to repeat it. But I think the other half is true as well, which is those
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.600]   who do not learn history don't get the chance to repeat it, right? You know, that we're not
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.560]   the first people on this planet to face any certain kinds of problems. You know, other people
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.400]   have lived through worlds like this one before. - It's like when you fall in love as a teenager
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.120]   for the first time, and then there's a breakup. You think it's the greatest tragedy that has
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:42.320]   ever happened in the world. You're the first person. Even though like Romeo and Juliet and
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:49.040]   so on had this issue, you're the first person that truly feels the catastrophic heartbreak of
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:55.920]   that experience. It's good to be reminded that no, the human condition is what it is. We have
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:02.960]   lived through it at the individual and the societal scale. Let me ask you about nationalism,
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:10.480]   which I think is at the core of "I want you" poster. Is nationalism destructive or empowering
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.640]   to a nation? And we can use different words like patriotism, which is in many ways synonymous
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:25.040]   to nationalism, but in recent history, perhaps because of the Nazis, has slowly parted ways.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.160]   Somehow nationalism is when patriotism gone bad or something like this?
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:38.080]   Yeah, they're different, right? Patriotism is in some ways best thought of as an emotion,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:47.040]   right? And a feeling of love of country, right? Literally. And in some ways, that's a necessary
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:59.360]   condition to participate in nationalism. To me, I think nationalism is crucial in a world organized
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.560]   around nation states, and you have to sort of believe that you are engaged in a common project
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:14.160]   together, right? And so in the contemporary United States, in some ways that question is
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.200]   actually on the table in ways that it hasn't been in the past. But you have to believe that you're
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.240]   engaged in a common project, that you have something in common with the person with whom
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:31.040]   you share this nation, and that you would sacrifice for them, whether it's by paying taxes for them or
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.080]   going to war to defend them. That's a vision of what we might call civic nationalism.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.240]   That's the good version. The question is whether you can have that without having
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:52.480]   exclusionary nationalism, hating the other, right? Fearing the other, saying, "Yeah,
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:59.680]   you're part of this nation against all others." And I think there's a long tradition in America
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:09.440]   of a very inclusive nationalism that is open, inclusive, welcoming, and new people to this
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.520]   shared project. That's something to be defended. Exclusionary nationalism is based on
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.440]   ethnic hatreds and others that we see throughout the world,
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.400]   and those are things to be afraid of. But there is a kind of narrative in the United States that
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.680]   a nationalism that includes the big umbrella of democratic nations,
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:40.320]   nations that strive for freedom, and everybody else is against freedom and against human nature,
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:47.040]   and it just so happens that it's half and half split across the world. So that's imperialism
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:54.000]   that feels like it beats the drum of war. - Yeah, and I mean, I don't want to paint too
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.480]   rosy a picture, and certainly the United States as a nation has often found it easier to define
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:09.600]   ourselves against something than to clarify exactly what we're for. - Yeah, yeah. The Cold War,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:17.360]   China today. That's not only the United States, I suppose that's human nature.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.400]   We need a competitor. It's almost like maybe the success of human civilization requires
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:31.920]   figuring out how to construct competitors that don't result in global war.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:40.880]   - Yes, or figuring out how to turn enemies into rivals and competitors. There's a real difference.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.400]   You compete with competitors, you fight with enemies.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.560]   - Yeah, with competitors is a respect, maybe even a love underlying the competition.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:59.360]   What lessons, what are the biggest lessons you take away from World War I?
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   Maybe we talked about several, but you look back at the 20th century, what,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.000]   as a historian, what do you learn about human nature, about human civilization,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:28.240]   about history from looking at this war? - I think the lesson I would want everyone to take
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:36.000]   from the story of the First World War is that human life is not cheap.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:45.680]   All of the warring powers thought that just by throwing more men and more material at the front,
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:54.080]   they would solve their political problems with military force. At the end of the day in 1918,
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.800]   one side did win that, but it didn't actually solve any of those political problems.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.280]   - And in the end, the regular people paid the price with their lives.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:12.800]   - They did, and people who had been told that their lives were cheap remembered that.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.280]   And it sort of reshapes mass politics for the rest of the 20th century,
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.920]   both in Europe and around the world. - Yeah, the cost of a death of a single soldier
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:32.480]   is not just, or a single civilian, is not just the cost of that single life, it's the resentment,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:39.280]   that the anger, the hate that reverberates throughout. One of the things I saw in Ukraine
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:47.440]   is the birth of, at scale, of generational hate, not towards administrations or leaders,
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:54.240]   but towards entire peoples. And that hate, I mean, overnight that hate is created,
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.440]   and it takes perhaps decades for that hate to dissipate.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:05.120]   - It takes decades, and it takes collective effort to build institutions that divert that hate
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:12.640]   into other places. - One of the biggest things I thought was
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:21.440]   not part of the calculus in when the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq is the creation of
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:30.720]   hate. When you drop a bomb, even if it hits military targets, even if it kills soldiers,
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:39.040]   which in that case it didn't, there's a very large amount of civilians, what does that do to the,
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:48.000]   yeah, like, how many years, minutes, hours, months, and years of hate do you create with a single
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.520]   bomb you drop? And I calculate that, like, literally, in the Pentagon, have a chart,
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.520]   how many people will hate us, how many people does it take, do some science here, how many people
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.720]   does it take, when you have a million people that hate you, how many of them will become terrorists?
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:14.080]   How many of them will do something to the nation you love and care about, which is the United
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.800]   States, will do something that will be very costly? I feel like there was not a plot in a chart.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:28.160]   It was more about short-term effects. - Yes, again, it's the idea of using
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.240]   military force to solve political problems, and I think there's a squandering of goodwill that
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.560]   people have around the world toward the United States. You know, that's a respect for its economy,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.000]   for its consumer products, and so forth, and I think that's been lost, a lot of that.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.200]   - Do you think leaders can stop war? I have, perhaps, a romantic notion, perhaps,
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.840]   'cause I do these podcasts in person and so on, that leaders that get in a room together and can
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:04.160]   talk, they can stop war. I mean, that's the power of a leader, especially one in an authoritarian
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:14.960]   regime, that they can, through camaraderie, alleviate some of the emotions associated with the ego.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:24.080]   - Yes, leaders can stop war if they get into the room when they understand from
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.000]   the masses in their countries that war is something that they want stopped.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.240]   - So the people ultimately have a really big say.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.960]   - They do. You know, that it was mass movements by people in the United States for the nuclear
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:48.160]   freeze, in Russia pushing for openness that brought, for example, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:55.040]   Gorbachev to Reykjavik to sort of debate, you know, and eventually sort of put caps on nuclear weapons.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.160]   You know, those two people made choices in the room that made that possible,
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.800]   but they were both being pushed and knew they were being pushed by their people.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:13.520]   - Boy, that's a tough one. It puts a lot of responsibility on the German people, for example.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:23.200]   In both wars, we fans of history tend to conceive of history as a meeting of leaders. We think of
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.760]   Chamberlain, we think of Churchill and the importance of them in the Second World War.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.840]   I think about Hitler and Stalin and think that if certain conversations happened,
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:37.120]   they could have, the war could have been avoided. You tell the story of how many times Hitler
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:44.080]   and Nazi Germany's military might was not sufficient, they could have been easily stopped.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:52.480]   And the pacifists, the people who believed Hitler, were foolish enough to believe Hitler,
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.640]   didn't act properly. And if the leaders just woke up to that idea,
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:04.320]   - Yeah. And in fact, Churchill is a kind of representation of that, but in your conception
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.000]   here, it's possible that Churchill was also a representation of the British people,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.720]   even though seemingly unpopular, that force was,
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:19.600]   they gave birth to somebody like Churchill, who said, "We'll never surrender," right?
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.680]   - Yes. - "We shall fight in the beaches."
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:30.880]   - Yes. And I think World War II Britain is a good example of that. It is clearly a dynamic leader
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:39.280]   who has his pulse on what the people want and demand and are willing to do. And it's a dynamic
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:46.080]   art of leading that and shaping those wants at the same time as knowing that you're bound by them.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.920]   - Well, then if we conceive of history in this way, let me ask you about our presidents.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:57.840]   You are taking on the impossibly difficult task of teaching a course
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:04.880]   in a couple of years here, or in one year, called the History of American Presidential Elections.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.480]   So if the people are in part responsible for leaders,
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.800]   how can we explain what is going on in America that we have the leaders that we do today?
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.720]   So if we think about the elections of the past several cycles,
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:32.080]   I guess let me ask, are we a divided nation? Are we more of a divided nation than we were in the
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.680]   past? What do you understand about the American citizen at the beginning of this century
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:46.480]   from the leaders we have elected? - Yes, obviously we are a divided country in our rhetoric,
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:20:00.320]   in our day-to-day politics, but we are nowhere near as divided as we have been in other periods
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.480]   in our history, right? The most obvious, of course, being the American Civil War, right? 150 years ago.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.960]   And the distinction is not just that we haven't come to blows, but that we are fundamentally one
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:27.680]   society, one economy, and deeply integrated as a nation, both domestically and on the world stage,
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:37.600]   in ways that look nothing like the United States in 1861. Will political rhetoric
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.400]   continue to be extreme? Of course. But we're not as divided as people think we are.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:55.200]   - Well, then if you actually look throughout human history, does it always get so outside
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.920]   the people? Do the elections get as contentious as they've recently been?
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:06.880]   So there's a kind of perception that's been very close, and there's a lot of accusations,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.200]   a lot of tensions, it's very heated, it's almost fueling the machine of division.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:17.600]   Has that often been the case? - It has. We are... It has and it hasn't. I mean,
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:23.840]   I do think right now is different. And there it's worth distinguishing, you know, are there deep
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.520]   social or economic divisions, which I don't actually think that there are, versus partisanship
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.960]   in particular, sort of the rivalry between the two parties. And it's very clear that we are in
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:40.160]   an era of what political scientists call hyper-partisanship, right? And that the two
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:48.000]   parties have taken sort of fundamentally different positions and moved further apart from one another.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.880]   And that is what I think people talk about when they say our country is divided. So the country
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:03.520]   may not be divided, even if our politics are highly partisan. That is a divergence from other
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:11.040]   time periods in our history. - So I wonder if this kind of political partisanship is actually
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:21.280]   an illusion of division. I sometimes feel like we mostly all agree on some basic fundamentals.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:29.360]   And the things that people allegedly disagree on are really blown out of proportion. And there's
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.120]   like a media machine and the politicians really want you to pick a blue side and a red side. And
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.600]   because of that, somehow, I mean, families break up over Thanksgiving dinner about who they voted
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:48.560]   for. There's a really strong pressure to be the red or blue. And I wonder if that's a feature or
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:55.360]   a bug, whether this is just part of the mechanism of democracy that we want to, even if there's not
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.840]   a real thing to be divided over, we need to construct it such that you can always have a
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:07.120]   tension of ideas in order to make progress, to figure out how to progress as a nation.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:14.320]   - I think we're figuring that out in real time. On the one hand, it's easy to say that it's a feature
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:22.240]   of a political system that has two parties. And the United States is in some ways unique
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.280]   in not being a parliamentary democracy. And so in some ways, you would think that would be the
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:37.840]   feature that is causing partisanship and to reach these heights. That said, we can even see in
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:46.640]   parliamentary systems and all around the world that the same kinds of rhetorics of irreconcilable
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:53.600]   division, a kind of politics of emotion are proliferating around the world. Some of that,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:03.360]   as you say, I think is not as real as it appears on television, on social media and other formats.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:09.680]   So I don't know that other countries that are experiencing sort of political conflict,
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:18.720]   I'm not sure that they're deeply divided either. - So I've had the fortune of being intellectually
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:26.000]   active through the George Bush versus Al Gore election, then the Obama, and it's just every
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.360]   election since, right? And it seems like a large percentage of those elections,
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   there's been a claim that the elections were rigged, that there is some conspiracy, corruption,
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:46.960]   malevolence on the other side. I distinctly remember when Donald Trump won in 2016,
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   a lot of people I know said that election was rigged and there's different explanations,
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:25:02.000]   including Russian influence. And then in 2020, I was just running in Austin along the river,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.560]   and somebody said like, "Oh, huge fan of the podcast." And they said like, "What do you think
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.760]   of this? It's just not right what's happening in this country." That the 2020 election was
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:22.960]   obviously rigged from their perspective in electing Joe Biden versus Donald Trump.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.840]   Do you think there's a case to be made for and against each claim in the full context of history
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:39.120]   of our elections being rigged? - I think the American election system is fundamentally
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:54.880]   sound and reliable. And I think that the evidence is clear for that, regardless of which election
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.920]   you're looking at. In some ways, whether you look at a presidential election or even a local
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:09.920]   county election for dog catcher or something, right? That the amount of time and resources
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:16.960]   and precision that go into voter registration, vote counting, certification processes
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:25.280]   are crucial to democratic institutions. I think when someone says "rigged,"
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.560]   regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're coming from,
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:41.120]   they're looking for an answer. They're looking for that one answer for what is in fact a complex
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:50.080]   system, right? So on the left, when they say "rigged," they may be pointing to a wide range
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:59.040]   of ways in which they think that the system is tilted through gerrymandering,
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.560]   sort of misrepresentation through the electoral college. On the right, when people say "rigged,"
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:16.960]   they may be concerned about voter security, about ways in which the media, mainstream media,
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:28.400]   may control messages. And in both cases, the feeling is it's articulated as "my vote didn't
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:36.640]   get counted right." But the deeper concern is "my vote doesn't count." You know, "my voice
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:43.200]   isn't being heard." So no, I don't think the elections are rigged.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.240]   So let me sort of push back, right? There's a comfort to the story that they're not rigged.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:55.920]   And a lot of us like to live in comfort. So people who articulate conspiracy theories say,
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.440]   "Sure, it's nice to be comfortable, but here's the reality." And the thing they articulate is
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:07.120]   there's incentives in close elections, which we seem to have nonstop close elections. There's so
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:14.080]   many financial interests. There's so many powerful people. Surely you can construct, not just with
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.880]   the media and all the ways you described both on the left and the right, that elections could be
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:29.040]   rigged, but literally, actually in a fully illegal way, manipulate the results of votes.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:38.560]   Surely there's incentive to do that. And I don't think that's a totally ridiculous argument.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:44.480]   Because it's like, all right, well, I mean, it actually lands to the question,
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.920]   which is a hard question for me to ask, because ultimately as an optimist of how many
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:57.520]   malevolent people out there and how many malevolent people are required to rig an election.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:06.000]   So how many, what is the phase transition for a system to become from like a corruption light
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.320]   to corruption, to high level of corruption such that you could do things like rig elections,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:19.360]   which is what happens quite a lot in many nations in the world even today?
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.560]   So yes, there is interference in elections and there has been in American history, right? And
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:32.320]   we can go all the way back into the 18th century. You don't have to go back to Texas in the 1960s,
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:39.840]   LBJ, to find examples of direct interference in the outcome of elections. And there are
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:48.560]   incentives to do that. Those incentives will only feel more existential as hyper-partisanship
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:56.400]   makes people think that the outcome of the elections are a matter of black and white or
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:06.880]   life and death. And you will see people sort of organizing sort of every way they can to shape
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:12.960]   elections, right? We saw this in the 1850s, right? When settlers, pro and anti-slavery sort of
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:20.400]   flooded into Kansas to try to sort of determine the outcome of an election. And we see this in
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:27.040]   the reconstruction period, right? When the Ku Klux Klan shows up to kind of, to block the doors for
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:37.920]   black voters in the South. This history is not new, it's there. I think what the reason why I
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:44.080]   think that the system is sound is not, or the reason when I say I believe that the election
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:52.640]   system is fundamentally sound, it's not, I'm not trying to be reassuring or encourage complacency,
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.760]   right? I'm saying like, you know, this is something that we need to do and to work on.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:05.200]   So the current electoral mechanisms are sufficiently robust. Even if there is
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.920]   corruption, even if there is rigging, they're robust, like the force that corrects itself,
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:16.400]   self-corrects and ensures that nobody gets out of line is much stronger than the other incentives,
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:22.000]   which are like the corrupting incentives. And that's the thing I talked about corrupt,
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.320]   you know, visiting Ukraine, talking about corruption, where a lot of people talk about
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:35.200]   corruption as being a symptom, not if the system allows, creates the incentives for there to be
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.240]   corruption, humans will always go for corruption. That's just, you have to assume that. The power
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:45.600]   of the United States is that it constructs systems that prevent you from being corrupt at scale,
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.840]   at least, I mean, depends what you believe, but most of us, if you believe in this country,
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:58.000]   you have to, you believe in the self-correcting mechanisms of corruption, that even if that
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   desire is in the human heart, the system resists it, prevents it. That's your current belief.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:19.040]   Yes, as of today. But I do think that that will require oversight by institutions, ideally,
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.240]   ones that are insulated as much as possible from partisan politics, which is very difficult right
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:32.720]   now. And it will require the demands of the American people, that they want these elections
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:40.800]   to be fair and secure. And that means, you know, that means being willing to lose them,
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.040]   you know, regardless of which party you're in favor of. So what do you think about the power
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.720]   of the media to create partisanship? I'm really worried that there's a huge incentive, speaking
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:57.600]   of incentives, to divide the country. In the media and the politicians, I'm not sure where it
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:03.440]   originates, but it feels like it's the media. Maybe it's a very cynical perspective on journalism, but
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.640]   it seems like if we're angry and divided as evenly as possible, you're going to maximize
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.120]   the number of clicks. So it's almost like the media wants to elect people that are going to be
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:25.840]   the most divisive, maximizing. And the worry I have is they are not beyond either feeding,
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:32.080]   or if you want to be very cynical, manufacturing narratives that lead that division, like the
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:37.360]   narrative of an election being rigged. Because if you convinced half the populace that the election
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   was completely rigged, that's a really good way to get a lot of clicks. And like, the very cynical
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:53.840]   view is, I don't know if the media machine will stop the destruction of our democracy
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:03.360]   in service of getting more clicks. It may destroy our entire democracy just to get more clicks,
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:10.960]   just because the fire as the thing burns down will get clicks. Am I putting too much blame
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:16.240]   on the media here? The machine of it? You're diagnosing the incentive structure,
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:25.840]   or depicting that with 100% accuracy. But I think history teaches that you might be giving
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:34.800]   the media too much causal power. That the American people are smarter than the media
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:43.120]   that they consume. And even today, we know that. People who consume, even people who consume
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:52.400]   just Fox or just MSNBC know what they're consuming. And so I don't think that media will be
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:35:00.880]   the solution. And I certainly don't think that returning to a media structure of the mid-20th
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:08.080]   century with three news channels that all tell us one story, that's no golden age that we're
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:13.600]   trying to get back to, for sure. - Well, there is a novel thing in human
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:20.880]   history, which is Twitter and social media and so on. So we're trying to find our footing as a nation
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:30.080]   to figure out how to think about politics, how to maintain our basic freedoms, our sense of
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:38.960]   democracy, of our interaction with government and so on on this new media, or medium of social media.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:45.120]   Do you think Twitter, how do you think Twitter changed things? Do you think Twitter is good
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.880]   for democracy? Do you think it has changed what it means to be an American citizen?
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:57.840]   Or is it just the same old media mechanism? - It has not changed what it means to be an
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:10.000]   American citizen. It may have changed the day-to-day sound of being and the experience of
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:21.280]   it. It got noisier, it got louder, and it got more decentered. I think Twitter is paradoxical.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:28.720]   On the one hand, it is a fundamentally democratic platform, and in some ways it democratizes
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:36.560]   institutions that had gatekeepers and authority figures for a very long time. But on the other
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.480]   hand, it's not a democratic institution at all. It's a for-profit corporation, and it operates
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:50.640]   under those principles. And so that said, it's an institution of American and global life
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:37:00.000]   that the people of the United States have the authority to regulate or reshape as they see fit,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.600]   both that and other major media players. - So one of the most dramatic decisions
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:11.520]   that illustrate both sides of what you're saying is when Twitter decided to ban, I think permanently,
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:19.600]   the President of the United States, Donald Trump, off of Twitter. Can you make the case that that
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.800]   was a good idea and make the case that that was a bad idea? Can you see both perspectives on this?
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:31.840]   - Yes, I think, I mean, the simple fact of the matter is, you know, Twitter is a platform. It
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:38.720]   has rules of service. Twitter concluded that President Trump had violated the terms of service
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:46.640]   and blocked them, right? And if you have rules, you have to enforce them. Did it have, you know,
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:55.680]   did it have consequences? It had direct and predictable consequences, you know, that of
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:05.280]   creating a sense among millions of Americans that Twitter had taken a side in politics
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:12.960]   or confirming their belief that it had done so. Will it have unintended consequences? You know,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:18.160]   this is where the historian can come in and say, yes, there's always unintended consequences.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:25.440]   And we don't know, you know, sort of what it would mean for political figures to be excluded
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:36.400]   from various media platforms under these notions, right, that they had violated terms of service,
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:44.480]   et cetera. So, you know, so I guess we'll see. - Well, to me, so I'm generally against censorship,
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:51.920]   but to take Twitter's perspective, it's unclear to me in terms of unintended consequences
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:59.600]   whether censoring a human being from being part of your platform is going to
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:08.400]   decrease or increase the amount of hate in the world. So there's a strong case to be made that
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:15.680]   banning somebody like Donald Trump increases the amount of resentment among people, and that's a
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:21.600]   very large number of people that support him or even love him or even see him as a great president,
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.080]   one of the greatest this country has had. And so if you completely suppress his voice,
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:34.240]   you're going to intensify the support that he has from just the regular support for another
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:40.640]   human being who ran for president to somebody that becomes an almost heroic figure for that
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:48.880]   set of people. Now, the flip side is removing a person from a platform like Donald Trump
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:58.720]   might lessen the megaphone of that particular person, might actually level the democratic
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.960]   notion that everybody has a voice. So basically removing the loud extremes is helpful for giving
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:13.040]   the center, the calm, the thoughtful voices more power. And so in that sense, that teaches a lesson
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:22.000]   that don't be crazy in any one direction. Don't go full, don't go Lenin, don't go Hitler, don't,
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.680]   don't, like you have to stay in the middle. There's divisions in the middle, there's discussions in
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:34.560]   the middle, but stay in the middle. That's sort of the steel man, the case for censoring. But I,
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:44.720]   boy, is censorship a slippery slope. And also, boy, is Twitter becoming a thing that's more than
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:52.320]   just a company. It seems like it's a medium of communication that we use for information,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:41:01.440]   for knowledge, for wisdom even. During the period of COVID, we used it to gain an understanding of
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.080]   what the hell's going on, what should we do, what's the state of the art science. Science
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.040]   fundamentally transformed during the time of COVID because you have no time for the full review cycle
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.360]   that science usually goes through. And some of the best sources of information for me,
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.800]   from the conspiracy theory to the best doctors, was Twitter. The data, the stats, all that kind
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:29.520]   of stuff. And that feels like more than a company. And then Twitter and YouTube and different places
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:36.080]   took a really strong stance on COVID, which is the laziest stance in my opinion, which is we're
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:43.760]   gonna listen to whatever CDC or the institutions have said. But the reality is, you're an institution
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:52.960]   of your own now. You're kind of the press. You're like, there's a, it's a really difficult position.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:58.800]   It's a really, really difficult position to take. But I wish they have stepped up and take on the
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.200]   full responsibility and the pain of fighting for the freedom of speech.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:15.440]   Yes, they need to do that. But I'm struck by some of the things that you said, ways in which
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:24.400]   Twitter has the power to shape the conversation. And I don't think in a democratic society,
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:32.560]   democratic polities should cede that power to for-profit companies.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:38.800]   Do you agree that it's possible that Twitter has that power currently? Do you sense that it has
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:43.840]   the power? Because my sense is Twitter has the power to start wars, like tweets have the power
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:52.000]   to start wars, to change the direction of elections. Maybe in the sense in the ways in which
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:43:02.640]   a wave has the power to wash away sand. It's still the medium. It's not in itself an actor.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:08.240]   It's how actors use the platform, which requires us to scrutinize the structure of the platform
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.800]   and access to it. Unfortunately, it's not. Maybe it's similar to the wave. It's not just a medium.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:22.720]   It's a medium plus. It's a medium that enables virality, that benefits from virality of
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:33.120]   engagement. And that means singular voices can have a disproportionate impact. Like, not even
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:39.520]   voices, singular ideas, dramatic ideas can have a disproportionate impact. And so that actually
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.520]   threatens, it's almost like, I don't know what the equivalent is in nature, but it's a wave that can
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:54.000]   grow exponentially because of the intensity of the, the initial intensity of the wave. I don't
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:00.480]   know how to describe this, a dynamical system, but it feels like, it feels like there is a
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.080]   responsibility there not to accelerate voices just because they get a lot of engagement. You
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.040]   have to have a proportional representation of that voice. But you're saying that
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:19.760]   a strong democracy should be robust to that. A strong democracy can and should, and will be. I
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.680]   mean, I think the other thing a historian will tell you about Twitter is that this too shall
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:33.440]   pass, right? But I do think the structures of the platform, of the algorithm, of this and other major
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.560]   players are eligible for scrutiny by democratic institutions.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.960]   So, in preparing to teach the course, the history of American presidential elections,
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:53.440]   leading up to the 2024 elections, so one of the lessons of history is this too shall pass,
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:59.280]   so don't make everything about, this is going to either save or destroy our nation. That seems to
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:07.120]   be like the message of every single election as I'm doing Trump hands. Do you think Donald Trump,
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:13.760]   what do you think about the 2024 election? Do you think Donald Trump runs? Do you think the tension
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:24.560]   will grow? Or was that a singular moment? Do you think it'll be like AOC versus Trump or whoever,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:29.120]   whatever the most drama-maximizing thing, will things stabilize?
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:35.360]   I think I can, you know, historians don't like to predict the future, but I can predict this one,
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:42.160]   that it will not be a calm and stabilized election. I think as of the time that we're
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.160]   talking in 2022, we don't, there are too many sort of open questions, particularly about whether Joe
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:57.920]   Biden will run for re-election. He says he will, but the jury I think is out on that. I can't
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:08.800]   predict whether Donald Trump will run for election or not. I think we do know that President Trump
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   doesn't like to start things he can't win, and if the polling data suggests that he's not a
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:23.840]   credible candidate, he might be reluctant to enter the race and might find more appealing
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:30.160]   the kind of sideline, kind of kingmaker role that he's been crafting since he left the White House.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:37.120]   You know, I think there are plenty of people who are, you know, dreaming that there's some
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:44.480]   sort of centrist candidate, you know, whether it's a conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:51.440]   who will, you know, save us from all of this, either within the party or in a third-party run.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.520]   I don't think that's likely. Why aren't we getting them? Why don't you think it's likely?
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.280]   What's the explanation? There seems to be a general hunger for a person like this.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.880]   You would, but the system sorts it out, right? You know, that the primary systems and the party,
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:10.160]   you know, party candidate selection systems, you know, will favor sort of more, you know,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:16.000]   more partisan views, right? More conservative Republicans, more liberal Democrats as the kind
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:24.400]   of centric candidates. It seems like the system prefers mediocre executor, mediocre leaders,
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:31.440]   mediocre partisan leaders. If I take a cynical look, but maybe I'm romanticizing the leaders
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:36.880]   of the past, and maybe I'm just remembering the great leaders of the past. And yeah.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:40.320]   I can assure you there's plenty of mediocre partisans in the 19th century.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:49.840]   Okay. And the 20th. Well, let me ask you about platforming. Do you think,
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:55.600]   Donald, it's the Twitter question, but I was torn about whether to talk to Donald
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.200]   Trump on this podcast. As a historian, what would you advise?
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:08.960]   I think, I mean, you know, this is a difficult question, right? For historians who want,
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:16.160]   you know, sort of want to make sure that they know sort of what Americans are thinking and
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.160]   talking about, you know, four centuries later. So one of the things that, you know, at least my
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:28.960]   understanding is that when President Trump was banned from Twitter, his account was also deleted.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:37.280]   And that is one of the most valuable sources that historians will use to understand the era. And
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.960]   parts of it were sort of, you know, archived and reconstructed. But, you know, but in that sense,
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:50.080]   I think that that is also a real loss to the historical record. I mean, I think that your
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:58.720]   podcast shows you'll talk to anyone. I'm here, right? So, you know, I'm not in the business of
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.080]   saying, you know, don't talk to me. That's one of the difficult things when I think about Hitler.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:10.960]   I think Hitler, Stalin, I don't know if World War I quite has the same intensity of
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:19.760]   controversial leaders. But one of the sad things from a historian perspective is how few interviews
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:27.680]   Hitler has given or Stalin has given. And that's such a difficult thing because it's obvious that
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:35.760]   talking to Donald Trump, that talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Putin is really valuable from
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:42.400]   a historical perspective to understand. But then you think about the momentary impact of such a
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:51.040]   conversation and you think, well, depending on how the conversation goes, you could steer or flame,
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:50:00.400]   what is it, feed the flame of war or conflict or abuses of power and things like this.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.960]   And that's, I think, the tension between the journalist and the historian.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:12.160]   Because when journalists interview dictators, for example, one of the things that strikes me
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:23.600]   is they're often very critical of the dictator. They're basically attacking them in front of
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:29.360]   their face as opposed to trying to understand. Because what I perceive they're doing is they're
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.320]   signaling to the other journalists that they're on the right side of history kind of thing.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:40.160]   But that's not very productive. And it's also why the dictators and leaders often don't do
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.640]   those interviews. It's not productive to understand who the human being is. To understand,
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.040]   you have to empathize. Because few people, I think, few leaders do something
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.080]   from a place of malevolence. I think they really do think they're doing good.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.600]   And not even for themselves, not even for selfish reasons. I think they're doing great for the,
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:08.240]   they're doing the right thing for their country or for whoever the group they're leading. And
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.400]   to understand that, you have to, and by the way, a large percent of the country often supports them.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:22.160]   I bet if you legitimately poll people in North Korea, they will believe that their leader is
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:29.120]   doing the right thing for their country. And so to understand that, you have to empathize.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:32.880]   So that's the tension of the journalist, I think, and the historian. Because obviously,
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:39.280]   the historian doesn't care. They really want to, they care, obviously, deeply. But they know that
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:46.000]   history requires deep understanding of the human being in the full context. Yeah, it's a tough
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:52.080]   decision to make. - Yeah. Well, I think it's both for journalists and historians, the challenge is
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:52:01.600]   not to be too close to your subject, right? And not to be overly influenced and used by them,
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:09.920]   right? When you're talking to a living subject, which historians do, too, it's a matter of making
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:17.440]   sure that you triangulate their story with the rest of the record, right? And that may paint
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:24.160]   a different picture of the person than, and will prevent you as a journalist or a historian from
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:32.080]   kind of just telling someone else's story. And historians also have the benefit of going back
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:39.520]   30, 40 years and finding all the other stories and figuring out, playing two truths and a lie,
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:45.760]   which parts are accurate, which are not. And journalists do that work in a day-to-day basis,
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.600]   but historians, we get a little more time to think about what we're doing.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:56.240]   - Well, I personally also think it's deeply disrespectful to the populace, to people,
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:03.600]   to censor and ignore a person that's supported by a very large number of people.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:13.360]   Like, that you owe, I personally feel like you owe the citizens of this country
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:21.680]   a deep empathy and understanding of the leaders they support, even if you disagree with what they
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:29.760]   say. I mean, that's, to me, I'm much more worried about the resentment of the censorship, that it's,
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:37.120]   to having a good conversation with Donald Trump is ultimately valuable, because he, I think,
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:42.480]   especially in this case, I agree with you that Donald Trump is not a singular person.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:48.960]   He is a, he represents a set of feelings that a large number of people have. And whatever those
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:55.120]   feelings are, you can try to figure out by talking to people, but also talking to the man,
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.960]   and then seeing the interplay there, what does this really represent? In this period in history,
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:08.960]   in this slice of the world, yeah, ultimately understanding, I think, leads to compassion
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:14.000]   and love and unity, which is how this whole thing progresses. The tension between the different
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.880]   sides is useful to have a good conversation, but ultimately coming up with the right answer
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.800]   and progressing towards that answer is how you make progress. Do you think a pure democracy can
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:33.120]   work? So we have this representative democracy, with these contentious elections and so on.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:41.120]   When we start a civilization on Mars, which becomes more and more realistic technologically,
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:47.360]   we can have a more direct access to be able to vote on issues and vote for ideas. Do you think
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:57.200]   it can work? I don't think we have to go to Mars to do it, right? I think the answer is not, you
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:04.160]   know, to flip a switch and turn on something called pure democracy. When people are not ready
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:11.200]   for it, when their incentive structures are not sort of structured for it, but you can, you know,
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.920]   experiment with more democratic forms of governance, one after another, right? Whether
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:23.280]   it's, you know, sort of experimenting with technology to find new ways of sort of getting
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:31.200]   greater rates of participation in democracy. I think that we see some experiments in sort of
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:38.080]   more complicated systems of voting that in fact might actually be more reflective of people's
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.760]   choices than simply picking one candidate, right? Sort of rank choice voting or run-offs, other
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:50.000]   kinds of things. You know, I think that we can think more creatively about something like
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.120]   participatory budgeting, right? In which, you know, we put all this money into the government
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:02.400]   and then, you know, we should as a people, there are more democratic ways of sort of how we spend
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.680]   it. And I think the most urgent in some level is a more democratic form of foreign policy making,
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:13.200]   right? That foreign policy making, decision making about the military, about foreign policy
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:20.400]   is in many ways insulated from popular participation in modern American history.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:28.320]   And I think, you know, technology is not the going to solve this, you know, it's a combination
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.680]   of technology and human creativity, but I think, you know, I think we can start heading that
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:37.520]   direction. Whether we get there before we get to Mars, I don't know.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:43.920]   What interesting lessons and thoughts, if you look at the fundamentals of the history of American
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:53.520]   elections, do you hope to reveal when you try to teach the class? And how would those fundamentals
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:02.720]   be met by the students that receive that wisdom? So, what do you think about this dance? Especially
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:08.000]   such an interesting idea, and I hope you do go through with this kind of idea, is look at the
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.640]   history while the next one is happening. Yes. I think, you know, it's worth remembering,
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.920]   right, that the students who are typical American student who's in college right now,
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:30.480]   right, has lived their entire life after the election of 2000 and Bush v. Gore, right?
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:37.520]   And after 9/11 probably. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, after all of these things, right? And
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:44.720]   so, on the one hand, they take partisanship and contentious elections for granted.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:54.000]   They don't, I think, share, you know, sort of some vision that things were, you know,
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.520]   things used to be different, right? They don't remember a world that had, like, lots of moderate
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:06.800]   Democrats and liberal Republicans and, you know, sort of running around in it. But, you know,
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:13.040]   so in some ways, it's a way of looking back into the past to find other ways of organizing our
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:20.880]   politics. It's also a way of reassuring students that we have been through contentious and even
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:29.280]   violent elections before in our history. And, you know, that people have defended the right to vote,
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:35.040]   right? People have risked their lives to vote. You know, I think they will understand that as well.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:44.000]   And maybe knowledge of history here can help de-escalate the emotions you might feel about
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:51.520]   one candidate or another. And from a place of calmness, you can more easily arrive at wisdom.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.560]   That's my hope.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:03.440]   Just as a brief aside, you, brief aside, but nevertheless, you wrote the book Bound by War
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:11.040]   that describes a century of war in the Pacific. So looking at this slice of geography
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:18.240]   and power, so most crucially through the partnership between the United States and
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:24.720]   the Philippines, can you tell us some aspect of the story that is often perhaps not considered
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:31.920]   when you start to look more at the geopolitics of Europe and Soviet Union and the United States?
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:37.280]   How did the war in the Pacific define the 20th century?
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:45.680]   Yeah, I came to this book Bound by War from a sense that our stories were too lopsided
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:53.120]   toward Europe, right? That American history, when viewed from the Pacific, specifically in the 20th
[01:59:53.120 --> 02:00:02.480]   century, helps us understand American power in some new ways. Not only American projection of
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:10.720]   power into Asia, but also the ways in which American power affected people in Asia, either
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:17.120]   as in places like the Philippines where the United States had a colony for almost 50 years,
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:21.920]   or Asian Americans, people who had migrated or their descendants in the United States.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:28.000]   And those linkages between the United States and Asia, particularly the US-Philippine connection,
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.400]   I think were something that needed to be traced across the 20th century, because it's a way,
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:38.640]   kind of a new way of seeing American power from a different angle, you see it in that way.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.880]   What are some aspects that define America from when you take the perspective of the Pacific?
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.080]   What military conflict and the asymmetry of power there?
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:59.040]   Right. So I start in 1898, with the US invasion of the Philippines, its conquest and annexation.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:05.040]   And I think in many ways, this is a defining conflict of the 20th century that's often
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.560]   completely overlooked, or described, I think, incorrectly as merely a war with Spain, right?
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:17.040]   That the war in the Philippines is our first extended overseas conflict, our first conflict
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.880]   in what would come to be called the developing world or third world. It's a form of counter
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:29.280]   insurgency. You know, this is the US Army sort of learning lessons that are then repeated again in
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.360]   the Second World War, in Korea, Vietnam, and even after 9/11.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:36.400]   Is the Philippines our friends or enemies in this history?
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.600]   Well, that's the interesting part, right, is that the book focuses in particular on Filipinos
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.320]   who fight with the Americans who fought, you know, sort of in the US Army and Navy
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.360]   over the course of the 20th century, and they are in a fundamentally ironic position,
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.040]   right? They are from the Philippines, and they're fighting for the United States,
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:02.480]   which is the colonial power occupying their country. And I think that that irony persists,
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.520]   right? So if you look at sort of polling data, where they ask people all around the world,
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:11.040]   you know, do you think positively or negatively about the United States,
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:17.760]   that the highest responses are from the Philippines, right? Filipinos view the United
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:23.680]   States more favorably than people from any other country in the world, including America, right?
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:29.280]   That they think more favorably of Americans than Americans do. And so, you know, sort of unpacking
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.240]   that irony is part of what I'm trying to get at in the book.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:36.640]   What was the People Power Revolution, and what lessons can we learn from it?
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:44.080]   You kind of assign an important, a large value to it in terms of what we can learn
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:51.360]   for the American project. Yeah. So in 1986, the president of the
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.160]   Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, is overthrown by a popular revolution known as People Power,
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:03.920]   in the wake of a contested and probably almost certainly rigged election that sort of,
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:11.680]   you know, kind of confirms his rule. When that is overturned through sort of mass movements in
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:18.880]   the Philippines, it's also sort of confirmed in many ways by the reluctance of the United States
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:24.800]   to intervene to prop up a Cold War ally. Ferdinand Marcos had supported American policy throughout
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.760]   his administration. The Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan's president at the time,
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:35.520]   basically chooses not to support him. That's a personally wrenching decision for Reagan himself.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:42.720]   But he's being shaped in many ways by the emerging voices of neoconservative political,
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:48.720]   foreign policy voices, in particular, Paul Wolfowitz in the State Department and others,
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:54.800]   who see sort of movements for democracy and democratization that then kind of take fire in
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:01.440]   the late 20th century in Latin America, in South Korea, in Eastern Europe, and, you know,
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.320]   all around the world until it hits the wall in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:14.080]   Well, what's that wall? What's the wall? What do you mean by it hits the wall?
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:21.440]   So there are, you know, there are global movements for democratization, for opening up,
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.240]   you know, throughout the world, starting in the 1980s. And, you know, obviously,
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:31.680]   they continue in Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You know, I say it hits
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:40.320]   the wall in China with the protests in Tiananmen Square that are blocked and that are crushed,
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:47.280]   and I think represent a real sort of turning point in the history of democratic institutions
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:49.840]   on a global scale in the late 20th century.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:56.000]   So there's some places where the fight for freedom will work and some places not,
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.920]   and that's the kind of lesson from the 20th to take forward to the 21st century.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:09.920]   No, I think the lesson is maybe one that, you know, we talked about earlier,
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:16.240]   that there's this dynamic dance between leaders, whether totalitarian leaders
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.760]   or leaders of democratic movements, and the people that they're leading.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:24.400]   And, you know, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:29.200]   Let me ask a big ridiculous question because we talked about sort of presidential elections.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.840]   Now, this is objectively, definitively, you have to answer one person,
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:35.920]   who's the greatest president in American history?
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.840]   Oh, that's easy.
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:38.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:38.960]   Abraham Lincoln.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.800]   Is that easy? Not George Washington?
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:48.640]   You know, Washington had the statesman qualities.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:53.040]   He understood his power as the first president.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:54.560]   Also relinquished power.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:56.080]   He was willing to relinquish power.
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:06:07.440]   But Lincoln has the combination of personal leadership, a fundamental moral character,
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:15.520]   and just the ability to kind of fight the fight of politics, to play the game of it,
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:20.880]   to get where he's going, to play the short game and the long game, to kind of, you know,
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:25.840]   to work with his enemies, to block them when he had to.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:30.800]   And, you know, I mean, he gets the United States through the Civil War.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.480]   So you got to give him some credit for that.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.000]   And he's pretty good at making speeches.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:41.840]   Obviously, it helps that he's a remarkable speaker and able to convey those kinds of visions.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:48.080]   But he is first and foremost a politician, and probably the best one we have.
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.440]   Both at getting elected and at ruling.
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:56.320]   In some ways, better at the doing than at the getting elected, right?
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:04.320]   You know, the election of 1860 is a, it's just a hot mess, you know, that could have worked out
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.840]   many different ways.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:11.600]   And even the election of 1864, you know, when we have a presidential election in the middle
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.880]   of a Civil War, it was not a foregone conclusion that Lincoln would be reelected.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:24.160]   So, you know, both times he sort of, you know, he's not a master campaigner by any means,
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:27.680]   but he was a master politician as a governor.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.800]   - Do we have leaders like that today?
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:37.440]   So one perspective is like, leaders aren't, ain't what they used to be.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:42.080]   And then another perspective is, well, we always romanticize stuff that happens in the past.
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.440]   We forget the flaws and remember the great moments.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:49.360]   - Yeah, both of those things are true, right?
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:57.360]   On the one hand, you know, we are not surrounded by people of Lincoln's caliber right now.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.360]   - That feels like the case.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:03.200]   - And I think that, I think we can say that with some certainty.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:12.560]   But, you know, I always like to point to President Harry Truman, who left office with, you know,
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:19.440]   some truly abysmal presidential ratings, was dismissed as a, throughout his presidency,
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:24.960]   as a, you know, as unqualified, as not knowing what he was doing, et cetera.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:31.360]   And then, you know, turns out, with hindsight, we know that he was better at the job than anyone
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.320]   understood.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:33.760]   Better at getting elected, right?
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.000]   You remember that sign, "Dewey defeats Truman," right?
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.680]   He showed them, right?
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:43.120]   And better at holding power and better at sort of, you know, kind of building the kind of
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:50.160]   institutions that long after he was gone, demonstrated that he won the long game.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:55.120]   - And some of that is the victors do write the story.
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.600]   And I ask myself very much, how will history remember Vladimir Zelensky?
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.440]   It's not obvious.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.480]   And how will history remember Putin?
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.760]   That too is not obvious.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:20.000]   Because it depends on how the role, the geopolitics, the, how the nations, how the history of these
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.400]   nations unravel, unfold, rather.
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:25.920]   So it's very interesting to think about.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:36.720]   And the same is true for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Obama, George Bush, Bill Clinton, and so on.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:43.520]   I think it's probably an unanswerable question of which of the presidents will be remembered
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:45.040]   as a great president from this time.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.600]   You can make all kinds of cases for all kinds of people, and they do.
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:51.120]   But it's unclear.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.560]   It's fascinating to think about when the robots finally take over, which of the humans
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.840]   they will appreciate the most.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.800]   Let me ask for advice.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:09.920]   Do you have advice for young folks as they, 'cause you mentioned the folks you're teaching,
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.520]   they don't even, they don't know what it's like to have waited on the internet for the
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:16.320]   thing to load up.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:19.360]   For every single web page, it's suffering.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:23.520]   They don't know what it's like to not have the internet and have a dial phone that goes
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.200]   (mimics dial tone) and then the joy of getting angry at somebody and hanging up with a physical
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:29.440]   phone.
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.640]   They don't know any of that.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:37.440]   So for those young folks that look at the contentious elections, that look at our contentious
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:43.200]   world, our divided world, what advice would you give them of how to have a career they
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:47.760]   can be proud of, let's say they're in college or in high school, and how to have a life
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.640]   they can be proud of?
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.160]   - Oh man, that's a big question.
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:56.000]   Yeah, I've never given a graduation speech.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.920]   - This is like warmup.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:00.560]   Let's look for raw materials before you write it.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:12.800]   - If I did, I think I would advise students that history teaches that you should be more
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.440]   optimistic than your current surroundings suggest, right?
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:23.600]   And I think it would be very easy as a young person today to think there's nothing I can
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.040]   do about this politics.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.280]   There's nothing I can say to this person on the other side of the aisle.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:35.680]   There's nothing I can do about the planet, et cetera, and just sort of give up.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:44.640]   And I think history teaches that we don't know who the winners and losers are in the
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.920]   long run, but we know that the people who give up are always the losers, right?
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:53.040]   - So don't give in to cynicism or apathy.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.680]   - Yeah.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.680]   - Optimism paves the way.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:03.200]   - Yeah, because human beings are deeply resilient and creative, even under far more difficult
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:07.120]   circumstances than we face right now.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.040]   - Well, let me ask a question that you don't even need to, that you wouldn't even dare
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:14.880]   cover in your graduation commencement speech.
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.800]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:18.160]   Why are we here?
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:24.800]   This whole project that history studies and analyzes as if there's a point to the whole
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.320]   thing, what is the point?
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:34.880]   All the wars, all the presidents, all the struggles to discover what it means to be
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.320]   human or reach for a higher ideal, why?
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:40.960]   Why do you think we're here?
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.600]   - Hmm.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:52.960]   I think this is where there is often a handoff from the historian to the clergy, right?
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.460]   - Yes.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:13:01.840]   - You know, who, but in the end, there's less distance between the two than you think,
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:03.360]   right?
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:08.960]   That, you know, if you think about some of the kind of answers to that question, what
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:16.400]   is the meaning of life that are given from religious traditions, often they have a fundamentally
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:18.320]   historical core, right?
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:25.280]   It's about, you know, unifying the past and the present in some other, you know, non-earthly
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:26.800]   sort of dimension.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:31.280]   And, you know, so I think there is that.
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:37.840]   I think even for people who don't have religious belief, there's a way in which history
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.280]   and is about the shared human condition.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:48.560]   And I think historians aspire to telling all of that story, right?
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:56.800]   You know, we drill down on the miseries of war and depressions and so forth, but, you
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:03.520]   know, the story is not complete without, you know, blueberries and butterflies and all
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:05.680]   the rest that go with it.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:15.360]   - So both the humbling and the inspiring aspect that you get by looking back at human history
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.080]   that we're in this together.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.000]   Christopher, this is a huge honor.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.360]   This is an amazing conversation.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.640]   Thank you for taking us back to a war that not often discussed, but in many ways defined
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:34.480]   the 20th century and the century we are in today, which is the First World War.
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:41.040]   The war that was supposed to end all wars, but instead defined the future wars and defines
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:43.840]   our struggle to try to avoid World War III.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:46.400]   So it's a huge honor you to talk with me today.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.680]   This is amazing.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:48.400]   Thank you so much.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.200]   - Thank you.
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.680]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Christopher Capozzola.
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:56.880]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:04.400]   And now let me leave you with some words from Woodrow Wilson in 1917 about World War I that
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.560]   haunted the rest of the 20th century.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.080]   "This is a war to end all wars."
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:18.080]   George Santana, a Spanish-American philosopher responded to this quote in 1922 by saying,
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:21.760]   "Only the dead have seen the end of war."
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.120]   Thank you for listening.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.640]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:29.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:32.160]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:42.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
