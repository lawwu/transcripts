[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter and the seventh verse.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   The seventh verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   according to the riches of his grace."
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I want in particular this morning to deal with that last phrase,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "according to the riches of his grace."
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We come to consider this verse for the third time,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and I trust that I need make no apology for doing so.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   There are many ways of considering and of studying the scripture,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and by now I think it must be perfectly plain and clear that I am a follower
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and an exponent of one particular method.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I regard the scriptures and these great statements as being similar and comparable,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   if you like, to a great art gallery,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   where there are great and famous and wonderful paintings hanging upon the walls.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Now there are some people who visit such places in some such way as this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   They buy a copy of the guide at the door,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and with guide in hand they walk round the gallery.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   They notice that item number one is a painting by Van Dyck, let us say,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and they say, "Oh, that's Van Dyck," and then they pass on to item number two,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and there is something by Rembrandt, and, "Oh, that's Rembrandt, a famous picture,"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and they go on to number three and so on.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Well, I am prepared to grant and to admit that that is perhaps a possible way
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   of viewing the treasures of an art gallery.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And yet there is something within me that makes me feel that when such a person
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   has gone right round this art gallery and has said,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   "Well, now we've done the National Gallery, and let us now go to the Tate Gallery,"
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and proceed to go round the Tate Gallery in the same way,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and really believe that they have done both of these famous galleries,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   there is something within me that makes it protest
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and makes me feel like saying that they've never seen either,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and that really they've never stood before and have gazed upon and have seen
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   the treasures that are there before them.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Well, now it's exactly the same with the Scripture.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   There are people who walk through this first chapter of this mighty epistle to the Ephesians
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   in some such manner as that, and they tabulate it and they classify it,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and they feel they've done the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But have they?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Have they really discovered the truth?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Ah, my friends, it seems to me to be much better
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   to stand, if necessary, for hours before a masterpiece,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   before something that has been given to us by God himself through his Spirit.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Let us look at it and gaze upon it and try to receive the totality of its riches,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   if we can, before we pass on.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   There is a danger, in other words, that we may be familiar with the letter of the Scripture
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   but never really receive the Spirit.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We may be familiar with the superficialities, with the mechanics, as it were,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and may have that kind of superficial knowledge of and acquaintance with
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   the statements of Scripture.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But after all, the Scriptures were meant to feed the soul and to enrich the mind
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and to move the heart.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And if we are to experience that, well, I say we must tarry with these things.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We must drink in, we must take the fullness,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and only then move on to something else.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Very well, we are looking at this great statement for the third time.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And especially this morning, I say we stand and look at this particular part of it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   "According to the riches of his grace."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   There is surely a point at which everyone must want to stop.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   There is something which surely all must feel like analyzing.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Because there is nothing in the whole range of Scripture which is richer
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   than this particular statement.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Indeed, this entire verse contains within itself the essence of the whole Gospel.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And that is the amazing thing about it, the way in which the Apostle,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   under the inspiration of the Spirit, is able to reduce it all to this phrase,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   which he puts before us and then expects us to meditate upon,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and to pray over, and to think about, until our hearts shall be ravished by it,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   even as his heart undoubtedly was when he first wrote it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Now, you notice the way in which the Apostle comes to this particular statement.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He has first of all reminded us that the method or the mode of our salvation is by ransoming.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He uses the word redemption, specifically, in order to bring us that idea.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Then, having told us that from our terrible plight we have been delivered by ransoming,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   he tells us that the first thing that we appreciate as the result of that,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and the first thing that we realize is, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   That is the first immediate result, as we saw last Sunday morning.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But now, he can't leave it at that, and he never could.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   What is it that makes all this possible?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   What is it that gives us this ransoming, this forgiveness of sins that we enjoy?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And the answer is, as it always must be, the riches of his grace.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Of course, in a sense, the Apostle has already been saying this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   There's nothing else to say.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He's been saying it from the very first verse.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   He says it everywhere.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He himself is an Apostle by the will of God, which is just another way of saying, by the grace of God.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   For if God had not been a God of grace, he could never have willed such a thing with such a man.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So he's already been saying it and repeating it time and again from the very beginning.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   But you never tire of a thing like this, it's everything.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But we do notice that there is one change.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The Apostle in verse 6, for instance, has used this term "grace".
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   But there you notice he says, "to the praise of the glory of his grace".
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But here there is something different.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Here he speaks of the riches of his grace.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Grace, as he thinks of it in verse 6, and as we saw when we were studying it,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   grace is one of the manifestations of the glory of God.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   It is one of those facets of that eternal brightness that flashes upon us.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Everything in God is glorious, and the glory of God is manifested in an infinite variety of ways,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and grace is one of them, and one of the most notable.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So there it was, "the glory of his grace".
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But here there is this change to "the riches of his grace".
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Why the change?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, it seems to me that the answer is perfectly clear.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   There in that 6th verse, as a part of the whole statement of verses 3 to 6,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   the Apostle was looking at salvation from the Godwards angle, or standpoint if you like.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And there naturally the thing that strikes him above everything is the glory of God's grace.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But here he has already been thinking of us, he's talking about the forgiveness of sins,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   so he's looking at it from the manward aspect.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And grace, whenever it's looked at from the manward side,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   is always something that must convey to us this idea of riches.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And that is why the Apostle introduces the phrase at this point.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Now, this is of course one of the Apostle's most characteristic,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and obviously one of his most favorite statements.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Here he is talking about the riches of his grace.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Listen to him in the 2nd chapter, verse 4, "But God," he says, "who is rich in mercy,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   for his great love wherewith he loved us."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Same idea, there it is in the 7th verse of the 2nd chapter again,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   "that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And again in the 3rd chapter, in the 8th verse, you have it, he says, "Unto me,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You see, he can't stop saying it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It obviously was the thing that filled the mind and the heart of this mighty Apostle.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It was something that ravished his heart.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Grace was to him, in the words of Philip Todridge,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   "a most charming sound, melodious to his ears."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It was the thing, I say, that had ravished his heart and had moved his entire being.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And he never mentions the word grace in a sense,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   except that he goes off into some kind of ecstasy and produces his superlatives
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and all his great adjectives.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The thing had so gripped him and amazed him and moved him
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   that he can scarcely control himself.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And of course that was the result of the wonderful thing that had happened to him.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   He never got over it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   He would have been a persecutor and a blasphemer and injurious, insulting.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   He would have thought with himself that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   He would have been a self-satisfied, proud, contented Pharisee,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   bursting and smug in his little self-righteousness,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   that he of all men should ever have been forgiven and above all called to the Apostolate,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   made a preacher of the Gospel, sent out as the special emissary to the Gentiles.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   He never got over it.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And he looked at himself and was amazed.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   He seems to ask himself, "Is it possible?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Am I still Saul of Tarsus?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Am I still the same man?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And if I am, what accounts for my being what I am now?"
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And there was only one answer, "I am what I am by the grace of God,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   the riches of His grace."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It was because of that, of course, the Apostle was so constantly moved by it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And his greatest desire in life was that everybody might know this,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   that everybody might experience the riches of God's grace.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   There it is, you see, in that third chapter in the eighth verse.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   That's his calling.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   "And to me, one less than the least of all saints is this grace given."
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   What grace? Well, the grace of being a preacher. Why?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   "That I might declare and preach among the Gentiles beyond searchable riches of Christ."
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It was the thing that drove him across continents and across seas
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   that made him preach day and night with tears and pleading.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It was the vital motive force in the whole of his existence.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   It was the thing that constrained him, as he puts it.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It was the thing that made him say, "Woe is unto me
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   if I preach not the gospel."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   The thought of these riches of God's grace
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   and the ignorance of men and women concerning it.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And of course, it is the one thing that makes him write this epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   as he tells us.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Why does he write for them? Write to them?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Well, he tells us that he is writing to them
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   because they are constantly in his mind and he is always praying for them.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   What is he praying for them?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Well this, "That the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   that ye may know," what?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Well, the various aspects of the riches of his grace.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   He goes on and repeats it again in the third chapter, exactly the same thing.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He says, "It is for this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory,"
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   there it is again, "to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner men."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Why?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Well, "For this reason, that they might know the love of Christ,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   which passes knowledge in its height and depth and length and breadth."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   That was his desire.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   It was the thing that led him to write the letter
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and to be praying constantly for these Ephesians.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   He wants them to know the riches of God's grace.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Very well, my friends, let me ask a question at this point.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Do we know them?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Do we know the riches of God's grace?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Have we experienced them?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Are we aware of them?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Ah yes, we've read, we've studied, we've done the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   That isn't what I'm asking.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I'm asking, do you know the riches of God's grace?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   There's a very good way in which we can answer that question.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   To know the riches of God's grace invariably leads to the same result as it did in the case of Paul,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   and that is to make us sing, to make us praise God,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   to make us rejoice, to rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   You see, it was because he knew the riches that the apostle writes about them,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   prays about them, goes into his ecstasies about them,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   produces his superlatives.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It was the thing itself.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   What can I say, he seems to ask.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   How can I express what it all means to me?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And it's been the same always, throughout the centuries.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   You notice Paul's adjectives.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   He says that God has caused it to abound towards us.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   He talks about the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   He talks about the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   His language seems to be inadequate.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   The thing itself is so tremendous, and you notice it's not confined to this apostle.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You get it in the hymns.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   We had it in that hymn that we have just been singing.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   John Wesley translates that hymn, you remember, of Count Zinzendorf.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And you notice the terms that he there uses.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   "Whose boundless mercy," he says, "has for me."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It's a boundless mercy.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   There's no limit to it.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   There's no end to it.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Listen to his brother Charles saying the same thing.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "Tis mercy all," says Charles Wesley, "immense and free."
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And Isaac Watson saying the same thing.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   He says, "When I survey the wondrous cross."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   He doesn't just say, "I've seen the cross," and pass on.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   He stands and he surveys it.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He stops, then he can't move.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   He's transfixed by it.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   "I survey the wondrous cross."
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Now, this is something, then, I say that is characteristic of all the saints in all ages,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   and irrespective of any natural differences which may be true from case to case.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And therefore I ask my question, do we know the riches of God's grace?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Now, my dear friends, I'm increasingly convinced that it's our failure at this point
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   that accounts for all our troubles, and all our problems, and all our failures,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   our lives, most of them as Christians, are bound in shallows and in miseries.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   How different we are from these New Testament people.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Where is the note of triumph and of joy and of praise and of thanksgiving?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Are our hearts moved and ravished?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Do we know something ecstatic?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Not that we ask for feelings or ecstasies as such,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   but I say that no man can appreciate true wealth and riches
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   without responding to it in amazement.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   There is no question at all that one of the most delicate and subtle and sensitive tests
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   of our Christian profession is the extent to which we are amazed.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I've reminded you that Paul never got over it.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   He was amazed at himself, amazed that he was a Christian,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   amazed that he was an apostle and a preacher.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Amazement! Love so amazing, so divine.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Have we seen it? Have we appreciated these riches?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Now I'm suggesting that it is because so many of us haven't,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   that we are constantly grumbling and complaining and asking questions,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and we can't see this, and we can't understand that,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and our whole life is miserable, and we look miserable,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and we never attract a soul to Christ,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and we expect somebody else always to be doing it for us,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   but instead of being all of us evangelists as we should be in our daily lives and living,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   it's because we've never seen this.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's because we don't know it, the riches of his grace.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Very well, let us look at it together hurriedly this morning.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I say hurriedly, advisedly, because with a theme like this you can only indicate certain aspects,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   which I trust will lead us to meditation and to thought and to contemplation
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   when we've gone home and as we use this day to the glory of God.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Now then, how do we estimate riches? How do we compute this great wealth?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I know that in a sense I'm saying an impossible task,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   because the apostle himself has said, "To know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   But the fact that we can never spend it and fully comprehend it
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   doesn't mean that we don't look at it at all.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   No, no, let's go as far as we can and then let's go on from there the next time
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and let's go on and on. I believe eternity will be spent in that way by most of us.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   That is heaven, it seems to me, that is the glory of eternity.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Discovering fresh aspects of the riches,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   entering into further wonderful appreciations of this glory of God's grace.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Well now then, the first test I would suggest is this.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   A good way of telling the worth and the value of great riches
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   is to know something of the price that was paid for it.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's a good test with a painting, isn't it, a picture or with any work of art.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   What's it valued at? What's the price that has to be paid before it can be possessed?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I'm not staying with this this morning because in a sense we've already considered it.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   But God forbid that we should be so mechanical as to say because we considered it last Sunday
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   that we don't mention it today.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   There should never be a service or an occasion when we don't mention the precious blood of Christ
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   in whom we have redemption through his blood.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I confess the Christians I don't understand are those who stay at home on Sunday night saying,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   "Ah, we know the evangelistic message."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Do you? Do you know all about the blood of Christ?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Do you feel you really know so much about it and all about it in that sense
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   that really it can add nothing fresh to you?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   A Christian who doesn't receive something in an evangelistic service
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   is to put it at its very lowest in the most unhealthy condition.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   If your heart isn't made to beat faster every time you hear about the blood of Christ
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   you're not like the Apostle Paul.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   That's the cost. That's the price.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   In whom we have redemption through his blood.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Not gold and silver. Not platinum and uranium.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Not the most precious metals in the world. No, no.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   The blood of the Son of God.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   The poured out life of him by whom all things were made
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and by whom all things consist.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   That's the value.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   That's the way of estimating the riches of God's grace.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   But let me come to other aspects.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   The second I would mention is this.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   The munificent way in which God gives us these riches.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   That is in itself an expression of the riches.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Now this is in a sense the great theme of the whole Bible.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We have redemption through his blood according to the riches of his grace.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   It means this.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   That all we have is not the result of our request to God.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   It is all from God.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Now it's a very wonderful thing if you go to a great or a wealthy person
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   and make a request or ask for a gift
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   and he having considered it says, "Very well, I'll give it to you."
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   "You're very grateful and rightly so."
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And that's a very wonderful thing.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And he's generous because he does it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But oh, when we think of this great salvation
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   that kind of thing must vanish out of our thoughts altogether.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   God doesn't forgive us because we ask him to forgive us.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   God didn't send his Son into the world
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   because mankind kept on pleading with him to do so.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   There is no part, there is nothing in salvation
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   which is given to us by God by way of response to a request from us.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   None whatsoever.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   It is all and entirely and absolutely from God.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   The riches of his grace.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   He's given without being asked.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   He's poured it out without any request.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   It is indeed in spite of us.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   In spite of our being enemies and aliens and rebels
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and turning our backs upon him,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   it is in spite of all that, that God has done it all.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   The riches of his grace.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   The wealth you see that overflowed as it were, in spite of us.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Or another way you can look at it is to look at it like this.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   That the apostle is emphasizing here that God gives to us
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   not in a grudging manner,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   but with a kind of liberality and largesse,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   which baffles description.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   James, I think, had something like this in his mind
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   when in that first chapter, you remember,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   he tells us that if any of us lacks wisdom,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   we should ask God.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And he says of God, "Who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   What a wonderful conception.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   If I may say it with reverence, God can't give in any other way.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   God doesn't give grudgingly, he can't.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   The nature of God makes that impossible.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   God must be liberal.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   He giveth liberally, he giveth altogether.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   God can only act in one manner, because he is God.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And that is that he gives with this fullness, with this freedom,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   with this superabundance, without let or hindrance or limit.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   God gives all, as it were, always.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   He doesn't give grudgingly.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   The apostles' way of putting that, of course,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   is, as I've already reminded you in the third chapter,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   to say that it passes knowledge.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   He talks about measurements that we're bound to.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   We think in terms of height and depth and length and breadth,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   and we must, we are in time and we are bound by measures,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   and we've got ideas of vastness, and we've got our telescopes,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   our theodolites, we can measure and we can chart these things.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   "Very well," says Paul, "come along, bring all your measurements
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and all your agencies, let's try to measure it,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   let's try to put it on paper.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Height, depth, length, breadth, nonsense," says Paul.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   "Go as far as you can and still you haven't begun."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It passes knowledge.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's a never-ebbing sea.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   You think you see across it and you swim out into it,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   and then there's still another horizon, and another, and another, and another.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It's God, it's eternity, it's endless.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   It's a vast abyss.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   It passes knowledge.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Oh, the riches of God's grace.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   They're as large and as great and profound as God himself,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   because you see, when God did this thing for our salvation,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   he gave himself in his Son.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And so all the riches of God's grace are really God himself.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   He's treasured up all his treasures of wisdom and of grace in the Son.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   It's all in Christ.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   So the measure of the riches of God's grace
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   is the measure of the person of the Son of God.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   So we can say in our puny, inadequate language
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   that the riches of God's grace are inexhaustible,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   the riches of God's grace are illimitable,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   the riches of God's grace are all-sufficient.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And that's the astounding thing.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Here are you and I this morning, needy.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Needing so many things, we've come into a large place, as the psalmist puts it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   We've come into a wealthy place.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I cried unto the Lord in my distress, and he brought me into a large, into a wealthy place.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   That's where we've come.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That's where we always come when we come to consider the Gospel.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And my friend, it is my privilege to say this to you,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   that the riches of God's grace for you and for me this morning are inexhaustible.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   The saints of the centuries have been drinking out of this fountain.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It's as full this morning as it was at the beginning.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Millions yet will drink out of it.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   It will still be bubbling up to the very surface.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   It's inexhaustible. It's endless.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And it is all-sufficient.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I care not what your need may be.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I care not what your problem.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   There is nothing that can ever afflict the human heart, the human life,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   but that it is dealt for.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Jesus doeth all things well.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   If a man comes to me and says, "Christ, ye shall never thirst again."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Never.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Never thirst.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   All-sufficient.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Fully satisfying.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Very well, Sir Simon.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   You are using your terms and your adjectives.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You are dealing in generalities.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Can't you come down to particulars?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   When you say that there is everything I need in Christ,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I don't follow you, I feel full of need at this moment.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   What exactly do you mean?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   You are dazzling me in a sense by your superlatives.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   What does it mean in detail?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Well, I can only mention some of the things this morning.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Here we are going to look at some of the details of this riches of God's grace.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   First of all, the thing is already mentioned.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Free forgiveness.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Free forgiveness.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   The riches of His grace.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   No payment whatsoever.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   He doesn't demand anything.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "O everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Come, buy without money and without price."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   How do you realize that?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I think there are some in this congregation who are unhappy in their spiritual lives and existence
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   because they haven't realized their first truth.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   They are still trying to bring some kind of cash.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   They are still trying to bring some sort of payment.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   They say, "I am not good enough yet, I am trying to be."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   My dear friend, give it up.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It's without money and without price.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Not a farthing, not a cent.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   There is nothing demanded as payment.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   There will be nothing received as payment.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   It is the riches of His grace.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Is there anything more insulting to a person who is giving you a gift out of the largesse of his heart and of his mind
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   than to put your hand in your pocket and say, "Now I'd like to give you something for that."
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's insulting.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And haven't we all been insulting the Almighty God?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Realize my friend that salvation is as the result of the riches of His grace.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Nothing to pay, absolutely free.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It's the free grace of God.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It is a free salvation.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   "Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   That's the language of the Christians.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   "Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   naked come to thee for dress, helpless look to thee for grace."
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   That's it.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   The riches of His grace.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's a free forgiveness.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   But come along, it's a full forgiveness.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   That's still more marvelous.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I mentioned it last Sunday morning.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Let me just say a word in passing therefore.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Let me put it like this this morning.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   When God forgives your sins, He keeps nothing at all back.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It's a full forgiveness.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   There's no reservation.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   There are no conditions either.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   He doesn't say, "Now I'm going to forgive you on condition."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Not at all.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "I forgive you," says God, "because He bore the punishment of your sins."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   He justifies us freely, fully.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Your past sins are forgiven, your present sins are forgiven,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   your future sins are already dealt with there.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   There are no conditions, there are no reservations.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It is a full forgiveness.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Oh, the riches of His grace.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Shall I say something that may sound daring to some of you?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   If you are a Christian, you know God's book of the law, as far as you are concerned, is put on one side.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   That ledger will never be brought out again.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   We are justified once and forever.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It is a full forgiveness.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Oh, the riches of His grace.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   More than that, it is a complete reconciliation to God.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   If you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, if you believe that He has died for your sins and borne your punishment,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   if you are resting only upon Him this morning,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I suggest to you, I tell you, I proclaim authoritatively to you,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   that you have a complete reconciliation to God.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Did you know that?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Did you know that there is nothing between you and God because Christ has died for you?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Did you know that you have been fully restored to the fellowship of God,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   as much as Adam had it before he fell, and more, because you are in Christ?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Are you enjoying this full fellowship with God?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   When you go to God in prayer, do you go with a craven spirit, hesitant and doubtful,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   or do you go realizing that the way to God is absolutely opened by the blood of Jesus?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   That's the teaching of the scripture, and it's an aspect of the riches of His grace.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'm afraid that many of us, you know, are like the prodigal son, aren't we?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Yes, in desperation we go back and we go home and we believe certain things.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   But oh, how inadequate was his idea and his conception of his father's love.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   He was going in fear and trembling and saying, "Father, I've done this, make me as one of thy hired servants."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   "What you're talking about, boy?" says the father.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "Bring out that robe, bring out the ring, go and kill the fatted calf."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   That's God's way of full reconciliation.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   As if that prodigal boy had never done any wrong.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   As if he'd never been insulting before he left home.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   As if he'd never left home at all.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Everything's forgotten and banished.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   The reconciliation is a complete one.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's an entire one.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It's like that with God as far as you and I are concerned.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   If we are trusting to Christ, it's a full reconciliation.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Oh, it was all in that hymn that we sang just now, that translation of Count Zinfandorf's hymn.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Yes, but you know the riches of God's grace go beyond even that.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Not only is all there, two of us, according to the riches of God's grace, we can know it.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We can have knowledge of it and assurance of it and certainty concerning it here and now.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   It would be a marvelous and a wonderful thing if God had thus reconciled us in Christ
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   and hadn't told us that he'd done so, wouldn't it?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   It would be a marvelous thing if all of us, when we came to die, had a sudden surprise.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   All through our lives we'd felt we'd sinned against God and that he couldn't forgive us
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and we'd been miserable and unhappy.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   But at last, at the moment of death, God suddenly tells us,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   "You know I've forgiven you all the time since you trusted in Christ."
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   That would have been marvelous to be told at the end.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   But we are talking about the riches of God's grace, and God doesn't do it like that.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   God doesn't merely do it, God does it and he tells you that he has done it.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Full assurance of faith, full assurance of hope.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   We rejoice, being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God and rejoice.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   That's it.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And it's everywhere in these scriptures.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You have no right as a Christian not to know that your sins are forgiven.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You have no right to be lacking assurance of salvation.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   It is your birthright, God's given it, it's a part of the bargain.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's something he's thrown in, as it were, according to the riches of his grace, to know it.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Oh, but time passes and words fail me.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Sonship, adoption, we've already dealt with them, go back over them.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Repeat, revise, don't say we've done adoption, go back to adoption
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and stay there until you're on your feet praising God because you've been adopted.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   You don't understand adoption until you've done this.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   To be in Christ, there it is again.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And go on and consider the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   The thing the apostles bring in later on in this first chapter,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   our being sealed by the Spirit of God until the time of the redemption of the purchased possession,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   the gift of the Spirit.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   The power of the Holy Spirit working in us, that's the thing again he prays for
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   at the end of this first chapter and again in the third chapter.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   He says, "If only you knew this exceeding greatness of his power toward us would that believe."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   You see, God doesn't just save us and forgive our sins and then leave us to ourselves
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   to fight the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   No, no, he's given the gift of the Spirit.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And by the Spirit Christ dwells in us.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And he is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   There it is.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Don't talk to me about problems.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Emphasize if you like the devil and the world and the flesh.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   But here is the power that brought Christ up again from the dead.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Offered to you according to the riches of his grace.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   That's a part of it.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And then something else, which in many ways is the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Listen to the apostle saying it in the second chapter.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Here he is telling us this astounding thing about us.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   That we, all of us, have got access into the presence of God
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   as the result of the riches of his grace.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   For through him, through Christ, we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Heaven means being in the presence of God and enjoying him without let or hindrance or restraint.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Do you know that according to the riches of God's grace we are given a foretaste of that here in this world?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   We have access to the Father.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   By Christ through the Spirit, it's all the result of the riches of his grace.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Oh, my beloved Christian friends, do you know God?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Are you enjoying God?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Are you enjoying a life of fellowship with God?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Do you know God intends you to have that? It's a part of the riches of his grace.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   It was one of the reasons for sending his Son.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And you mustn't be content with anything less.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   You must believe these words, you must believe the message.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Don't wait for a feeling, take the word first and actually believe it.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Accept it.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   God has made this possible.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And we are to receive of these riches.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And then he goes on to talk about Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Indeed he goes on to say something still more astounding.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   We are to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Don't ask me what that means.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I can't tell you, I don't know.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   But I do know this, that if Christ is in my heart, the fullness of God is in my heart.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And I believe that he is so.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   The thing is we are to enjoy it more and more.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   The fullness of God.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Christ in our hearts by faith, I say then and all, this fullness.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And spiritual manifestations of the Son of God.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Times when he comes to you and you know he is there, not that you see him with the naked eye.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   But you know and feel that he is present.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   All that is offered according to the riches of his grace.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Not only forgiveness and then the weary struggle and the ignorance and the hoping.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   No, no.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Children of the heavenly King as he journeys sweetly sing.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Do you know that celestial fruit can grow even in this earthly ground that we are still on?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   We have the first fruit says Paul.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   We have tasted the foretaste of all that God has got in its fullness for us, awaiting us in heaven.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   And then think of the armour that he speaks of in the last chapter of this great epistle.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Every provision that we need, that we may withstand in the evil day against the viles of Satan.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Every part of us covered completely.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   There are some aspects of the riches of his grace.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And all this of course leads to joy and it leads to peace and it leads to love.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   It leads to a sense of security and of safety.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And all that I remember is simply with reference to our life in time and life in this world.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And then lift up your eyes.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Awaiting us the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   The inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Reserved in him for us who are in Christ.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's all there and it's all a part of the riches of his grace.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   We shall see him, we shall be with him, we shall reign with him, we shall enjoy him, we shall be lords of the universe with him.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   That's the riches of God's grace.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   You see we need to have corrected the ideas of the prodigal son.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   When we go back to God we don't go back as servants, we go back as sons.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And we enjoy all that the father's heart and love have for us.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And my dear friends all that is being offered to you and to me this morning.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Shall I end then by putting it in the words of a well-known hymn.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   What you and I must say as we contemplate all this is just this.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blood to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   O Lamb of God I come.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Just as I am poor, wretched, blind, sight-wretched, healing of the mind.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Yea all I need in thee to find.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   O Lamb of God I come.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Poor pauper rise up and in your rags and your penury go to him.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Receive of the riches of his grace.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Believe him when he tells you that all this and infinitely more is available now.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And hold out your hand and receive it and rejoice.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   And begin to be amazed at the riches of his grace.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Amen.
