[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   To Instagram or not to Instagram? That is the question today. Specifically, should we Instagram
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.880]   our good works? We have sharp listeners sending us very sharp questions, and today's sharp
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.760]   question comes from a sharp listener named Steven who lives in Texas. "Pastor John, hello. You
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   recently tweeted this. 'Let another praise you and not your own mouth.' That's Proverbs 27.2.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.760]   And don't mess it up by retweeting the praise. Of course everyone notices,'" you said, Pastor John,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.960]   "to which I wholeheartedly agree with you." And I retweeted it as a matter of fact. "But I also
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120]   see a lot of social media photos of Christians doing good deeds, say, and helping with hurricane
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.360]   relief. So my question is, where and how do we draw the line between letting our light shine
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160]   before others so that they may see our good works and give glory to our Father who is in heaven?"
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.760]   That's Jesus' command in Matthew 5.16. "And yet being careful not to practice our righteousness
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.160]   before other people in order to be seen by them." That's Jesus' command in Matthew 6.1.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.080]   Any thoughts on how to balance these two truths on social media?
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.320]   Okay, let's put the texts in front of us, and then I'll try to make some distinctions. First,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.240]   Jesus lays down this warning and principle in Matthew 6.1. "Beware of practicing your righteousness
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.080]   before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.480]   who's in heaven." Now, that's a kind of aim to be seen, which is evil, he says. Shouldn't do it.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:44.640]   And part of the evil of the aim to be seen is that it signals you are not content with your Father's
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.280]   reward. You need to add. You crave a human praise, and so God's reward is not sufficient for you.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   You need to supplement it by a little human adulation, and that's what makes it so evil.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   Then Jesus gives us an example of what he means with regard to doing good to the needy in the next
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.360]   four verses. He says this. This is Matthew 6.2. "Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   before you. Don't tweak your soup kitchen stint at Thanksgiving, as the hypocrites do in the
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.960]   synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly I say to you, they have
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.280]   received their reward, not from God, but from man." Obviously, God's wasn't enough. "But when
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." In other
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:01.360]   words, do it so quietly that your right hand is able to make the gift to the needy, and your left
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.280]   hand was just hanging at the other side, didn't even know what happened. "So that your giving may
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.600]   be in secret, and your father who sees in secret will reward you." So there's the warning and the
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:26.560]   principle. Don't aim to be praised by others, and therefore avoid behaviors that look like that,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.440]   like sounding a trumpet, or tweeting, or Instagramming, your piety and your good deeds.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.080]   I have a real problem with people who simply say, "Praying for all the hurt people in Las Vegas."
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.040]   Well, now, if you want to call people to prayer, yes. If you want to quote a Bible verse that would
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.600]   encourage people to pray, but I just don't get it when people say, "Hey, hey everybody, I want to
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   tell about 10,000 people I'm praying." Okay, don't want to be too hard, but I just don't get that.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.320]   It just seems so contrary to this text, like when you pray, go into your closet. In fact, it says,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.280]   "Make a concerted effort that your righteousness, your generosity to the poor not be seen by others,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.320]   but be done in secret." Now, here's the counterpoint that Stephen is referring to in Matthew 5,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.440]   14 to 16 that creates the problem, and it is a real problem. I don't presume to have all the
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.840]   answers here, but here's the problem. Jesus says in Matthew 5, 14, "You are the light of the world.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.800]   A city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people put a lamp, nor do people light a lamp
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.200]   and put it under a basket, but on a stand that it may give light to all in the house. In the same
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.440]   your Father who is in heaven." So here's a few observations. One, there are many practical good
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   deeds that simply cannot be hidden, especially from those for whom you're doing the deeds.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.640]   You can't stop and help somebody change a tire without them watching you do it.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.800]   You can't risk your life at a public act of terrorism to rescue a child without the crowd
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.720]   seeing what you're doing. You can't join an emergency sandbagging effort to prevent flooding
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.080]   without being part of a hundred people who are doing the same thing. My guess is that this is
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:38.560]   what Jesus has in mind. He's mainly talking about public doing of good deeds of mercy and justice
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   that you can't hide because they're public. I suspect, in fact, that Paul is thinking about
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:53.680]   those in 1 Timothy 5:25 when he says, "So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   are not cannot remain hidden." I'll bet he's pondering this. In other words, there are many
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   kinds of good deeds which simply by their very nature can't be hidden, and there are some that
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:15.360]   can be. Like if you go online to click and give whatever amount you want to give,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.760]   there's a little button that says "Give anonymously." A real test, right? I want them to
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:33.440]   know I did this! I don't think so. By their very nature, some can be hidden, and Paul says they're
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.360]   going to be found out later. Somebody's going to know, and he's okay with that. And I think so
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   should we be, because later it will probably have more possibilities of bringing glory to God rather
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.760]   than bringing glory to you, because people will realize you never did try to draw attention to it,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   and yet you were doing it, and it came out at your funeral. Second observation. Matthew 5:16 makes
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:08.560]   clear the goal in all our good deeds is never merely the temporal, material well-being of the
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.080]   person we care about. This is so important for people who are into social justice and other
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:22.880]   kinds of wonderful things, but don't care about God getting the glory. He says the eternal well-being
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.880]   of the person in worshiping, being part of the worshiping family of God, is the goal of all of
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.960]   our good deeds to them. We want their temporal needs to be met so that their eternal praise
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.560]   would go to God. That's the great goal. Christians are never merely public do-gooders. We do not want
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   to be known as merely public do-gooders. We want people to know God, love God, serve God, glorify
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.440]   God, be saved and with God forever. This is the great passion of mercy ministries and justice
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.920]   ministries, and if it's not, we're probably being politically correct in order to win the praise
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:16.480]   of whatever group we happen to prize at the time. Third observation. We all know that there is a
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:26.000]   way to act publicly which gives the impression that you crave the approval and the praise of
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.800]   other people. Certainly comes to the fore in Twitter and Instagram and other social media.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:43.280]   And we know this is merely human. It's not godly. And so nobody is going to think of glorifying God
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:50.000]   when they see us do it, right? I mean, I look at things, I'm not the least inclined to glorify God
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.720]   when some Christian toots his own horn about all the good things he's doing. I'm just kind of,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.000]   "Oh, roll them eyes, think of it." There goes a few more millennial people who look at all of us
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.560]   Christians and say, "Well, I'm done with that because that's just purely human." So I conclude
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:16.720]   that Jesus is calling for both in Matthew 5 and 6. So let me sum it up like this.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   One, that we should be deeply content with the reward of God, knowing him, loving him,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.720]   treasuring him as supremely satisfying and glorious. That's first thing. Number two,
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.280]   that we would not crave the praise of man because God himself is not enough for us,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   which is what craving signifies. And you can taste it when somebody's angling and craving for other
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   peoples to approve what they're doing. And three, that we would avoid ways of showing our piety
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:02.320]   or showing good deeds which aim at getting praise from other people. Now that's tricky. I don't
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:10.640]   presume to say that's black and white always, but that's our aim. And four, that we should genuinely
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.720]   love people, which means both doing good things to help them practically, materially, temporally,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.840]   and passionately desiring through those good things that they would come to worship God and
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.400]   give glory to him. Now that doesn't answer all the questions of what we're supposed to do with
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:40.000]   our Twitter accounts or our Instagram or our camera or our video or our blog. It doesn't
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.400]   answer every question, but it does set up significant checks and fill us—I hope,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:57.520]   this is what I long for anyway—fill us with spiritual desires, not vain egoistic desires.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.800]   Let me say one other thing. I just got to tack this on here from Matthew 5 for Stephen and others
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:13.520]   to consider. Read the flow. Go back and read the flow of thought from Matthew 5, 11 to 16—not
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:23.200]   just 14 to 16, but 11 to 16—and notice that the salt of the earth and the light of the world are
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:32.240]   very likely not just good deeds in the abstract that people can see, but rather they are good
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:41.120]   deeds done in the face of disapproval, criticism, and persecution mentioned in verses 11 and 12,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.760]   so that the saltiness of the salt and the brightness of the light is not good deeds in
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.520]   the abstract, which lots of unbelievers do, but the deeds done joyfully for Christ's sake in the
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:04.160]   face of opposition and persecution. That is what tastes salty and appears bright and causes people
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.600]   to glorify God, not just our good deeds.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.320]   - That's so, so good. Thank you, Pastor John. And we've talked a lot about social media and
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.720]   smartphone habits over the years on this podcast, and especially during a season when I was
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.800]   researching and doing some interviews for my book on 12 Ways Our Phones Are Changing Us.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.000]   You can find many of those interviews in the nearly 1,200 episodes now in our growing archive.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.800]   And you can subscribe to our audio feeds, and you can find those past episodes in that archive,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.080]   even reach us by email with a question of your own, even questions about something John Piper
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.760]   may have shared on social media. You can do all that through our online home at
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.920]   DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. Well, we now break for the weekend. On Monday, we're going to be
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.520]   back to count the cost of following Christ. Jesus tells us to estimate the cost of following Him
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:58.160]   before we start following Him. So how on earth do we calculate the cost to begin with? It's another
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.040]   Sharp question from another Sharp podcast listener, because we have thousands of Sharp
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   podcast listeners around the world listening and engaging with us and sending us great questions.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.600]   Thanks for listening and participating in this community. I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.480]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:12.960]   [END]
