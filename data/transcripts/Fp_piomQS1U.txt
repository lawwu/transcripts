[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.400]   the book of Exodus, in chapter 33, reading verse 17. The 17th verse in the 33rd chapter
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   of the book of Exodus, "And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.120]   thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name." Those
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.520]   who attend here regularly will know that we have been examining this great and important
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.120]   33rd chapter of the book of Exodus for a number of Sunday mornings, as it gives us a picture
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:52.300]   and an illustration of the Church in her impotence and weakness, praying to God for some unusual
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.640]   manifestation of his presence, his glory, and his power.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.560]   Now, we have been doing that because it is a kind of pattern and norm of what the Church
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:17.320]   has done so frequently in other days and ages and generations. And we are looking at all
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.720]   this, of course, because of the situation in which we find ourselves today. Well, now
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   we come to this particular verse because, having considered what Moses prayed for, and
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.200]   why he prayed for it, and how he prayed for it, we come now to God, hearing Moses and
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   giving him an answer, and promising him that he will do this very thing for him and for
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   the children of Israel which had thus been requested. So our subject is God having pity
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.700]   and mercy upon the Church and sending his blessing.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.200]   Now this is with Sunday morning, but you see there is no need for us to interrupt our series
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.240]   because this day of all days is very much at the centre of the very thing that we are
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:27.040]   considering together. For revival, after all, is nothing but God hearing the people and
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.180]   having mercy upon them and answering them by giving this manifestation of his glory
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.560]   and his strength and his power. That is really what revival means. And it is important, therefore,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   for us to understand it and to know something of what adenorate we should be anticipating
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.560]   and what we should be seeking in our prayers. And, of course, there is no doubt at all about
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.720]   this, the way to discover that is to go back to this second chapter of the book of the
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   Acts of the Apostles. It is a truism to say that every revival of religion that the Church
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   has ever known has been, in a sense, a kind of repetition of what happened on the day
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:29.480]   of Pentecost. It has been a return to that origin, to that beginning. It has been a reviving.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.460]   Well, there is a great deal, it seems to me, of very loose and dangerous talk and writing
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.200]   about what happened on the day of Pentecost. People go on repeating one after another that
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.480]   what happened on the day of Pentecost was once and for all and forever, never to be
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.280]   repeated. Now, it is important that we should examine that, because if that is really true,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.000]   well then it is very wrong to pray for revival. Very wrong indeed. But, of course, it just
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   is not true. There is only one sense in which what happened on the day of Pentecost cannot
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:17.000]   be repeated, and that is simply this, that it did happen to be the first of a series.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.840]   Of course, you cannot repeat the first, but the fact that you cannot repeat the first
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.400]   does not mean for a moment that what happened on the first occasion cannot happen again.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.280]   And every revival of religion, I say, is really a repetition of what happened on the day of
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.320]   Pentecost. Now, it is really almost incredible that people should go on saying this, that
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.840]   what happened on Pentecost was once and for all, never repeated. Because if you go to
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.660]   the eleventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and look there at Peter making
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.000]   his defense for having baptized Cornelius and his household, they being Gentiles, you
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.280]   will remember that what Peter said was something like this. I will start reading, if you like,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.760]   at verse twelve. He said, "And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.880]   these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the men's house," that is to
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.840]   say, Cornelius' household. "And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.280]   Peter, who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. And as I
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:44.240]   began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning." You notice what
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:53.680]   he says. The Apostle says that the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and his household as on
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   us at the beginning. He said the same thing happened to them as happened to us on the
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.840]   day of Pentecost. Then he goes on to say this, "Then remembered I the word of the Lord,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.120]   how that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.160]   Ghost." What he means is this. He says, "I remembered that John had said that this
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.800]   baptism with the Holy Ghost was going to come. It had happened to us on the day of Pentecost.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.880]   I now saw that it was happening to these people." In other words, the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   took place on the day of Pentecost, but it also took place later upon Cornelius and his
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   household. That is exactly Peter's argument. "But then I remembered the word of the Lord,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:49.200]   how he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.720]   For as much then as God gave them the like gift," the same gift you see, "as he did
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could withstand God?"
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.340]   And he repeats the same argument again on a later occasion. Now then, I do trust we
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:17.040]   are clear about this, and that we really must cease to say that what happened on the day
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.160]   of Pentecost happened once and for all. It did not. It was simply the first of a series.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.480]   I am ready to admit you cannot repeat the first, but that is nothing. What matters is
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.080]   the thing that happened. And the thing that happened happened later in exactly the same
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.400]   way. While Peter was preaching to Cornelius and his household, the Holy Ghost fell upon
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.480]   them as he had fallen upon these people in the upper room there on the day of Pentecost
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:59.360]   at Jerusalem. And of course, my argument is that that is exactly what happens in every
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.120]   revival. There is indeed even further evidence which I can adduce for you. You will find
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.360]   that the same thing even happened a few days after the day of Pentecost to the apostles
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.680]   and others. In Acts chapter 4 you will find it. There they went back after they had been
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.600]   prohibited to preach any longer in the name of Jesus Christ, and they all prayed together.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.680]   And we are told in verse 31, "And when they prayed, the place was shaken where they
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.920]   were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost." That is exactly
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.440]   the term used in the second chapter. The term "baptism" is not used in the second
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.800]   chapter, but it means the baptism. Our Lord had said, "Tarry ye in Jerusalem; you shall
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   be baptized not many days hence." So what happened on the day of Pentecost was the baptism
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.520]   of the Holy Ghost. It is described in these words. They were all filled with the Holy
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.560]   Ghost. But here they were filled again with the Holy Ghost. It was not anything that they
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   did, it was that which happened to them. All they did was to pray, then God poured out
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.640]   his Spirit upon them again and filled them until they were overflowing. They were filled
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.720]   with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. Now that is precisely
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:25.040]   what happens in revival. It is God pouring forth his Spirit, filling his people again.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.360]   It is not the thing that is talked of in Ephesians 5.18, which is a command to us, "Go on being
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.640]   filled with the Spirit." That is something you and I do. But this is something that is
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.600]   done to us. It is the Spirit falling upon us, being poured out upon us. These are the
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.520]   terms. "I will pour forth my Spirit." God alone can do that, but it is you and I who
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.440]   are responsible for going on being filled with the Spirit. We must not grieve the Spirit.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.520]   We must not quench the Spirit. We must give obedience to the Spirit. And as long as we
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.880]   do that, we shall go on being filled with the Spirit. This is different. This is the
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:08.800]   Spirit being poured upon us until we are filled to overflowing. "Shed forth." These are the
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.760]   terms. But so much of the modern teaching never uses these scriptural terms at all.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.240]   You never find them talking or writing about the Spirit being poured forth or shed forth.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.160]   Never mentioned. No, because of this theory, you see, that what happened on the day of
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.440]   Pentecost happened once and for all. There is not a word in Scripture to say that. Indeed,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   as I have shown you, the Scripture says quite plainly and clearly and explicitly the exact
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:47.800]   opposite. The Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. My dear friends, let
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.560]   us be careful that we do not quench the Spirit in the interest of some theory or in a fear
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.160]   of certain freak religious bodies. Very well then, having cleared that point, let us go
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.280]   on to consider what happens when this takes place.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:16.640]   What is revival, says somebody? Why are you concerned about this? Why do you go on urging
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:26.720]   us to pray for this? The answer is that this above everything else is what is needed today.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:36.780]   When will the Christian church come to realize this? The church, and mark you this feast
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:45.040]   of Pentecost, this Whitsun Tide, is in particular the festival of the church. Oh, is there any
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.560]   tragedy comparable to this? The failure of the church to realize that this is her need
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:59.040]   and that this is her only hope. But you know, the church does not realize it. We are in
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.240]   the month of May. It is the month for the May meetings, annual assemblies of all the
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.600]   great denominations and their meetings. What are they doing? Have you been reading the
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.760]   reports? If it were not tragic, it would be laughable, because this is what they are doing.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.400]   They are investigating the situation, the problem confronting the church. There are
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:30.600]   the facts, they say. Now then, what are we to do? And what have they done? Has there
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:38.960]   been a great call to prayer and fasting, to humiliation, and to a crying out to God to
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.040]   have mercy and to baptize us afresh with the Holy Ghost? Has it been that? No, I think
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   what you will find is this. They have appointed special commissions. In one case, they have
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.720]   appointed eight special commissions to inquire into the situation. I say, if it were not
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   tragic, it indeed would be most laughable. Setting up committees to investigate. Of course,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.000]   that is what the politicians do, I know. That is what a businessman does, and in those realms
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.880]   it is absolutely right. It is the obvious, common sense thing to do. But in the name
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.960]   of God, I ask, isn't it tragic that the Christian church should be doing that? With
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:32.220]   the world as it is today, commissions to investigate, commissions of inquiry, and indeed one commission
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:39.080]   even to report as to what the Christian faith really is and how it is to be expressed. With
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:46.620]   the world on fire, with hell let loose, the Christian church is trying to discover what
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:54.960]   her message is. She is seeking for some way of meeting the situation. Commissions of investigation.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:01.180]   It is true of all sections of the Christian church. They are all in exactly the same condition.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:07.740]   Not a word about the need for this power, not a call to prayer and to humiliation and
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:16.840]   to agony in the presence of God. The church does everything except that which
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:23.740]   the Lord himself commended the early church to do. Ah, but the church says, you know,
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:29.820]   the conditions are different now. This is twentieth century. Oh, I am not going to insult
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:36.740]   you by keeping you with an answer to that. The twentieth century has nothing to do with
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:45.420]   the situation at all. Man in sin does not change. The world has always said that, and
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.140]   the church has always mentioned this change, this difference. My friends, we are talking
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:57.220]   about the power of God. And when we are talking about the power of God, to talk of superficial
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:04.540]   changes in men is not only an irrelevance, it is to be nonsensical.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:10.440]   The world, I say, has always been the same. Look at the position here in the book of Acts
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:17.360]   of the Apostles. Can you imagine any more hopeless position than that? Here is just
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.080]   a handful of people, and they are very ordinary men, where they are described later as illiterate
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.440]   and ignorant men. The Lord of glory goes back to heaven, and he leaves his cause and his
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.040]   interest in the hands of these men, fishermen and people like that. The Jews were all against
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:40.080]   them, as they had been against him. The Gentiles were all pagans. Now there is the position,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:47.280]   a handful of people in an entirely hostile and gainsaying world. I say nothing could
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.640]   have been worse than that, nothing could have been more difficult. But you remember what
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:00.920]   happened, don't you? When the Holy Ghost came down upon them, they were like lions,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:08.040]   mighty in power. And very soon they began turning the world upside down. And within
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:14.600]   three centuries, this little sect became the official religion of the great Roman Empire.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.920]   How did it happen? Did they hold commissions of inquiry and investigation? Nonsense. They
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:29.520]   just went on praying, waiting for the promise, the gift of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.720]   And so it has been. I again could take you over the history. Wasn't it like that at
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.520]   the Protestant Reformation? What hope had that one man, Martin Luther, just a monk and
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.720]   an unknown monk, who is he, to stand up against all the Church? And fifteen centuries, almost
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.320]   at least, a good twelve to thirteen centuries of tradition in the opposite direction. It
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.080]   seems a sheer impertinence. This one man gets up and says, "I alone am right, and you
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:02.960]   are all wrong." That is what will be said about him today. And yet, you see, he was
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.400]   a man with whom the Spirit of God had been dealing. And though he was only one man, he
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.520]   stood and stood alone, and the Holy Ghost honored him. And the Protestant Reformation
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.040]   came in and has continued. Well, there it is, I say. It has always been the same.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.400]   Well, now then, the question, therefore, for us to look at hurriedly this morning is this.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.520]   What happens now, then, when God does hear the cry and the plea and sends forth his blessing?
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:38.960]   Well, now, here it is, I say. Here is the pattern. The details may differ. They do differ.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.680]   While all revivals, in a sense, are identical, there are always minor differences. The big
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.720]   thing is always the same, but there are individual differences and variations which do not matter.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.680]   It is the central big things that matter. What happens to the Church, first of all,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:02.120]   when God hears the cry and begins to answer? Well, the first thing, clearly, is this. The
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:11.960]   Church becomes conscious of a presence and a power in her midst.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.320]   When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:24.360]   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.860]   all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:38.640]   as a fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:46.040]   and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utters. Consciousness of
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:56.800]   a power and of a presence. Sometimes it may be physical, even as it was here, the sound
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:05.480]   of a mighty rushing wind. It is not always physical, but it has often been in revivals.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.020]   You read the stories and the accounts. It does not matter who writes them. They will
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:15.940]   all testify to these things. But what they are all always conscious of is sudden awareness
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:22.580]   of a glorious presence in the midst, such as they have never known before, and a sense
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:35.920]   of power and a sense of glory. This place was filled, and so, I say, it always happens.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:45.140]   It may be accompanied by phenomena as it was here, cloven tongues as a fire, speaking with
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:54.700]   tongues. These things are not repeated always, sometimes, and sometimes not. Sometimes this
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.820]   sense of power and of glory is so great that people are prostrated to the ground because
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.620]   of the glory. As you hear of people when they suddenly get a good bit of news which they
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:11.260]   had not expected, they faint, literally faint, because of the wonderful news. So, when men
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:17.420]   and women experience this glorious presence, sometimes it is too much even for the physical
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:24.260]   frame. Well, we must not stay with these things, but that is the great thing to emphasize.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:38.620]   Is this sense of God, the presence and the presidency of the Holy Ghost? You read the
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:45.500]   books. Read this reprint of this book by Smeaton on revivals, and there you will find it. Men
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.900]   give their testimonies at the end. Great men in the church give an account of how they
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:56.140]   had passed through periods of revival in the church, and you will find that. You see, it
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.260]   is not any longer that they merely believe in God. God becomes a reality. God has come
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:08.740]   down, as it were, into their midst. And the meeting is taken out of the hands of whoever
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:16.380]   may have been in charge, and the Holy Ghost begins to preside, takes charge, and everybody
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.820]   is aware of his presence and of his glory and of his power. That is what happened on
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:28.420]   the day of Pentecost. That is what happens, I say, in some measure and to some extent
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.540]   in every revival that the church has ever known.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:39.340]   But let me hurry to a second thing. The church has given us the result of this great assurance
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.300]   concerning the truth. She does not have to investigate the truth, set up a commission
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:52.320]   to look into it. She is given an absolute certainty about it. That is the thing that
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:59.500]   comes out so clearly in this story. Now take these men, these apostles. You remember how
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.780]   a few weeks before, after the crucifixion, they had been very shaken. They had been most
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:13.140]   uncertain. They had come to a belief in the Lord Jesus Christ, and they had come to see
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.540]   that he was the Messiah. But then he was crucified, and they were shattered. They did not know
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.500]   where they were. You will find in the last chapter of the Gospel, according to St. John,
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.980]   they were just there talking to one another, and Peter suddenly said, "Well, I am going
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.820]   to fish. I must do something to relieve this. It is too miserable. It is impossible. I go
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.480]   fishing." And the other said, "Very well, we will come with you." You cannot imagine
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:41.620]   a more dejected picture. They were shaken. They were uncertain about everything. Well,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.260]   then the Lord appeared to them, and he taught them. Ah, yes, and they were in a better condition.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.980]   But you know, it was only after this which happened to them on the day of Pentecost that
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.340]   they were filled with an assurance and with an understanding, and they began to speak
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:02.580]   to the people about the wonderful works of God. Never again was there any doubt. Never
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:10.380]   again was there any difficulty about understanding. Take this man, Peter. Look at that sermon
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.500]   which he preached on that occasion. You see him expounding the Old Testament, showing
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.540]   the meaning of Joel's prophecy. He has got an understanding which he had never had before.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.620]   Our Lord had taken them through these scriptures, but they had not seen it clearly. But at last
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:31.860]   he has got it. And here he is with his mind illuminated, his heart moved, and he is speaking
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:40.300]   and expounding and explaining in this extraordinary sermon. Well, this is again something that
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:49.700]   is quite invariable in revival. People have no doubt about these things at such times.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:55.780]   They know, they know. That is what they testify to. This is what they say. They say, "I
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.100]   had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ for years, and yet I was assailed by doubt. But
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:09.820]   from that moment I knew. He told me that he loved me, and that he had given himself for
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:17.540]   me." Their testimony is that they are more certain of him and of God and of the spiritual
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:24.140]   realm than they are of anything else. That is what happens. There is an immediacy, there
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:30.620]   is a directness. It is no longer indirectly, as it were, by faith. These things are brought
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:39.180]   in a most real way before them, and they are absolutely certain and assured. Now that is,
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.940]   I say, something again that is quite universal in experience.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:54.460]   The next thing I notice is that the church is filled with great joy and a sense of praise.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.860]   Did you notice the terms there towards the end of the chapter? "And they, continuing
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.780]   daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:14.780]   with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favour with all the people."
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:22.020]   You know that is how the Christian church is meant to be. Great joy, great praise to
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.300]   the Lord Jesus Christ and to God, glorying in this great salvation in the new life they
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   had received and in this sense of heaven. Well, it is again but the simple pattern of
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:44.140]   what has been repeated so frequently when God has again poured out his Spirit upon the
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:50.900]   church, when the Holy Ghost has fallen again. I have often quoted from this pulpit a thing
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.220]   I remember reading in the journals of George Whitefield, how he was preaching on one occasion
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:04.540]   in Cheltenham and he said, "Suddenly the Lord came down amongst us." Do you know anything
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:10.780]   about that, my friend? Do you believe in that sort of thing? Do you believe that is possible?
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.100]   Now George Whitefield at his worst was probably the greatest preacher that this country has
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.620]   ever known, but there were variations you see even in the ministry of George Whitefield.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.460]   There he was preaching in Cheltenham, having a very good service, but suddenly he said,
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:34.940]   "The Lord came down amongst us." That is the thing. And it resulted in great joy,
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.140]   praise and thanksgiving. You know when the church is in a state of revival, you do not
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:49.060]   have to exhort people to praise, you cannot stop them. They are so filled with joy. Their
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:56.180]   very faces shine, they are transfigured. There is a heavenly look that even comes upon their
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:05.580]   very faces, which is expressive of this joy, this praise. Can you not see, my dear friends,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.980]   that this is the need of the church today? The people are outside. Why are they outside?
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:19.220]   They say, "Well, it is because I know you miserable Christians." They give the impression
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:26.860]   that they are much happier than we are. But when the Holy Ghost has fallen, people are
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:33.340]   filled with this joy. It is not a superficial, carnal, put-on thing. It is a thing that comes
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:40.240]   from within, the power of the Spirit irradiating the whole personality and giving a joy which
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.900]   is unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.420]   And then, of course, the other thing I must emphasize is this element of worship and of
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:57.620]   thanksgiving with great freedom. We read that "they continued steadfastly in the apostles'
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:04.020]   doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and prayers, and all that believed were
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:10.680]   together and they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.600]   house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:24.060]   having favour with all the people." Worship, thanksgiving. Have you read the stories of
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.340]   revivals? This is what you will find. Once this happens, you see, you do not have to
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.420]   exhort people to come together to worship and to praise and to consider the Word. They
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.380]   insist upon it. They come night after night and they may stay hours until the early hours
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.580]   of the morning. It will go on night after night for months, exactly as they did here
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.860]   at the beginning. They met daily. They could not keep away from one another. Of course
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.360]   not. This marvellous thing had happened, this joy of the Lord, and they wanted to thank
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.860]   him together and to pray together, to ask him to spread it and to do it to others. This
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:03.060]   worship and thanksgiving and praise, you know, if this happens to the Church, the world outside
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:11.000]   will be astonished. It will be amazed, as it always has been, in every period of revival
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.820]   and reawakening. This is what is needed, not to exhort to doubtful worldly methods to try
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.700]   and get crowds and bring people together. No, no. This inward urge, this constraint
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:27.340]   of the Spirit, this coming together of men and women who are sharing in the same glorious
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.780]   experience. And then the last thing I would notice this morning about what happens to
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:41.380]   the Church is the power and the boldness that is given in the proclamation of the truth.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:48.300]   Look at this man, Peter. It is but a few weeks before that he was so fearful and so much
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.380]   the victim of a craven spirit that he even denied the Lord Jesus Christ to that servant
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:30:00.980]   maid in order to save his life. Here he is now preaching in Jerusalem. He knows the authorities
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:07.220]   are watching him and listening to him. And he tells them quite plainly and in no uncertain
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.780]   language what they have done in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "Him being
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.780]   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God you have taken, and by
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:25.000]   wicked hens have crucified and slain." He repeated it again. You will find the account
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.220]   in the next chapter. Here he is speaking again to the same people. He says, "The God of
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:36.380]   Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus,
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.260]   whom you delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:47.140]   to let him go. But ye denied the Holy One and the just, and desired a murderer to be
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:53.740]   granted unto you, and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.540]   He attacked them and their rulers and governors. He is not afraid of them any longer, nor of
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.220]   the whole world. Let hell be let loose. He is filled with a holy boldness, and he bears
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:10.220]   witness to the resurrection, and proclaims the truth of God without fear and without
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:21.020]   favour." And again, that is invariable in the history of revival. That is what happens
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:26.900]   to the whole Church. That is what happens to individuals. You are all interested in
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.400]   D. L. Moody. Well, that is what he said. He said that after his experience of thus having
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:38.260]   the Holy Ghost shed forth upon him, this baptism with the Spirit, he said, "I went on preaching
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.740]   the same old sermons as I had been preaching before." But he said, "They were absolutely
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:48.060]   different." And they were, and they were different in their results. The same sermons,
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.780]   and yet they were not the same sermons. There was this demonstration of the Spirit and of
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.820]   power. It is the same with all others. Well, now, then, there are the things that
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.380]   happen to the Church at such a time. Let me say just a word before I close about what
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:08.660]   happens to the world that is outside. The Church, experiencing this, you see, is now
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   concerned about the world outside. So it prays for the world outside. It preaches to the
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.140]   world outside. It is concerned about it. And what happens? Well, the first thing we are
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:24.500]   told is that the world outside becomes attracted by curiosity. "And there were dwelling at
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.140]   Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation, and are hidden." Now, when this was noised
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded. A great crowd gathered. They said,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:44.820]   "What's this?" You see, the problem confronting the Church today is, what can we do with these
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.900]   masses that are outside the Church? And you see, their way of solving it is, let us set
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.060]   up commissions to investigate. We will have a commission to investigate what we are to
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.820]   preach to them. Then we will have another commission to investigate how we are to preach
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   the problem of communication they call it. This problem of communication. How can we
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.980]   get people to listen, as if there had never been a problem of communication until this
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.820]   generation? But it has always been there. It was there at the beginning. What are we
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.580]   to do about these masses? How can we get them together? What can we do? Can we put on some
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   sort of show to attract them? Can we put on something bright and gay? And can we sort
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.820]   of start, as I once heard in a conference, they started with comic songs and then they
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:33.460]   became a little bit more serious until eventually they came to hymns. Is that the method? My
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:41.900]   dear friends, if you want to get a crowd in your churches, pray for revival. Because the
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.260]   moment a revival breaks out, the crowd will come. And I'll tell you another thing, it
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:53.100]   won't cost you a penny. I'm speaking to the church that is spending thousands of
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:34:01.020]   pounds on advertising. Advertising to try and attract the outsider. The moment you get
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.700]   revival, the newspapers will report it. Their motive, of course, will be quite wrong. They
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.300]   will do it because they don't like it, because they think it's ridiculous, because they
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.900]   think that people have gone mad or that they're drunk. Doesn't matter. They'll give it
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.460]   a free advertisement. And the crowds will come to see what's happening, as they did
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:27.740]   on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. The crowd gathered together. Oh, what fools we
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:36.940]   are. It's our cleverness that's our undoing, you know. We think we can do it. When will
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:44.380]   we wake up to realize we cannot? But that the Holy Ghost can. He even does that part
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:51.020]   of it for us. And then they came along, of course, as I say, skeptical and contemptuous.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.660]   These men are full of new wine, that's the trouble with these. But Peter stood up and
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:00.500]   said, "These men are not drunk as you suppose. Seeing it is but the third hour of the day,
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.620]   use your common sense." He says, "How can they be drunk at this hour of the day, apart
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.820]   from anything else?" But he says, "That's a negative. The positive thing is this. This
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:14.720]   is that which was spoken by the prophet John." And he began to preach. And here he is going
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.620]   on with his sermon. "Men and brethren," he says in his application, "let me speak
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:26.460]   freely unto you of the patriarch David." And on he goes with his sermon. "Therefore,"
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.100]   he says, "let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:44.740]   whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ." Then listen. "Now when they heard this, they
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.380]   were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Men
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:56.740]   and brethren, what shall we do?'" You see, Peter hadn't arrived at the end of the sermon.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.060]   He hadn't finished. Before he'd arrived at the end of the sermon, they cried out.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.060]   He didn't finish his sermon and then have a hymn and say, "Now we come to the appeal,"
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.260]   and try to get them to come forward. Not at all. Before he'd finished preaching, they
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.660]   were crying out and saying, "What shall we do?" There was no need to test the meeting.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   The Holy Ghost had done it. People were so deeply convicted of sin, so humbled and broken
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.900]   and alarmed and terrified, that they interrupt the sermon and cry out, saying, "Men and
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.780]   brethren, what shall we do?" They're in an agony of soul, this profound conviction
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:37.980]   of sin. That's the story of every revival. There is always that kind of interruption,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:44.940]   almost a disorder, what somebody called a divine disorder. And then, of course, that
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:52.380]   in turn, you see, leads to repentance. "Oh," says Peter, "repent and be baptized, every
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.020]   one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins." And they
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.980]   did. It isn't a mere question of decision when you have a revival. It's deep repentance.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:10.860]   It's reformation. They receive a new life and they leave the old life. You know, when
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.540]   you get a revival, the whole neighborhood is changed. Public houses are shut. The moral
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.020]   conditions are revolutionized. Read the stories. These are facts. This isn't my idea. This
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:30.340]   isn't theory. I'm speaking factual matter. The statistics are there. The whole moral
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:36.700]   condition is changed. When you get revival, when the Holy Spirit is doing his own work,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.300]   not only do individuals give up drink and so on, public houses are shut. Men's businesses
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.540]   are ruined. There was actually a case in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago of a publican
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.420]   who himself was converted. He went to the meeting because all his customers had left
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:57.060]   him. There was nobody to serve in his public house. So he went and said, "What is this
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:04.260]   nonsense?" And there he was converted himself. And he became a preacher of the gospel. That's
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:16.340]   a revival. A true heart repentance. A forsaking of sin. Newness of life manifesting itself
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:23.380]   in an entirely new department. And they joined the church. It was not a case of temporary
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.060]   decisions. They joined the church. They were added to the church. The churches were built
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:38.260]   up and they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.420]   and prayer. Do you know, as a result of the revival of a hundred years ago, the number
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.500]   of chapels that had to be built was quite phenomenal? I happen to know the facts concerning
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.340]   Wales. I've got to go and preach at a centenary of a building of a chapel in next September.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:59.820]   There are many others. They all had to be built because of so many being converted and
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:05.700]   joining the churches. Adding to the church from those who were entirely outside. Not
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.260]   that those who were already in the church were given some new fillip. No, no. The people
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:17.100]   who were outside came in, converted and changed, added to the church. I've already given you
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:25.900]   some of the statistics with respect to the various countries. And there you see is the
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.300]   very thing we are told the church needs today. Membership going down, Sunday schools going
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:39.500]   down, everything going down. Shutting chapels, trying to group them together. Therefore your
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:48.460]   commissions to do this and that, we want to get the people in. Here's the answer. Here's
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:58.980]   the infallible, the certain way. The falling down of the Holy Ghost upon the church. The
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:08.820]   shedding forth of the Spirit of God again. The church being given a new baptism of power
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:18.940]   and authority and ability to witness and to preach. Can more be said? Don't you see
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:25.980]   it all here? That's how God started the church. That is how God has continued to keep
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.700]   the church alive. When in the hands of men she has almost died so often, God has again
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:39.180]   done this selfsame thing. He's repeated his original action. And the Moribund church
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:48.500]   has risen to a new period of life and activity and power. Isn't this the supreme need at
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:56.580]   this hour? Well, if you believe that, pray to God without ceasing. Go on with all your
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.860]   activities if you like. Go on with your work. I'm not saying that you should stop doing
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.780]   everything and just wait. No, no. Go on if you like doing all you're doing. But I do
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:11.900]   say this. Make certain that you leave time to pray for revival and to see that that has
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:22.300]   more time than anything else. Because when the Holy Ghost falls, more happens in an hour
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.620]   than will happen as a result of your exertions and mine in fifty years or even a hundred
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:33.900]   years. The power of the Holy Ghost. That's the meaning of the day of Pentecost. That's
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:42.620]   the meaning of Whitsun. The power of God coming down. And in such a manner that the apostles
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.460]   were amazed even as Peter was, you see, in preaching to the household of Cornelius. There
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.380]   he was again halfway through his sermon. Down came the Holy Ghost and Peter could scarcely
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.940]   believe it. He didn't believe that Gentiles could come in. He'd argued when he'd been
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.220]   given the vision on the housetop, you remember. He couldn't believe it. But he said, "When
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.180]   I saw that God had done to them what he did to us at the beginning, who was I that I could
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:17.100]   refuse to baptize them?" Pray God to have pity and to have mercy and to shed forth again
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:23.140]   his blessed Holy Spirit upon us. Amen.
