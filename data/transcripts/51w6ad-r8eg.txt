[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So I'm gonna give a mouse now, sugar versus water.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.900]   very little from the water.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.080]   Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   Mouse can no longer tell them apart
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.460]   and they will drink from both.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.040]   But if I keep the mouse in that cage for the next 48 hours,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.800]   something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.600]   and I see what the mouse is leaking or drinking from.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.720]   That mouse is drinking almost exclusively
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.920]   from the sugar bottle.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   How could this be?
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.240]   He cannot taste it, doesn't have sweet receptors.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.920]   During those 48 hours, the mouse learn
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.600]   that there is something in that bottle
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180]   that makes me feel good.
