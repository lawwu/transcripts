[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   If you and I were able to go into Skyrim, right,
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.520]   and walk around and live together, would we make love?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.760]   - No, no, no, no, man, don't go there.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.040]   - Okay. - No, no, no, no,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.600]   because we like girls, man.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.520]   - The following is a conversation with Bobby Lee,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.560]   a standup comedian and podcaster
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.160]   and one of the funniest humans on the planet,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280]   and just someone who brings joy to my heart
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.720]   with a mix of non-sequitur absurdity, darkness,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.440]   and the singing voice of an angel.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.520]   In all seriousness, Bobby's just a beautiful human being.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.280]   I've been a fan of his for 20 years,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040]   since his time on "MADtv" to today
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.840]   with his podcast "Tiger Belly"
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.240]   that he does with his other half,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.360]   the love of his life, Kalilah,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.920]   and the podcast "Bad Friends"
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.600]   that he does with Andrew Centino.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.880]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.160]   in the description.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160]   And now, dear friends, here's Bobby Lee.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.880]   I've been a fan of yours for many, many years.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.640]   I think you're one of the funniest people in the world.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.520]   I've been a fan since "MADtv" days 20 years ago
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.440]   (laughing)
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.240]   to today with "Tiger Belly."
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.600]   So given that, given your status as a world-class comedian,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.640]   how did it feel that you were not invited
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.020]   to Andrew Schultz's wedding and I was?
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.760]   - What, you were there?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.320]   - Yeah, I was there.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   I was the least funny person there.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480]   And the whole time I was thinking,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.560]   isn't that funny that Bobby Lee's not here?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.400]   (laughing)
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.680]   - Yeah.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.120]   - All my life, I always felt like people didn't like me
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.560]   and they didn't wanna invite me to things.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.540]   I think that's fundamentally the reason why I do what I do.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.000]   So it really did hurt a lot.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.680]   And I had resentments.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.320]   I did some revenge fantasies
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440]   about how I'm gonna get revenge on him and stuff.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.080]   - Yeah, on him specifically?
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.920]   - Him specifically.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.760]   - Okay.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.600]   - Like have a big wedding, invite everyone,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.560]   you know what I mean, except him, stuff like that.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.400]   - Yeah.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.360]   - And then just write him a letter like,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.960]   see, that's how it feels or whatever.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.600]   But instead of that, 'cause I'm in therapy and stuff,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000]   I'm just kinda like trying to let it go.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.920]   What'd you do there?
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   This right here, why'd you do that?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   - I forgot to start the timer.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.760]   And now it starts. - You wanna start over?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.600]   - Yeah, let's do this.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.560]   (laughing)
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.920]   Let's do it again.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   Take two.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.600]   No, you still feel like an outsider?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.280]   Your exception is successful, me, domain.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   You still feel?
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.120]   - Yeah.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   - I'm doing a Netflix show tonight with Andrew Santino
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.920]   at the Comedy Store and this and that,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.680]   but last night, I just felt like I wasn't a part of,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.760]   in fact, on stage I go, I even mention it,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.560]   I go, Netflix, they don't like me, you know what I mean?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.200]   And I just say things like that, they're not true.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.360]   And this is something that I wanna correct with myself
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.120]   because I have this internal dialogue
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.360]   that's based on just the past.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.720]   And 99% of the things that go on in my mind aren't true.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.560]   And I'm just at a point in my life
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   where I just don't wanna start,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.200]   I don't wanna live like that anymore.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.440]   - Really, 'cause I'm the same way,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.480]   I'm deeply self-critical all the time.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.320]   - Yeah.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.920]   - And that's kind of an engine that drives you to do stuff.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.320]   - Yeah, but it doesn't give you the kind of freedom
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.960]   that I would like.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.360]   Don't you wanna be truly free?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.040]   Free from your mind?
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720]   Free from negative thoughts?
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   - No, I'm free part of the day,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440]   but some of the day I spend being extremely self-critical
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   and that drives you,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   'cause I'm afraid I'll become ultra lazy otherwise.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.520]   'Cause I love life, I love being comfortable,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.720]   I love just relaxing, I need very few things in life,
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.440]   and so I'm afraid I'll just get super lazy.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   - Oh, are you a minimalist?
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.040]   - Yeah.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.880]   - So if I went to your house in Austin, do you have a couch?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.360]   - I recently got, this is the first couch I've gotten ever
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.200]   because the guests were complaining,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.720]   'cause I also record the podcast there.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.520]   The guests were complaining there's nowhere to sit.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   I have no chairs, no couch, I sleep on the floor,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.400]   like a mattress is on the floor.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.120]   Not out of principle, I think,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.280]   out of some kind of minimalist momentum.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.960]   - Minimalist, so we're the opposite in that way then.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.760]   - Oh, so you like stuff?
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.440]   - I'm not a hoarder, 'cause I can throw things away,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   but I have a shopping addiction, I think.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.400]   Like when I'm on the road,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   like I was in Oklahoma for two weeks,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.000]   I just bought a bunch of stuff, you know what I mean?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.720]   And then, oh my God, I went to Todd Snyder
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.800]   and I bought these shoes.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.400]   Because I--
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.360]   - But you're wearing them, so they're actually,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.880]   you're using them, and they're giving value to your life.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   That's awesome.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.880]   - Yeah, but this is the last time I'm gonna wear these.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   - This is the one time?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.960]   - This is like a wedding, but it's a red carpet dress.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.480]   Who's the designer, do you know?
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.320]   - I don't know anything about it.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.400]   - What are you wearing, Bobby?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.240]   - I don't know what I'm wearing,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.920]   but because I'm on a native show
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.560]   called Reservation Dogs, right?
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   I just wanna get into the spirit of things.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.760]   - That's your--
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.560]   - Yeah, this is, because if I was ever native
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.120]   and I was in a tribe back in the day,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   you know what I mean?
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.320]   I would've been a gatherer.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.080]   Yeah, I'm not a hunter.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'm gonna weave baskets with the ladies.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.440]   I wanna pick berries with the ladies.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.680]   - You wouldn't be the chieftain.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   - No, no, no.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.960]   And I would make, after the hunt,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.040]   I would probably make some,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.080]   so some of the guys make love to me.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.240]   - Oh.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.000]   - Yeah, because I'm gay, not just because, you know.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.840]   - Yeah, you have to.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   - I'm heeding the way.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.500]   Yeah, yeah, I want them to like me.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.340]   - There's a power hierarchy.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.160]   You gotta know your place in the hierarchy.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.560]   - Yeah, you're alpha male then.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.880]   - I don't even know what that means.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   - Joe Rogan.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.920]   - Joe Rogan is the definition of alpha male?
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.840]   - To me, yeah.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.360]   If there was a picture of alpha male in the dictionary,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.200]   it would be Joe Rogan.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.040]   - It would be Joe Rogan?
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.880]   - Yeah.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.240]   (laughing)
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.480]   So you hoard stuff, okay.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.160]   - But you can throw,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.000]   when was the last time,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.820]   let me call you out on that.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.040]   When was the last time you threw away
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.840]   something that's actually valuable?
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   - Valuable?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.920]   - Like something valuable to you or valuable in general.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.160]   - Most things that I buy aren't valuable to me.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.840]   There are things that are valuable to me
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.200]   that are like keepsakes for my family and stuff
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.120]   that I will keep forever.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.400]   So like in terms of like an old photo of my father
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   or whatnot, so those kind of things I keep.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.360]   But when it comes to like, you know,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.920]   Aviator Nation sweats,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   like if somebody came over to my house and goes,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.520]   "Hey, can I have six of those sweatshirts?"
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.920]   or whatever, I'd be like, "Yeah, go take it."
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.760]   - Okay.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.920]   - But if my brother's come over to my house
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.480]   and he's done a clearance, you know what I mean?
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.720]   Like I'm gonna take this, this, and this,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   I generally really don't have a problem with it.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.200]   - So the self-critical voice is serving no purpose
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.120]   in terms of, 'cause you're pretty, you know,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.960]   I'm a fan of yours,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.120]   so you're known to be a little bit lazy sometimes.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.080]   - 100% lazy.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.920]   - Yeah.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.680]   - So the self-critical voice,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.360]   don't you think that it's serving a purpose
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.000]   in fighting off the laziness,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.440]   beating off the laziness?
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.720]   - The self-critical voice that I have,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.480]   I've been able to compartment,
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.680]   how do you say it, compartment?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.000]   - Yeah, however you say it.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.080]   (laughing)
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.920]   You're free.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   Put it in a compartment, right?
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.640]   And I'm able to, I'm a good avoider.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.880]   I'm good at avoidance.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.440]   So for instance, right now, to avoid,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.380]   I've been playing Stardew Valley.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.080]   You know what that is?
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.680]   - No, it's a phone game or?
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.920]   - No, you can play it on your Switch,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.360]   but it's on the Xbox, and it's a farming simulation game.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.120]   And so I like to farm, you know what I mean?
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.380]   And so playing video games and doing stuff like that
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.720]   distracts me from what really is going on.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.440]   - Okay, you've mentioned elsewhere,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.600]   in terms of video games, Elder Scrolls.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.440]   - Yeah, did you play that?
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.600]   - Yeah, of course, it's probably my favorite game.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.180]   If I could live in a world,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.240]   you played Morrowind and Skyrim.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.360]   - I played Oblivion.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.200]   - Oblivion.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.280]   - I played a little bit of Morrowind,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.440]   but I didn't like the graphics back then,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.160]   but I really played the, can I swear on this podcast?
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.000]   - Yeah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.480]   - I played the fuck out of Oblivion and Skyrim.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.800]   Like eight character, I played it all the way through,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.440]   I have to do all the quests, that type of thing.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.740]   - What's your favorite thing about those games?
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.280]   Why did you spend so much time in that world?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.960]   - Because I like games that you can grind.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.500]   - What do you mean by grind?
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.280]   - So like Stardew Valley, for instance, right?
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.100]   There's a lot of--
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.940]   - Back to the farming simulation.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.760]   - Back to farming, right?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.560]   It's the same thing as Skyrim, the reason why I like it,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.800]   is that there's a lot of like,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.080]   I have to collect a lot of these things.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.440]   I have to just constantly pick things up.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.520]   Like for instance, in Skyrim,
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.820]   there's a mushroom called blisterwort mushroom
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.040]   that you can pick and then you can make it into
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.880]   some sort of formula, right?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.720]   A potion, right?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.600]   - Yeah, a potion, yep.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.480]   - So I would spend like literally human 12 hour days
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.860]   just going to every cave and picking up
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.920]   as much blisterwort as I could.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.000]   Like that kind of grinding.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.720]   - Yeah.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.760]   So you're actually the randomly generated quests
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.600]   that these games do, that's designed for people like you.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.840]   - You don't get bored, that's the fun.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.400]   - Yes, that's the fun for me.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.240]   - Okay.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.280]   - Yeah, there's always something to do.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.640]   And I find, like when you play a game that's linear,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.120]   like there's certain games where you have to go this way.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.940]   Right?
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.780]   I don't like games like that.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.120]   I like open world games where I can make choices
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.160]   and I can grind if I want.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.480]   - Would you stay in that world if you could live
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.680]   in that world, in the Elder Scrolls world?
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.660]   That's how I feel.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.560]   - In reality or become like an animated thing in there?
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.760]   - Oh no, say like virtual reality.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.840]   We're moving towards that direction.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.680]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.840]   - If you look at Skyrim, you mentioned graphics,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.240]   it's starting to get realistic.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.080]   - Yeah.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.520]   - Like I'll sometimes just walk around.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.360]   I mean, it's been a while,
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.080]   but I'll just walk around in Skyrim.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.920]   - Yeah.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.640]   - You can, there's code you can turn off enemies
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.880]   and you just walk around.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   - Really?
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   - You can just listen to music and just walk around.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.920]   - That's what you did?
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   - Yeah, I would do that.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.600]   When you do that, would you do it with me?
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.440]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.640]   - We would have a house together?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.480]   - Oh, I mean live.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.320]   I thought walk around.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.160]   - No, no, no.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.040]   If you and I were able to go into Skyrim, right?
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.840]   And walk around and live together.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.800]   - Would we make love?
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.160]   - No, no, no, no, man.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.080]   Don't go there.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.920]   - Okay.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.740]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.600]   Because we like girls, man.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.440]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.280]   - But it's not gay.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.480]   You told me it's not gay.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.600]   - All right, so you and I would--
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.920]   - Yeah, I would hunt, you would gather.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.280]   - But in that world--
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.480]   - Oh, there's no hunting.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.680]   - Yeah, there is hunting.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.400]   I would do, because we don't have to find a bandits.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.240]   We have to fight.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.600]   I'm not gonna gather a bandit.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.920]   I'm gonna hunt them.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.040]   - But I thought you said it's all about the potion.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   You don't need the bandits.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.880]   - Okay, well, we could do this.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.280]   You could be the guy that like defends our place, right?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.240]   I'll gather all the blister wart,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.480]   all the white caps, all the mushrooms.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.960]   I'll get all the food.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.620]   I'll go to Whiterun.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.460]   Remember Whiterun?
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.280]   - Yeah.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.120]   - Right, or Winterhold.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.880]   And I'll do all the like crusts
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.800]   that have nothing to do with, you know what I mean?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.000]   - So no dragons though?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.840]   No--
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   - No dragons, but we would have a banquet.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.680]   We'd invite the Dark Brotherhood.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   - Yeah.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.720]   - Right, the Fighter's Guild, we'd definitely invite them.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.240]   Mage's Guild, we'd invite them.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.680]   - Are you a thief kind of guy?
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.520]   - I'm a thief guy.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.800]   Yeah, I'm a thief guy for life.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.840]   Yeah, I'm a thief guy for life.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.600]   - And you still wouldn't invite Andrew Schultz to that?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.800]   - No, no, no.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.600]   But what a piece of shit though, huh?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.160]   Because let me just say something, okay?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.640]   I just wanna get back to that, okay?
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.480]   - Okay, sure.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.640]   - So I met him at the Montreal Comedy Festival
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.960]   and him and I are kindred souls.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.080]   We really connected.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.420]   - Yeah.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.360]   - And he did my podcast.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.320]   He's done it several times.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.160]   Done his.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.480]   We've like communicated on the phone, this and that.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.960]   And to me, and then he invites Whitney Cummings,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.600]   which Whitney is a good friend of mine.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.880]   But what I'm saying is that I know Andrew
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.920]   as well as Whitney knows him.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.640]   I don't think that Whitney knows him more than I do, right?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.080]   - What if it was a competition?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.480]   Like it was a tie, you know, like NBA,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.520]   like a Bobby Lee versus Whitney.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.920]   - Yeah.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   - In what way do you think she's better?
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.680]   In what way do you think you're better?
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.060]   - I think it's all about gender optics.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.040]   - Okay.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   - Right, so she's a comedian.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.480]   She has, he has all these alpha males coming
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.240]   and he's like, all right, I can, I have one more seat left.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.080]   - Yeah.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   - Whitney or Bobby, but Bobby is,
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.800]   although I don't think there was a lot of Koreans there.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.440]   So he could have used that card.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.280]   - This is true.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.200]   - Right, but I think he went for, you know,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.400]   Whitney's a woman, it's better for optics.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.600]   - Okay, so she was a diversity hire for the wedding.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.760]   - Yeah.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.600]   - I see.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.920]   It was pretty fun.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.720]   It was pretty, I have to say, I don't,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.960]   Joe Rogan.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.800]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.840]   - His wife.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.680]   - I get it.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.360]   - Yeah, and then Whitney.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.920]   - Are those the only comedians that were there?
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.240]   - I spent the whole time talking to Joe.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   So I think, no, I don't think there was that many comedians.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.480]   Some I'm kind of joking about.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.920]   It was a pretty, pretty small wedding.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.760]   - Yeah.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   - So yeah.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.520]   - What do you talk to Joe about?
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   - First of all, we're both grapplers.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.240]   So we talk a lot about jiu-jitsu.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.760]   We talk a lot about--
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.800]   - I'm a grappler.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.640]   - Are you?
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.800]   - I was on the wrestling team in high school.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.640]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   I know this.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.320]   - Is there a grappler that to you that,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   if I don't know jiu-jitsu,
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.520]   is there only one kind of grappling that you like?
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.680]   - Yeah, there's levels to this game, I think.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.760]   - Oh, I just talked out.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.080]   No, no, no, there's nothing more.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.920]   That's a surprising fact that you've dropped that.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.000]   It almost feels like a lie.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.400]   'Cause you've said that before that you were a wrestler
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.440]   in high school.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.280]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.440]   - Well, it's funny that you say that because,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.800]   and I'm gonna cause a little controversy here.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.320]   But Joe Rogan, one time came to me,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.880]   when he lived in LA, this is years ago,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.760]   and he said, "You're a liar.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.320]   "You've never grappled."
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.280]   And I go, "Yes, I did.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.340]   "You're a fucking liar.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.280]   "No, you didn't."
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.120]   And at that time, I didn't have any photos to prove it.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.480]   But if you look at my Instagram, I have photos.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.840]   That I was grappling.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.560]   - Of you as a young man dressed in a singlet or what?
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   - On the wrestling team.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.400]   - On the wrestling team.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.240]   - If you go to the fucking, sorry.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.640]   If you go to my, I'm sorry.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.960]   If you go to my fucking high school, you're right,
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.360]   I was on the wrestling team for three years.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.480]   - I'm not gonna go to your high school,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.520]   so is there actual photo evidence of you?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.080]   - Yeah, I wanna, you know what?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.400]   You're being like Rogan right now,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.520]   and it really is--
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.480]   - How do we know it's not Photoshopped?
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   - Oh, well, you be the judge then, dude.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.840]   Okay, so this is my brother and me
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.880]   in high school on the wrestling team.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.920]   - Which, oh, it's you are, yeah, you're on the--
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.200]   - I'm the bottom.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.720]   That's my brother to the left.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.240]   I mean, yeah, to your right.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.280]   - Oh, handsome.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.560]   - Yeah, I'm not, that's-- - Bicep.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400]   - Yeah.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.380]   - How much do you weigh?
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.220]   - Wow.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.280]   At the time I weighed, I was on the 105 weight category.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.080]   But, so I was also on the tennis team.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.280]   What people don't realize is that I'm very athletic.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.720]   - Okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.920]   And I resent the fact that people think that I'm not
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.840]   because I'm doughy.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.960]   - You're an athlete, so, which is very surprising to me.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.800]   - Why?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.200]   - That, so I was invited to the wedding.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.400]   - I've also been on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.560]   - He's a big fan of yours.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.480]   - No, I love Joe.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.040]   No, Joe, when Joe's, and I see Joe,
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.880]   we hug and stuff, we talk, I love him.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.120]   - I just talked to him today, said I'm talking to you.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.960]   This is hilarious.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.160]   - Why, oh, you hug him, you just never?
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.080]   - It just hasn't worked out.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.160]   Like, I don't wanna go like, hey,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.880]   'cause I don't want the rejection.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.360]   So, it's like, if I go, hey, can I do it?
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.680]   And he goes, I don't know, man, I'm busy, man.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.520]   I got a lot.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.400]   I mean, maybe later, I don't want that.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   So, if he said, hey, are you available Thursday this day,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.600]   fly out, do my podcast, I would 100% do it.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.800]   - And that hasn't happened yet.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.880]   - So interesting.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.840]   (laughing)
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.040]   - Why is it interesting?
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.480]   - I don't know, 'cause you're, like I said,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.800]   you're one of the funniest people in the world.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.920]   That'd be a great conversation.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.560]   It's just funny it hasn't happened yet.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.840]   - Well, it's like this conversation.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.560]   It's like, I just learned how to tell time.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.720]   - Yeah.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.120]   - Not like, I know how to write digital.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.560]   - You showed up on time today.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   - No, digital.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.000]   I know how to write digital, obviously,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.360]   but in terms of the hand clock,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.840]   I just learned that six months ago.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.920]   - How to operate a hand clock?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.200]   - To read a hand clock.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.040]   - Hand clock, okay.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.080]   - Not that I, obviously, I'll be able
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.200]   to absorb the information.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.400]   I'm one of those guys that just refuse
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.760]   to learn things if I just.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.480]   - What did you think it was before?
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.520]   - I would look at it, and I would try to sometimes,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.120]   like if I was at a train station,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.440]   and I would look at those old clocks,
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.080]   I would look at it and try to guess,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.240]   and I'd kinda go, I think this is the way,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.080]   you know what I mean?
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.760]   But not fully, you know what I mean, really grasp it.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.560]   - So the way ancient people looked up at the sun
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.920]   to try to tell time, you looked at a clock
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   to try to tell time.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.840]   - Right, like for instance, we don't look at the sun,
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.480]   so to me, it was an obsolete information to me,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   because I'm digital.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.600]   - You already had digital.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.120]   - And so that's somehow comparable to you
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.280]   going on the Joe Rogan.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.780]   - And you, because it's like, I don't know much about.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.560]   - Podcasting?
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.640]   - No, podcasting I can, but in terms of the singularity
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.000]   and all that stuff, I know what it is,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.200]   you know what I mean, when machines
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.660]   have consciousness, when is that gonna happen?
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.080]   - Soon, are you afraid of robots?
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.300]   See, if you were in Austin, I would show you some robots.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.140]   - Oh, I'd love to.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.920]   - Are you afraid of robots?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   - No, I love it.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.760]   - You love robots.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.480]   - Oh yeah, yeah, in fact, I have this,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.480]   I think to me, unless they become hostile
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.960]   and it becomes like the Terminator,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.200]   which I think could happen, right?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.760]   There'd be a Skynet, we'd have to bring it down,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.600]   whatever, but.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.640]   - There's definitely going to be autonomous weapon systems,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.400]   so a lot of the robotics research is being conducted,
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.720]   funded by the military.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.800]   - Wow.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   - You know, the military industrial complex?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.640]   - I know what that is, yes.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.480]   - Yeah, so a lot of the cutting edge research is done,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   is funded by DOD, Department of Defense, DARPA, and so on,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.100]   so a lot of the robots will be used in war,
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.680]   but hopefully not, most of consumer robotics
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.000]   will be in the home, I'm just trying to terrify you.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.120]   - No, no, no, but can I ask you this though?
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.520]   What you're saying to me is that, as a layperson,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   is that in my lifetime, that machines will have consciousness
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.120]   - Oh, that I don't know.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.940]   - Computers.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.520]   - I'm one of the people, well, depending,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.000]   you live dangerously, so I don't know
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.560]   how long you're gonna live.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.360]   So let's put, but I believe that consciousness, yes,
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.120]   could be engineered in a machine,
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.680]   or at least we can have machines that are human-like,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.320]   and we believe they have consciousness.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.800]   Can I ask you one last question about it?
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.640]   - Yes.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.800]   - But just one more.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.880]   - Will they have the smoothness of skin,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.640]   and will they look realistic?
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.380]   - See, I'm one of those people that believes
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.200]   that visual appearance isn't the magic.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.040]   So if you're blind, you can still have a connection
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.240]   with a person, people can fall in love with each other
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.000]   through just letters, so yeah, I know you're mocking me
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.800]   with your entire energy, but yes,
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.720]   yes, I believe that part too, you're talking about sex bots
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.400]   is what you're probably getting, okay, intimacy.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.000]   Just friends, friends, but you wanna feel the smoothness
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.840]   of their skin. - Yeah, like a guy,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.160]   like, you know, just go, "What's up, dude?"
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.000]   and just rub his face.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.840]   - Yeah, just hug and kiss,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.320]   and like, come both cheeks kind of thing.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.840]   - I get what you're saying, though, right?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.160]   Obviously, there's no soul, you're right,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.840]   you know what I mean, and I'm just curious to see,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   you're right, I was going with sex bots, but--
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.280]   - Yeah, yeah, have you seen Whitney Cummings' robot?
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.440]   - Yeah, I've seen it. - Okay.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.320]   - Yeah. - How did that make you feel?
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.880]   - She's a beautiful girl, I just don't find her attractive.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.080]   - The robot or Whitney?
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.040]   - I find the robot way more attractive.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.880]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.440]   - Yeah, if I had the choice, robot.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.000]   - So you were turned on by the robot.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.680]   See, I was surprised by the very thing you're saying,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.200]   which is the realism of the skit, like it was quite,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.000]   they did a really good job on that robot.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.840]   - Oh, they did?
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.160]   - The life, when it's animated, the life is not quite there,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.080]   you can tell it's a robot, but just sitting there still,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   it has a lot of human-like elements, the texture,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.720]   I don't know, it's quite fascinating.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.640]   - So they're getting there.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.900]   - They're getting there.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.480]   But the funny thing about sex robots
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.000]   is most people that get sex robots,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.280]   they don't get it for the sex, they get it for intimacy.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:05.120]   Not sexual intimacy, but just somebody being there.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.360]   It's the emotional connection, not the sexual.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.360]   - Yeah, I mean, I saw a long time ago a documentary
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.040]   about real dolls and people marrying them.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   Yeah, and what I was fascinated about is the cuddling,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.120]   you know what I mean, and then watching TV together
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.940]   and stuff like that, which I find,
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:32.040]   I've just been able to find human girlfriends and stuff.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.080]   - That's really impressive.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.440]   That's one of the reasons--
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   - Thanks, man, yeah, thanks, man.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.080]   - Speaking of human girlfriends,
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.380]   I'd love your advice in this direction,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.720]   but you have an amazing relationship with Kalilah.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.800]   So you two are very different,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.520]   so you host the Tiger Brother podcast together,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.840]   but there's real love there, there's a real connection.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.280]   What do you love most about Kalilah?
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.440]   Let's talk about love, Bobby Lee.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.600]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's a really pretty deep,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.760]   I've never really gone down this path.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.080]   - We're gonna walk down that path together holding hands.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.840]   - It's one of those things where the first time I met her,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.120]   it was almost as if I had known her all my life.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.200]   It was really weird, you know what I mean?
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.560]   There was a trust there, you know what I mean,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.600]   that was just fundamentally there,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.540]   that I could trust her and that I could, you know,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.200]   when I look in the mirror
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.520]   and I see all my character defects and stuff,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.280]   a lot of those things aren't necessarily things
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.560]   I wanna share with people
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.320]   because I don't wanna be judged or ridiculed,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.800]   but with her, I felt comfortable showing those things
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.120]   and I think she feels the same way about her.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   And then secondly, she's funny.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.600]   I mean, she made me laugh and she's hot.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   It's all, you know what I mean, the perfect,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.760]   it was like a perfect combination of things,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.040]   you know what I mean?
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.360]   One night we were in bed and I forgot what the joke was,
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.640]   but she really made me laugh one night.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.040]   She was living in an apartment in Long Beach
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.600]   and I cackled, you know what I mean?
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.320]   And generally, women don't make,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.920]   I mean, women I'm dating, comics do,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.960]   don't make me cackle in that way.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.760]   And then thirdly, she has,
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.920]   she's partly Asian.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.040]   So it's like, you know, one time I dated a white girl
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.720]   and I invited her to Koreatown.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.040]   - Are you about to be racist?
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.960]   - A little bit. - Okay.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.440]   And what I love about Asian girls
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   is they'll eat something first and ask what it is after,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.000]   but white girls ask what it is before.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.080]   What is this, right?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.960]   But Kalaya would eat the eyeball, eat everything,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.240]   go, what did I just eat?
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.560]   I like that, you know what I mean?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.280]   So it's like, and it reminds me of my mom in that way,
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.840]   in terms of like, my mom growing up just to scare us
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.960]   and freak us out, we'd have a fish
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.920]   and she would eat the eyeball first to see us squirm.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.480]   And as a kid, that you thought was gross
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.980]   and weird and this and that, but it's like,
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.120]   you know, when Kalaya does it, it just kind of like,
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.120]   I don't know, it just makes me feel like at home,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.080]   in a weird way, I don't know.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.800]   - It's a little act of fearlessness, I like that.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.640]   - Yeah. - Just eat,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.160]   just put in your mouth and figure it out.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.080]   - Yeah, that's what I like.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.360]   And at the end of the day, she also,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.320]   out of all my girlfriends, and this is gonna sound
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.080]   not strange, but hard to admit,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   but my career when I met Kalaya was in the shitbox.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.880]   I could not get anything going.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.600]   And this is at the time where Ken Jeong,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.760]   who's a very good friend of mine, very talented,
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   was getting everything.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.720]   And I just remember going, I can't even get an audition.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.960]   Like, I can't, I would go on the road, Lex,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.520]   and I would fill half the room.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.880]   I just couldn't sell tickets.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.600]   And when I met her, I was just kind of like,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.160]   maybe this is, I have to find love
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.400]   and open up my world in that way.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.440]   And she was the first girlfriend that I ever had
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.920]   that looked at me and saw the potential.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.000]   And she said, no, this is not, it doesn't feel right.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.320]   You're so funny and you're so relevant to me.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.760]   And this is what we're gonna do.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.560]   And so she started Tiger Belly.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.120]   And then obviously I had the skillset to do it,
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.360]   but once Tiger Belly happened,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.680]   and then Andrew was like, let's do Bad Friends.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.720]   And then now things are great.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.280]   My career is, I'm too busy almost in a weird way.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.960]   And I feel like she had a lot to do with,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.480]   like for instance, before I met her,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.960]   even if I would have get an audition,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.040]   I wouldn't go because I just wouldn't get it.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.440]   In my head, I was like, I'm not gonna get this.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.440]   I've gone on a thousand of these
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.280]   and they just never hire me.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.560]   But she was, so I just didn't go on them for years.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.840]   And then she was the first girlfriend that said,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.080]   no, I don't care if you don't get it.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.960]   I just don't want you to be a pussy.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   And I want you to walk through fear.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   And so she would drag me to these fucking things
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.840]   and I, for some reason, would book them.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.880]   So, you know, in that way--
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.360]   - She saw the potential of what you could be.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.480]   She loved you for who you are already.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   - Yes.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.400]   - But also loved you for the potential
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.760]   that you could become.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.240]   - Yeah, and I'm lucky in that way.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.360]   - So on day one, you could show her,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.880]   you said you could show your flaws to her.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.080]   Like you felt like you could be fragile with her?
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.760]   - Well, I accidentally farted.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.120]   - Yeah, on day one?
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.360]   - On day one.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.760]   You know, because I'm a fart machine.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.320]   And I have loose cheeks.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.160]   - Yeah.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.000]   (laughing)
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.280]   I like how you, for the listeners,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.680]   you just winked at me.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.320]   - Yeah, I have loose cheeks and--
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.160]   - But not in a gay way.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.000]   - Not in a gay way, no.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.600]   And I was, we were on a couch and we're talking
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.240]   and I kind of adjusted my body.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.800]   I ripped one by accident.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.040]   And she laughed, you know what I mean?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.560]   It wasn't embarrassing, you know?
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.960]   And also I have a little penis.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.800]   I have a little penis.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.960]   - It's all relative.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.920]   - Yes, it's very little.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.280]   - But relative to an elephant,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.480]   everybody's penis is little.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.920]   - Yeah, but I'm not an elephant.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.120]   I'm a human, you know what I mean?
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.920]   So relatively human, it's very small.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.360]   And so when she saw it, you know what I mean,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.320]   I thought she was gonna balk at it, right?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   And she looked at it as if it was like an orphan.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.360]   (laughing)
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.280]   You know, like I wanna, you know, it's a lost child
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.160]   and I wanna, you know, take care of it.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.200]   - Yeah, cradle it.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.360]   - Cradle it, yeah.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.760]   Well, you man, you haven't met anybody like that?
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.640]   - Never met a girl, never seen one of them.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.800]   I hear they're nice.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.760]   When are the two of you getting married?
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.560]   - We don't know yet, yeah.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.360]   - Is that something you would like?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.760]   - This comes up sometimes.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.360]   - You know, we're in couples counseling.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.200]   We're working on some issues that we have.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.960]   Every relationship, even my friendships have issues.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   And so we're working through some issues.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.640]   And once we get to the end of it, we'll figure it out.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   - Would you like to be a father one day?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.160]   - This is kind of couples counseling.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.080]   - You know, yeah, I do.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   I do, because I feel like,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.080]   you know, before I was very childlike.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   You know, I play a lot of video games.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.600]   I'm irresponsible, I'm lazy, this and that, right?
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.720]   But, you know, to be honest with you, Lex,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.680]   in the last six months,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.720]   I really have come through some breakthroughs.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.560]   And I'm in therapy and I'm doing a lot of things
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.360]   and really self-analyzing myself and my behaviors
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.120]   and what I want, my desires.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.200]   And I think ultimately, yes, I really do.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.080]   Because it's a life experience
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.640]   that, you know, I don't wanna be an old man
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.360]   looking back and going,
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.920]   it's something that I've always was interested in.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.280]   And I think it's based on fear
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   because I don't want to scar my child
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.920]   the way my parents scarred me.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.720]   But at the same time,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.440]   my parents didn't do the work on themselves like I am.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.560]   And they were never about self-improvement.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.400]   They were just about, they were immigrants, you know?
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.680]   And they wanted to put food on the table.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.120]   And after that, they just went about their business.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.720]   And I'm not like that.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.200]   I would never be violent toward my kids
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.440]   like my parents were.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.160]   My dad was very physically abusive, you know?
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.480]   There was a lot of trauma and stuff.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.280]   And so, you know, as a kid, I thought,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.040]   you know, I just would never put my kid through this.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.360]   So that's why I never wanted it.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.640]   But I would completely do it differently, you know?
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.160]   Even yelling and those kind of things,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.240]   I would be very mindful about those things.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   And I think that I have certain things,
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.960]   you know, I'm not a science-y guy like you,
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.600]   but there are life things that I've learned over the years
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.720]   that I could teach a child, you know,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.080]   about living in the moment or walking through fear
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.720]   or, you know, things will pass and just different things,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.800]   you know, that I would be a good listener.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   And yeah, I would like to do that.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   - So your dad died in August of 2019.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.240]   - Wow.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.480]   - Yeah.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.640]   - He did your research.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.000]   - Yeah, it's on your Wikipedia.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   (laughing)
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.040]   - Yeah.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.160]   - So you said some of it was rough,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.980]   but what's your fondest memory of your dad?
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:06.240]   - Well, those memories happened later in life.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.040]   As a child, my fondest memory was my mom,
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.320]   'cause he never spent time with us.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   So my mom made him take me out one day,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.560]   and he took me to a park.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.600]   Like he doesn't, there was no baseball glove
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.080]   or baseball or anything like that.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.440]   And we sat on a park bench, right?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.080]   And we just sat there for hours.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.000]   We didn't talk 'cause he didn't know English that well,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.440]   and I didn't know Korean.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.240]   So it's just very basic information being,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   you know what I mean?
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.160]   How are you?
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.400]   This is how we go, how you doing?
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.120]   I'm okay, you know?
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.800]   Good, good, good.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.640]   That type of thing.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.800]   - Yeah, for a long time.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.360]   - For a long time, and then,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.220]   but the day turned bad because I forgot my jacket there,
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.040]   and he yelled at me.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.840]   - But there's a bit of peace together.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.680]   - At that time, yeah, there was peace.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.280]   But then what happened was later in life,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.000]   when I got Matt TV, and I was doing,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.400]   in my early years, I'd booked a couple of things.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.880]   Like in 2000, I did The Tonight Show on Leno,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.240]   and then I got Matt TV in 2000.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.080]   And wow, that was over 20 years ago.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   And that's when my parents kind of went, huh, you know?
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   Because obviously, there's some nepotism in Hollywood,
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   but in my case, my parents were straight up immigrants.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.080]   I had no connections to Hollywood.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   And I came up here poor, with no connections,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.040]   and I built it, you know what I mean?
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.200]   Through the years.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.560]   And in that way, I'm very proud of myself
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.080]   because I went through a lot of fucking hell,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.120]   and sadness, and desperation, and all that stuff.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.960]   And I persevered, and I did all that shit on my own, man.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.080]   I booked The Tonight Show on my own.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.240]   I got Matt TV on my own.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.480]   And when I did those things, my parents were very proud.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.720]   - But before that, did they doubt you?
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.560]   - Oh yeah.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.640]   - You're not funny.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.200]   (laughing)
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.640]   You never make me laugh.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.320]   - Yeah, right, and that kind of stuff.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   - You never gonna make it.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.440]   You're gonna be poor all your life.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   You know, that kind of stuff.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.840]   - But Matt TV, he was proud?
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.400]   Your dad, your parents?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.840]   - 'Cause it was a weekly show,
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.400]   so on Saturday nights, they would watch it.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.240]   - They would?
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.800]   - Yeah, and I would play characters
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   that they would understand.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.560]   Like I did Kim Jong-il at the time.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   Right, so they loved that.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.040]   They loved the things that I would do,
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.680]   the physical comedy.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.000]   And they couldn't believe in their mind.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Imagine your parents from Korea coming here,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.120]   not knowing the language, having a child here, right?
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:09.040]   And in their minds, that was never an option, right?
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.240]   And so when they see their kid, I guess, on TV,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.000]   especially, there was no internet too at the time.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.920]   The internet had just started.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.480]   So to them, they were like, this is a musical.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.280]   In fact, when I did The Tonight Show,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.480]   my dad called me the next day and asked me,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.960]   he literally asked me this, he goes,
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:33.040]   how much did you pay them to do it?
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.800]   He thought that I had saved all my money.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.560]   He thought that Tom Cruise goes up there and goes,
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.480]   here's a grand, thanks for having me on.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.480]   No, I go, no, they asked me.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.960]   Conceptually, they were just shocked by it.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.060]   So when I got it, and then they were watching me weekly,
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:52.840]   Matt TV, the producer's like, hey, have your dad on.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   So my dad did two or three sketches on television.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.640]   So those memories, I also did a pilot for Comedy Central,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.500]   and he was on my pilot.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.480]   - Pilot for like a show?
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.440]   - Yeah, show, I think I picked up, but he was on the pilot.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.400]   - He was in the show?
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.320]   - Yeah, he was in the pilot.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.920]   He was on Matt TV too, on television.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.320]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.160]   - Oh, wow, okay.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.480]   - Yeah, yeah, so it's like he would get residual checks.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.320]   - Yeah. - You know what I mean?
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.960]   - Yeah. - It does change everything.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.800]   There's nepotism in reverse.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was really nepotism in reverse.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.040]   And so he, those memories are very,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.200]   I have very fond memories, 'cause he had changed as well.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.760]   He was no longer that violent kind of a guy.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.080]   He had softened a lot, you know what I mean?
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   But when he died is when those issues came up,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.800]   like a freight train.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.040]   - The bad stuff. - Oh, yeah.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.440]   And I didn't know what was going on.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.520]   It was really hard.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.040]   - You miss him?
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.880]   - Yeah.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   - How often do you think about him?
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   - Every day.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.320]   Obviously, a lot of it's regrets, you know what I mean?
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.360]   - Like what kind of regrets?
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   Not having said something, or not having had a conversation?
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.240]   - It's not regrets, 'cause even if he was still alive,
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.520]   they're just things that are impossibilities
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.600]   because of his culture and the way he was raised.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   But my regret in life will always be having those types,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.200]   'cause I was with my mom a couple of months ago,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   and I looked at her, and tears in my eyes were at a Starbucks.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.520]   I go, "Mom, I just wanna let you know that I'm so sorry
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.640]   "that you lived in that house, and my dad,
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.400]   "and dad hit you, and you survived,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.760]   "and you stayed in the marriage because of us."
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.200]   And you know what her response was?
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.560]   "Let's go to Book of the Pebble."
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.080]   She wanted Italian food.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:00.280]   There was nothing there, right?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   And so my regret is that they just will never be able
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   to even grasp the concept of that kind of communication,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.240]   you know what I mean?
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.400]   And I'll never have it.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   So that's sad to me, but there's nothing I can do about it.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   - Yeah, that callous that comes with the immigrant mentality,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.720]   that emotional connection is not even there.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   I've had my grandmother, there's something called
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.120]   holodomor, which is starvation in Ukraine in the 1930s,
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.440]   that you had to live through.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.520]   She lived through World War II, and there's nothing.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.720]   Like the only way you survive that is the callous.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   - Yeah.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.920]   - You can't talk with people that fought in major wars,
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.760]   they can't.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.480]   - They can't, yeah.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.360]   - You can't talk about it.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.520]   - My mom, when she was 12 years old,
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.000]   she walked her little sister, my aunt, to school, right?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.320]   She forgot a book, so my mom goes to my little sister,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.920]   my aunt, "Stay here, I'm gonna go get my book."
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.600]   She ran up, she came back.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   While she was gone, a military truck ran over my aunt,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.840]   and my mom discovered her body split in half,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.320]   in trails, the whole thing.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.120]   And my mom and my uncles had to go and get rice bags
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.080]   to pick up her, you know what I mean,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.280]   and then bury my aunt.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.920]   When you live through something like that,
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.600]   and also the guilt, 'cause my mom believes deep down
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.160]   that if she didn't forget that book,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.760]   that my aunt would still be alive, right?
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.360]   So she carries all this guilt and this,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.240]   and to survive all that trauma, you have to build a callous.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.760]   Back then, they didn't have EMDR and therapists
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.300]   and psychologists and any of that, right?
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.240]   So they had to survive, so that's who she is.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.960]   And it's sad to me that, you know what I mean,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.680]   that she'll forever live in that torment.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.440]   (laughing)
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:03.000]   - Boy, what about your own?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   What's been the darkest place you ever got in your mind?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.520]   - You wrote that down?
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.760]   In my mind?
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.920]   - In your mind.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.980]   You ever consider suicide?
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.400]   - Have you? - I didn't write that down.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.000]   - Have you considered it?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.520]   - In the distance.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.860]   - Yeah, I've distantly thought about it.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:29.200]   About four months ago, I was in a really bad place.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.160]   I was naked in a hotel room in Arizona.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.520]   I hadn't eaten in almost a week.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.800]   I hadn't slept in over a week.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.360]   And I thought I was dying.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.640]   I was coughing up blood.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:51.640]   And I was waiting to go into a outpatient psychologist
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.760]   place, you know what I mean, in Arizona.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.680]   I literally thought I was dying.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.260]   So recently, I was in a very dark place.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.800]   - How much was that connected to losing your father?
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   How much was that connected to rehab and that kind of stuff?
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.620]   Alcohol, drugs? - It's all the same thing, dude.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.240]   It's all the same thing, man.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.040]   It's all from my childhood, right?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.360]   The reason why I do stand up is because of my childhood.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.600]   - The hating yourself or being self-critical,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.760]   that has to do with your childhood?
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.740]   - Yeah. - So the drugs
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.120]   and drinking is childhood? - It's childhood.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.680]   It's all about survival and protecting your heart.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.240]   And there were ways that I did that as a kid.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.920]   Using humor as a defense mechanism
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.280]   and also avoidance of all emotions,
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.480]   you know what I mean, because I just wanted to feel.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.840]   And the reason why comedy is so good,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.160]   the reason why I was able to survive in comedy
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   is because I can withstand a lot of bullshit and pain.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.200]   Like physical, emotional, spiritual pain,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.080]   I can absorb it, right?
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.080]   But now what's happened later in life
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.300]   is I'm unwilling to do that.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.880]   I'm unwilling to absorb it.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.120]   I'm unwilling to carry this weight around with me.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.820]   And it'll kill me.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.820]   So I am doing everything I can
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.840]   to free myself of all this baggage.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.220]   - Okay, so how you're naked in Arizona in a hotel room.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.880]   Face down or face up or on the side?
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.640]   What's your favorite, when you go to a dark place?
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.040]   (laughing)
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.480]   On the floor, on the bed, or--
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.200]   - So what happened was-- - Bathtub, shower?
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.040]   - A fetal position.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.460]   I don't lay on my stomach, that's weird.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.600]   I'm not doing a downward dog yoga position
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.440]   or anything like that.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.200]   No, I'm like-- - On the bed, on the floor?
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.400]   - No, what happened was,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:06.360]   so I had a relapse, so I was drinking all night long.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.960]   - What was the first relapse?
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.040]   What is the first thing you did?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.480]   Just drank, what, wine?
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.980]   - No, I took an edible.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.240]   - And that opened the door?
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.560]   - To drinking, yeah.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.460]   And the combination's not good for me.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.240]   And the excess of the amount is not good for me.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.480]   I just can't stop, and I do it 24 hours a day.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.380]   - Were you alone?
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.200]   - Well, no, I was living with Kalilah.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.060]   - No, I mean, at that moment, when you did the edibles.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.320]   - I was alone, no, I took a flight,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.760]   'cause I was shooting Magnum,
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.680]   I'm on a show called Magnum P.I.,
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.080]   so I was flying to Hawaii, so I bought edibles,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   and then right before I was gonna get on the plane,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.160]   I looked at my girlfriend and said, "I'm gonna relapse."
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.080]   - Oh, so you knew. - I knew.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.920]   So I got on the plane, I took it,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.440]   and then literally the next
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.480]   three months were like a blur.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.400]   - Why'd you know?
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.260]   What gave you the sense that you're gonna relapse?
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.400]   - There was a couple of things that happened in my life
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.960]   that were very shocking to me.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.000]   And I wasn't going to meetings,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.480]   and it's the same old story.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.360]   I was not connected to my sobriety brothers and sisters,
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.200]   and I was drifting away.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.120]   - And something in your mind, it was just--
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.880]   - I just, the pain was too much.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.160]   So I did it, and then, so what happened was,
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   now two and a half months in, three months in,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:50.400]   I started coughing up chunks of blood, right?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.160]   So I was, 'cause I've been a smoker
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.800]   since I was 17 years old, right?
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.760]   And I was smoking so much weed and cigarettes
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.320]   I would just cough up blood.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.160]   But then simultaneously what happened was,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.720]   Bob Sackett and Louie Anderson died, right?
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.560]   And that week, when I was coughing up blood,
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.720]   and because of, 'cause I knew them, both of them,
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.280]   I, just in my head going, "I'm next."
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.840]   'Cause to me, everything happens in threes.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.480]   You know what I mean? (laughs)
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.320]   - Yeah.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.000]   - Yeah, and I'm like, and I had convinced myself
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.640]   that I was gonna die.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.440]   And I was on the precipice of death.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.760]   And so I begged my people to put me
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.240]   into this place in Arizona, so,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.480]   'cause I knew I needed to go to a really rigorous
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.000]   psychology program to get me out of whatever,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.200]   what I was going through.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.120]   And also I was getting, at that time,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.040]   when I was in that hotel room,
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.400]   I had not drank or even smoked a cigarette
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.080]   or done drug in a week.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.400]   I had to wait in LA for this bed to open up, right?
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.840]   So I was coughing up blood, I hadn't slept,
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   I hadn't eaten, right?
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.560]   I was sober, but I was in so much pain.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.920]   And I slept naked by the door of this hotel room
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.640]   because I thought it would be easier
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.360]   for the maid to discover my body.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.120]   I mean, that's how fucked up I was.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.880]   I was just in this prison in my mind, you know?
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.840]   And I'm much better now.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.920]   - Can you give some insights to how to get out
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.720]   of that place, how you got out of that place?
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   - I think getting sober, first of all,
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.440]   was very important, but that still didn't do it completely.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.200]   I still was convinced that I was.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.680]   And then I went to this place and I did,
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.440]   this place is a 12 hours a day psychotherapy place
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   where you do 12 hours, you see therapists all day long.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.920]   - So it's like a 12 hour long podcast every day?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.680]   But with professionals, and they call you on your shit,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.040]   and they tell you what's real, and they tell you,
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.880]   you know what I mean?
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   You know, I'm going, also dealing with still my dad,
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   still some of these other things, you know what I mean?
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.240]   And the third thing that happened was when I got back to LA
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.200]   after that place, I got my lungs checked out
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   and I got my physical done, and EKG, my heart,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.320]   all of it, and I was completely fine.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.640]   You know, and I quit smoking.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.460]   I haven't smoked in almost four months.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.640]   Haven't drank and done drugs since then too.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.440]   So there's definitely a complete clarity.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.280]   And I have to also admit that this time around,
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.400]   it's just been completely different.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.880]   - Is there still in the distance a fear of relapse
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.800]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.840]   Is that still?
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.960]   - No.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   - So you feel good?
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.120]   - I feel great, yeah.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.360]   I feel better than I've ever felt.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.520]   - Even when hard shit happens?
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.480]   - Yeah, because it's like,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.960]   I no longer want to be in that place.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.380]   And also on top of it, it's like,
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.560]   it would be a real shame because I've worked so hard
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.000]   to get to this place in my life,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.200]   not just in my career, with all of it.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.160]   I have so much to lose.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.360]   I have so many people that love me.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.720]   I just don't want to be there again.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.460]   - Let me ask you, sorry, you've talked about this before,
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.300]   but it's interesting.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.120]   - Let me ask you a question.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.760]   Do you always wear a suit only for the podcast?
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.280]   - Yeah, I wear it in private too.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.120]   - Oh, you do?
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.960]   - Not always, no, because I get recognized, unfortunately.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.640]   So I have to be selective about how I wear.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.880]   - Do you like it when being recognized or no?
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.240]   - So because of podcasting, as you probably know,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.880]   the people that at least recognize me
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.200]   happen to be amazing people.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.760]   So it's an immediate connection.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.600]   So there's two things about that I don't like.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.320]   So one, I fall in love with people.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.640]   And so the nature of interaction is like,
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.100]   well, it's gonna be short.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.520]   So you have to say goodbye.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.880]   And I hate goodbyes.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.700]   - You do?
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.540]   - Yeah.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.580]   And the other thing is just introversion.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.980]   Like I just, I'm an introvert.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.620]   I have social anxiety.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.220]   I'm nervous about talking to people and so on.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.580]   So you have to always, I'm walking around always
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:30.180]   a little bit anxious that there'll be an interaction.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.060]   But ultimately, once it starts, it's fun, it's beautiful.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.980]   And then the goodbye is what hurts.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.860]   So both the hello and the goodbye is what hurts.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.300]   It's the stuff in the middle that's delicious.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.660]   - I think there's a beautiful thing though
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.180]   for people like you and I in a weird way.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:49.100]   Because number one, I don't know about you,
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.100]   but I'm an isolator.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.940]   I don't really like any kind of social thing.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.260]   Even when I was doing drugs and drinking,
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.420]   I never do it with people.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.660]   I do it privately in a garage.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:07.780]   And secondly, my girlfriend and I watched "The Northman,"
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.380]   the movie "The Northman."
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.100]   - No, what is it?
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.180]   Does it tell me the plot line?
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.700]   - You've never even heard of "The Northman?"
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.300]   - I have not heard of "The Northman."
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.140]   - It's Edgar's.
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.420]   He did a movie called "The Witch."
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.020]   He also did a movie called "The Lighthouse."
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.260]   You ever see "The Lighthouse?"
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.180]   Okay, you watch movies?
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.020]   - No.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.540]   - You've never seen a movie?
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.820]   - I've seen "The Godfather."
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.020]   - Yeah, I bet you money you've seen "Dr. Zhivago."
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:31.860]   - Yes.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.700]   (laughing)
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.520]   - You have?
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.360]   - Yes.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.540]   - Yeah, you like historical sweeping.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.380]   - Schindler's List.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.020]   If it's not historical or sweeping,
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.020]   you're not gonna like it.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.020]   All right, so how do I explain?
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.660]   It's basically a Viking movie.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.500]   - Okay.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.060]   - Yeah, yeah, and one of the Skarsgård,
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.340]   I don't know, Skarsgård brothers is in it,
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.660]   Bjork's in it, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke,
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.220]   and it's a Viking revenge movie.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.180]   - So why does it make you think about isolation?
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.620]   - No, because, no, what I was gonna say is
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.540]   when we went to the movie theater, right,
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.420]   afterwards, there was a kid sitting next to me,
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.900]   and he just looks at me, 'cause I guess he didn't know
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   I was sitting next to him or whatever,
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.380]   and he just went, "Hey, dude, I just can't believe
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.120]   "you're sitting next to me, and you're my hero,
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.460]   "and I'm doing comedy, and it's really hard."
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.420]   So I was able to give him some encouraging things,
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.180]   'cause that's who I am, too, you know what I mean?
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.180]   I wanna help people, and I also,
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:42.380]   the idea that he likes me, 'cause he also spouted off
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.540]   specifics about my life, about my comedy,
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.980]   and this and that, so he definitely was a fan,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.980]   and I was able to, I'm not, even if I become
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:58.420]   Joe Rogan famous or that big, you know what I mean,
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.060]   I'm always going to say hi to people,
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.180]   I'm always gonna take photos with people,
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.220]   I like that part of me.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.260]   It makes me feel also that I belong in a weird way,
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.500]   because I felt so invisible before I did comedy.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.020]   You know what I mean, I felt invisible,
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.740]   and it puts me in the game of life, I think,
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.560]   in a weird way, so I think it's good for you as well.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.080]   - Yeah, it's a little moment of experiencing love.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:28.300]   It's like, it does feel like celebrating life together.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.020]   You smile at each other and so on,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.780]   although you did say, I think in a recent podcast,
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.780]   that people recognize you, but recognize you incorrectly.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.460]   - That I don't like.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.620]   (laughing)
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.140]   That's the opposite of love.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.980]   - Okay.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.940]   - Yeah, that I don't like, loved you in the hangover.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.780]   - Yeah.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.020]   - You know what I mean, or this is what I don't like,
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.220]   this is why I hate this.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.820]   - Yes.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.580]   - Some guy will like me, right, I'll take a photo,
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.740]   and then other people will go, huh, he's somebody,
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.340]   and will walk up to me and go,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.300]   hey, so why did he take a photo?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.620]   You know what I mean, I want a photo.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.460]   - And then you're like, no, would you do that?
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.300]   No, I don't like that.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.140]   - No.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:11.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.700]   - No, but I do like the experience where maybe,
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.060]   there's a couple, a guy and a girl, boyfriend and girlfriend
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:24.180]   and the guy is a fan and the girlfriend has no idea.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.380]   And it's always a funny interaction.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.220]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.580]   - Because she's trying to figure out what is happening here.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.420]   - Yeah.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.580]   - And it's always beautiful to see.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.940]   - But what if the guy, when the guy explains
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.860]   to his girlfriend who you are,
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.980]   do you feel uncomfortable about that?
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it loads,
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.380]   the information is transferred quickly
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.980]   and she starts to understand.
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.380]   Because she's not used to her boyfriend
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.140]   being excited about a stranger.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:46.980]   - Yeah.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.220]   - It's like, what's happening here?
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.620]   So it's a fascinating little dynamic that's beautiful.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.260]   It's like the spread of information happens right there
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.460]   in real life, it's beautiful.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.940]   - It's mostly though, would you say that
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.700]   it's probably usually men that recognize you or?
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.980]   - No, but men, the thing I've discovered is
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.500]   men are more likely to approach aggressively, right?
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.060]   Women recognize you, they have a different way
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.780]   of like double take.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:17.500]   They don't want to invade your space.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.940]   Guys are like, bro!
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.780]   (laughing)
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.940]   - And then they come in with a hug.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:26.220]   I had a, South by Southwest, had a guy,
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.180]   I was just walking to a 7-11, I go to a 7-11 a lot,
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.420]   my favorite spot.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.260]   - 7-11?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.100]   - 7-11, yes.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.140]   - Why?
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.460]   - Sugar-free slushie, I think.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.860]   For happiness, I find happiness at a 7-11.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.060]   - So adorable.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.100]   - Late at night.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.380]   And he came up and, you know what,
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.940]   can I tell you something that happened to me?
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.420]   I haven't told anybody, this never happened to me before.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.660]   I was outside of a 7-11 in Austin,
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.260]   I'm not gonna say which one,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.020]   and there was a gentleman that approached me,
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.460]   this was at three or four at night,
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.260]   which is usually when I go, I program all night,
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.980]   and I just like to go and take a break.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.180]   He approached me in the way that maybe somebody
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.660]   who recognized me approached me.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.420]   He did a double take, he walked past me,
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.100]   and then walked back, and then looked at me,
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.420]   and I went into the 7-11, I thought, that's weird.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.620]   And then I came out with my slushie,
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:25.300]   and then he approached me,
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.100]   and he said, can I give you a blow job?
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   So I have never--
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.340]   (laughing)
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.060]   - No, really?
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.900]   - Yeah, so the energy he put, I've never had--
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.260]   - Were you wearing a suit?
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.100]   - No. - Okay.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.380]   - I was wearing like sweatpants,
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.820]   and I was very kind of like hiding from the world.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.100]   - Type of thing, I've never had anybody approach me that way,
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.660]   but the energy he put, the love he had in the approach,
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.140]   I thought he would be like--
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.980]   - Love you on Rogan?
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.820]   - Yeah, love, yeah.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.660]   (laughing)
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.740]   Something like love, some kind of,
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.540]   and then he just said, can I,
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.580]   I'm forgetting the exact wording,
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.580]   because it wasn't, the wording was such that he wasn't,
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.100]   he wanted to make me happy.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:15.940]   - Ah.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.100]   - He didn't want to make himself happy,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.340]   he wanted to make me happy.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.180]   - Well, when--
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.060]   - Oh God, can I give you a blowjob?
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.980]   I think that was the thing.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.300]   - 'Cause if he said, can you give me a blowjob,
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.140]   it would be weird.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:27.980]   - It would be very different.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.500]   - No, but I think there's more aggressive way
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.180]   of phrasing that, but he presented himself,
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.140]   see, I forget, it was almost like gentle and poetic,
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.820]   and I was like, I just stuttered and said,
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.860]   no, no, thank you.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.380]   (laughing)
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.220]   - Move past--
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.180]   - That's what everyone does.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.020]   - Yeah.
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.860]   - No thank you to a blowjob proposition.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.060]   - Well, I would probably stutter,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.180]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.020]   thank you.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.020]   - In my mind, I was like, is this a threat?
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.700]   Because it's Fortnite.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.540]   - Ah.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.660]   - I wasn't exactly sure.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.060]   I mean, I've never experienced this.
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.780]   I imagine this is what sort of women often experience,
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.860]   that kind of the danger, the constant threat
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.880]   all around you.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.540]   But I've never, this just, it was a funny little moment.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.140]   I didn't know what to do with it.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:10.980]   - Yeah.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.820]   - That happened, and I go to that 7-Eleven often
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.900]   looking for the guy.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.060]   (laughing)
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:20.180]   - At least now, now I would say yes, no.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:22.740]   - There used to be a steam room in Beverly,
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.180]   on Beverly Boulevard, and my brother and I
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.740]   walked in there once, and we walked in,
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.700]   and it was a man sitting there, erection,
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.740]   and his dick was so big, he was jerking it off
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.660]   with both hands.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.300]   And we kind of walked in, and he goes, "What's up?"
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.140]   And he just did it.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:39.980]   - Kept going.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.700]   - And we just sat there, you know what I mean?
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.980]   Because it was not aggressive.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.820]   - Yeah.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.380]   That was the same feeling, you sensed that
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.820]   it wasn't an aggressive thing.
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:49.660]   - Yeah, it wasn't.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.820]   It was just a kind, he was just minding his own business,
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.420]   and he threw it out.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.700]   - But it wasn't also, it wasn't sexual either.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   It was like, it was like, it's just, you know,
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.020]   it's just like, it's like love or something.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:03.860]   - Yeah.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.580]   - I felt like, it's almost like, can I give you a hug?
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.700]   - Right, then why didn't you just take it?
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.580]   - I keep looking for it.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.100]   Next time I see it, but not in a gay way.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.680]   - I just want to be clear about that.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.640]   - Did you grow up in Russia or Ukraine?
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.480]   - Russia.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.300]   - Russia.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.140]   - Yeah.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.640]   - But your great grandmother, your grandmother was in--
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.120]   - My father is Ukrainian.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   - Oh, your father is Ukrainian.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.160]   - My grandmother is Ukrainian.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.280]   So if you just look at the full family tree,
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.160]   it's about half and half is Russian.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.240]   - There's a lot of conflict with you right now.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.080]   - Internally, yeah.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:33.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.680]   - Let me ask, you've talked about this before,
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.640]   but I'd love to sort of re-explore this.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.560]   Is Carlos Mencia.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.480]   - Oh my God.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.320]   - Yeah.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.140]   - Why?
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:43.980]   - Why go there again?
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.820]   - Yeah.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.560]   - I'm willing to do it, but do you like Carlos?
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.200]   - Well, first of all, I'm friends with Joe,
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.240]   and I remember being a fan of,
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.840]   I'm outside of this whole world.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.760]   I remember thinking Carlos was funny.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.600]   - Yeah.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   - So just as a fan, I was like, oh, funny.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.160]   And then I remember all this big controversy
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.860]   about him stealing jokes.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:10.200]   And because I'm a fan of yours,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.180]   it's such an interesting human dynamic.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.600]   And I'm a fan of friendship and loyalty.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.840]   And you had a great podcast conversation with him.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.680]   It was tense.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.500]   - It was so tense.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.340]   - It was very tense.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.180]   - Yeah.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.660]   - But it was interesting.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.680]   And it kind of, well, it makes me think of you
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.400]   talking to your father on that bench.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.780]   (laughing)
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.620]   - Yeah, that's essentially what it was.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.040]   - Some of it wasn't getting through.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.280]   But maybe, how do you feel about that whole thing
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.120]   about the guy?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.200]   I mean, he gave you, he's a friend.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.480]   He gave you a lot.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.460]   But you're also a comedian, so stealing jokes is no good.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.180]   But also there's like a, I don't know,
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.140]   all the tensions in your heart about all that whole thing.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.380]   How do you feel about it?
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.480]   Do you forgive him?
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.820]   - Okay, let's go back to,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.900]   it's very Shakespearean in a very weird way.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.740]   Why?
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.140]   Because there's some betrayal there.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:07.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.540]   There's a lot of drama when it comes to that situation.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.960]   Again, also, I'm a very loyal guy.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Like I've had the same manager since the late '90s.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.840]   And I've had every gigantic manager wanna sign me,
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.240]   even though my manager is great, right?
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.700]   She's in a big company, right?
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.680]   And there's only so much she can do.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.360]   And maybe, you know what I mean?
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.560]   My career would have been different
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   if I would have signed with a bigger management.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.900]   I don't know, right?
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.240]   But I will never leave her.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.080]   I'll never leave my agent, Matt, you know?
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.920]   People go, "Well, you're at CAA, that's amazing."
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.320]   The only reason why I'm at CAA is because of Matt Blake.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.960]   So there are certain loyalties that I have.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.040]   The Comedy Store.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.480]   I mean, I generally play the Comedy Store mostly
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.560]   because my loyalties are with them.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.600]   I don't know if that's a good trait,
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.960]   but it's just the way I am, right?
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   - I admire that, yeah.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.200]   - Okay, so when it comes to Carlos,
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.520]   in the mid '90s is when I met him.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.160]   I was a doorman at the La Jolla Comedy Store.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.920]   He brought me on the road.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.800]   He introduced me to Matt Blake, my agent, right?
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.480]   And he bought me a car.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.560]   When I couldn't pay rent and I was really desperate,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.600]   I could always go to him for money.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   And he helped me out in so many different ways, right?
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.640]   So I really appreciate that.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.720]   Paulie did the same thing.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:44.320]   So anyway, and then all of a sudden,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.240]   and I always knew going on the road with him
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.840]   that number one, I found it odd
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.280]   that he never had a notebook.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:56.080]   Usually comics riff with each other
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.720]   and they write things down.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.920]   Me, I'll get together with people and write.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.760]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.240]   I'll do a new joke night because I'm too scared
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.640]   to try it in front of a packed room
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.680]   or whatever it might be, okay?
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.280]   He never did that, right?
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.800]   And he had hours of material.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:17.440]   And a lot of it was derivative of other people's.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.160]   He would sometimes hear a bit, change it to Mexican.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.480]   Like for instance, if Paul Mooney had a joke
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.860]   about black people, he would change it, change it a bit.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.860]   But premise wise, it was always extremely too similar.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.020]   And there were examples on the internet.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.180]   So there's things that you can't really deny.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.640]   And so when that whole thing happened,
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.440]   it was like the Titanic.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   I mean, I was either gonna sink with Carlos or survive.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.060]   And I did the worst, not the worst thing,
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.860]   but I had made a difficult decision
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.860]   and my decision was to cut ties.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.980]   And over the years, I have felt very guilty about it
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:08.340]   in some respects, but there is always in my mind,
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.180]   I wanna help him.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.500]   I wanna help him reestablish some sort of a different
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.420]   route for him to go in terms of his career and whatnot.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.780]   And so I had him on my podcast
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.820]   and it didn't go the way I wanted it to go.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.100]   I've always believed if he just fully just was apologetic
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.300]   and said, "I'm sorry for stealing in general
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.340]   "because we don't know specifically."
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.900]   I mean, there's specifics, you know what I mean?
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.500]   And I don't wanna argue every case.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.140]   So I thought the healthiest thing to do
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.360]   was like in just an abroad way,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.300]   "Listen, I stole, I'm so sorry.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.980]   "These are the reasons why.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.700]   "And I'm a different guy now,
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.900]   "but it just never happened in that way."
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.140]   And so it's been difficult.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.740]   - So you don't think he self-reflected looking in the mirror
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.380]   about mistakes of the past at all?
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.660]   Like, do you think he's aware?
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.260]   - I think it's ego.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.260]   I think that he, for one reason or another,
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:16.300]   because there are probably jokes
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.100]   that he legitimately in his heart know that he wrote,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.620]   that people are accusing of stealing, right?
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:26.060]   But it's like, we don't know, right?
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.100]   So it's like, just apologize for all of it, right?
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:30.940]   But he won't.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.620]   He fights for every point.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.620]   And I just think that that's not the route.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.620]   And he, I mean, he's always gonna make money.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:48.500]   But he's never gonna be what he should be,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.980]   which is he's a powerful performer.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.260]   In terms of laughs, I mean, dude,
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.100]   I wouldn't wanna follow him.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.300]   He's a crusher.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.180]   So it's like, it's really, he can act.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.900]   He has all the skill sets.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:08.500]   It's just that, to me, he went about it in the wrong way,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.780]   and it's sad to me.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.940]   But I still always love him,
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.460]   and I've always will thank him
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.420]   for all the help that he's done.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.060]   - So you still got room in your heart for him?
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.940]   - I have room for my heart for a lot of people, man.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.780]   Hitler.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.020]   (laughing)
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.780]   - All right, what was, returning back to Tiger Belly,
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.220]   'cause you said Kalilah basically started it.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.540]   What's the origin story of Tiger Belly?
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.180]   - You know, when I met her.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.780]   - Oh, by the way, for people listening,
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.700]   in case you somehow don't know what Tiger Belly is,
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.780]   it's a podcast you do.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.860]   It's an amazing podcast.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.820]   You also do "Bad Friends" with Anderson Tino.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.660]   - Yeah. - So on.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.860]   - Thank you so much for the plug.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.700]   Appreciate it.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.100]   - I don't know, it's content, it's not the plug.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.140]   - Can I plug other things, though,
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.380]   since we're doing it?
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.220]   - Sure, sure.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.060]   Oh, what's your--
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.140]   - I'm on a show called--
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:54.980]   - Okay, that's enough of that.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.820]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:56.660]   So, what--
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.300]   - What's the name of the show you're on?
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.260]   - I'm on a couple.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.420]   - A couple shows?
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.260]   Oh, that's good for you.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.580]   Netflix?
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.420]   - No.
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.260]   - Okay.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.780]   - I'm on "Sex and the City."
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.700]   - "Sex and the City."
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.580]   - Yeah.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.100]   - I'm on "Reservation Dogs."
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.700]   It's an FX show.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.260]   - Wait, "Sex and the City" is not a joke?
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.180]   - No, I am actually on "Sex and the City."
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.660]   - Wait, are they rebooting the show?
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.500]   - They did.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.340]   - Okay.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.540]   - And just like that, "Sex and the City."
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.980]   - Oh, and you're on it.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.820]   - Yeah.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.100]   - Is this not a joke?
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.140]   - You can Google it.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.260]   - Okay.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.100]   - You know what I mean?
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.260]   - Who do you play?
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.500]   - I play a podcaster on it.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.860]   On the show, Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie has a podcast,
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.740]   and I'm her podcast partner.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.860]   - Oh, got it, perfect.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.700]   Beautiful.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.980]   - But I'm also, now my storyline, anyway, it's fine.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.700]   - Do you sleep with somebody on there?
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.020]   - I am married on the show, yeah.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.300]   They showed my, I'm married to a young lady on it, yeah.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.140]   - All right.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.900]   (laughing)
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.740]   It felt like a joke.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:55.580]   It felt like a joke.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.660]   - I know, 'cause you don't think doing it,
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.700]   I look around going, "Are you sure I'm supposed
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.540]   "to be on this?"
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.380]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.660]   I do feel that, but lo and behold, I'm on it.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.700]   - Yeah, you are.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.100]   - So, I started this way.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.300]   So, you know, my friend David Cho, you know him?
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.420]   He's an artist.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.420]   He used to have a podcast, right, called DVD ASA.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.540]   And he used to have me on it,
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.700]   and then Kalila started doing it.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.900]   And then when DVD ASA ended, Kalila was just like,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.740]   "Let's start our own."
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.580]   And I was like, "Nah, it's not gonna work."
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.540]   So, she goes, "Well, fine.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.620]   "I'm gonna just do it on my own then."
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.740]   So, she went and bought the equipment,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:40.100]   and we were living in a condo at the time in Hollywood,
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.040]   and she would do 'em on her own.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.860]   She did probably three on her own.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.820]   And one day, I was watching television.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.420]   The door was open to the podcast room,
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:55.100]   and I turned around, and she was literally like this.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.380]   We had a table like this.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.140]   She had the mic and all that stuff,
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.180]   and she was doing this.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.540]   She was slumped over like this,
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.820]   and I just kinda went, "Fuck it."
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.660]   So, I walked in there.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.060]   I go, "All right, let's just do one."
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.280]   And that's how it started.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.100]   - And then chemistry was there immediately.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.460]   - Well, I already knew that she could do it
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.700]   because of DVD ASA, right?
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.580]   So, I already knew that she had the skill set.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.300]   It's just all about, even in this conversation
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.760]   that you and I had today, there are gaps of like,
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.380]   "Oh, what else should we talk about?"
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.460]   Or like, "I don't know what direction."
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   And it's all about the old improv rule, adding information.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.100]   Even if you don't know what you're gonna say,
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.700]   just fill the dead space with something.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.380]   So, if right now, if we stopped talking about something,
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.180]   I'd be like, "When I asked you,
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.980]   "Did you grow up in Russia or Ukraine?"
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.260]   Was one of those dead spaces where I was just like,
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.980]   "Let's just throw it out there, see where this goes."
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.860]   And she has that ability to fill that dead space
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:55.900]   with information.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.100]   That's all you need.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.100]   And she gets it in that way.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.980]   So, it's like when we started doing it at DVD ASA,
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.300]   I just knew that she had the skill set.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.620]   So, when we started doing it for Tiger Belly,
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.180]   it was a given, she can do it.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.740]   I've had girlfriends that wouldn't be able to do it.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.780]   What are you doing?
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.860]   (laughs)
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:21.540]   You have the skill set.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.100]   You're a science-y guy.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.500]   You spend all night long, you know what I mean?
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.340]   You know what I mean?
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.380]   And doing whatever you're fucking doing, right?
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.660]   But you have this innate ability to do it, right?
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.780]   And I think it's a talent.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.140]   Do you think it's a talent?
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.220]   No, do you think you have talent?
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.300]   What are you doing?
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.140]   (laughs)
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.300]   I know what you're doing, not adding information.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.580]   I know what you're doing, that's a good bit.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.500]   It's a good bit.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   - I kept doing it and you kept filling the space.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   It's quite interesting.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.740]   - Yeah, that is true, huh?
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:58.020]   - 'Cause you're yes-ing yourself, which is great.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.300]   The improv thing, that was really impressive.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.220]   - Can I ask you a question?
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.060]   - Sure.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.820]   - Have you ever had a guest on that didn't add information
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.140]   and then you had to keep doing it?
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.780]   - Yeah, yeah, but it's part of the magic too.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:18.180]   And sometimes I feel like they were actually giving me
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.620]   a gift of silence and I was stepping on it.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.300]   Like for example, I had a conversation with Jocko,
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.780]   you know, Jocko Willink,
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.860]   and every question I would ask him in the beginning,
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.060]   and I'm now better friends with him,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.220]   that was the first time we met in that conversation.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.380]   And I would ask him these long questions
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.180]   about mumble and meander and so on.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.460]   And he would answer with yes or no, and that's it.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.420]   - Yeah.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.420]   - And then, but he'd do it in a strong, like Viking-like way.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:53.100]   And I kept trying to go full, like Bobby Lee style
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:59.860]   of create chaos and just keep talking and talking and so on,
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.060]   as opposed to, I think he was inviting me more
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:07.060]   for the stoic type of silence, short sentences,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.340]   that kind of conversation.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.740]   So I fucked that up, I believe.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.740]   But yeah, there's, not the adding information part,
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:21.180]   but the adding chemistry part, where it's usually ego,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.820]   where people don't realize there's a magic
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.340]   to be found between two humans.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.900]   Like genuinely, it's like a first date.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.300]   That to truly listen to each other
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.700]   and to do the yes and thing and have fun with it.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:39.900]   When you have this energy, I'm way too important
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.700]   for this conversation, that, yeah,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.460]   the information might be there, but the chemistry's not.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460]   So you have to remember that a lot of the podcasts
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.580]   I've done are like technical.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.420]   - Yeah.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.300]   - And so you could still say a lot of stuff
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.620]   about like what this project, or whether it's physics
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:01.140]   or robotics or biology, you could say informational stuff,
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:04.540]   but the excitement, the magic is not there.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.820]   But I often blame myself, because like,
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.340]   if I'm excited, they'll be excited, I've learned this.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.180]   So I'm learning I'm not allowed to have like a bored face,
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.260]   which my face naturally looks bored,
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.900]   but on the inside, I'm excited.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.740]   - Yeah.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.300]   - So it might be a Russian thing, I don't know.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.700]   - It's not, can I tell you why you're not boring, your face?
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.740]   - Right.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.740]   - Because you have crow's feet.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.300]   - Oh, this thing?
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.140]   - Yeah.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:35.980]   - Is that what the thing?
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.660]   - Yeah, and the reason why you have crow's feet
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.540]   is you smile a lot.
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.380]   - Yeah.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.100]   - Yeah, you're very expressive.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.140]   I know white dudes, I don't trust white dudes, right,
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.860]   with no crow's feet, right, because that means
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   that they're not accessing that part of their face.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.580]   - Yeah, which is why I hate
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:58.000]   when, this is an LA thing especially,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.380]   women have talked to me about like Botox,
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:06.940]   and they hate the crow, they hate, not me, on themselves.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:07.780]   - Oh.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.220]   - And they hate 'cause it's all wrinkles and stuff like that,
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.780]   and to me it's like, no, that's where the,
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.260]   that's the magic. - Magic, that's the magic.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.180]   It really is, yeah.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.540]   - So, okay, so the interesting thing about tiger belly
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.260]   is there's some weird like aesthetic to it.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.020]   It's really unique, it's not just good,
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.580]   it's also unique, like in the way
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.260]   that Wes Anderson films are unique,
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.260]   like Life Aquatic, I don't know if you know those films.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.020]   - Yeah, I love those, I mean, they're my favorite films,
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.860]   yeah.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.400]   - What is that, what is that?
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.620]   It's not just the chemistry between you and Kalilah,
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.500]   it's like, what is that?
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.260]   Can you put a finger on it, or is it just like?
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.740]   - Well, it's essentially who I am.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.860]   That's what my, all my houses have looked like that.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.740]   You know what I mean, like I've always been a collector
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.580]   of designer toys, you know what I mean,
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.500]   I've always been a collector of kind of weird artwork.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.900]   Yeah, I've always been like that.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.420]   You know, I like weird wallpaper, like I'll get,
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.020]   instead of like going to a wallpaper store,
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.360]   what I'll do is I'll get artwork that I like
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.660]   from an artist, like, and go get the, you know,
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.180]   get their approval, and go to a place
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.700]   and make wallpaper out of their artwork.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.580]   You know what I mean?
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.340]   You can, like if I wanted a Lex Friedman,
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.740]   your face on my wall, I would ask for your permission,
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.060]   and I would probably put your face on a gigantic wall.
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.660]   Like, I would do stuff like that.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.500]   - That's awesome.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.340]   - Yeah, but I--
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.160]   - Can you do that?
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.000]   - Yeah.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.840]   - You have my permission.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.380]   - You know, I think I will.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.200]   - Yeah.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.260]   - You know, I think I will just for the laugh.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.100]   - Yeah.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:37.920]   - You know what I mean, but I would do it--
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.760]   - I'd love to get it big, please.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.880]   Yeah, but my point is that I,
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.700]   yeah, it's essentially who I am on the inside, I guess,
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.780]   in terms of like my, you know, I don't know,
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.860]   but I don't really, I've never,
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.500]   I'm glad you said that,
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.640]   because I never even thought about that.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.480]   - Yeah, it's just who you are.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.860]   - You know, you just kind of do it, like this, you know,
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:04.780]   'cause all your podcasts have this black, ominous thing.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.620]   - Yep.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.740]   - You're wearing a black suit.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.340]   You have a specific thing, too.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.180]   It's like--
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.320]   - Yeah, but I don't really think,
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.860]   people ask me like, "Why do you wear a suit?"
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.900]   I really don't, I just feel good in it.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.740]   - Yeah.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.560]   - It's just who I am.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.340]   - And the reason why my podcast looks the way I do
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.460]   is because I feel comfortable in that environment,
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.340]   and it, you know, like you,
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.060]   I don't try to think too much about
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.500]   what I'm doing on "Tiger Belly,"
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.740]   or even "Bad Friends," right?
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.860]   Because when you start thinking about it,
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.220]   and go, "We should do this segment,
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.420]   "and I should, you know, do it this way,
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.400]   "or this podcast does it this way, so why," you know,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.900]   no, I just show up, I keep my mind open,
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.500]   and I do the best I can.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.460]   I add information like we talked about,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.900]   and I just keep talking, right?
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.620]   And I try to be authentically myself.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.940]   Like right now, you know, I had this fear
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.060]   when I was, I was, I shit in your fucking bathroom, man.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.900]   - Yeah.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.720]   - Because I was so scared.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.560]   - Out of fear, you shit out of fear.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.760]   - Out of fear, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.580]   And like, you know, I was like kind of nervous,
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.140]   'cause I, you know, this whole week,
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.380]   it was anticipating coming here,
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.900]   and I watched the Mark Normand one,
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:13.300]   I watched the Giannis one to see, you know, how tonally,
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.740]   and last night, my girlfriend just looked at me
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.620]   and just goes, "Just show up."
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.940]   - Yeah, Kalilah knows who I am.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:24.220]   - Dude, you think that, first of all,
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.060]   let me ask you something.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.900]   - Yes.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.220]   - You think I have the day, you know how busy I am,
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.740]   to drive all the way over here to West Hollywood
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.900]   to do your fucking thing?
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.320]   Why would I do that?
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.160]   - Yeah.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.820]   - 'Cause we are well aware of who you are,
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.340]   and we like you.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:41.180]   - Thank you, man.
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.380]   - God, and we want you on ours.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:44.340]   - I would love that, I would love that.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.780]   I mean, that's, the reason I'm doing this
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.780]   is just to get on your podcast.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.820]   - You gotta get on it.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.660]   - Awesome.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.300]   Yeah, it's funny, 'cause I just mentioned to you offline,
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.700]   I got a chance to talk to Oliver Stone,
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.700]   and he asked me this thing, which is, you know,
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.860]   how many listeners does this thing get,
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.060]   all that kind of stuff,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.340]   and I don't even pay attention to that.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.500]   So it's like, I just don't.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.660]   - A little bit though, you do?
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.980]   Don't?
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.820]   - I wrote extensions on my browsers
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.220]   where I don't see the views, the number of views.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.060]   - Oh, really?
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:15.900]   - Yeah, don't pay attention.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.580]   - Like some of your YouTube videos on interviews and stuff
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.860]   have over a million.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.940]   - That I know, I know like loosely that,
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.380]   like, it bleeds through,
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.900]   but it's not part of my conscious, like,
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.500]   thing I think about.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.380]   I'm very, I've just seen it destroy people's minds
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   where they're no longer thinking creatively,
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.860]   they're not, they don't feel good if something they do
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.460]   doesn't get as much as attention as they thought it should.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.940]   It just can destroy you.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.940]   Even though it's good,
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.620]   it could be great stuff you create
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.140]   that nobody, everybody ignores.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.660]   But it was still great.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.020]   It is still great.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.460]   And sort of letting that negatively affect your mind
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   is a, I don't know, I've seen it destroy people,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.420]   so I'm very nervous about that.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.380]   It's like that old saying, never live in the results.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.100]   It's like if I podcast to make,
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.140]   I'd like initially, honestly,
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:12.980]   when I did Tiger Belly,
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.340]   we made no money for the first couple of years.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:20.780]   Like, not enough to put a dent,
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.540]   I couldn't buy anything, like, you know, nice or anything.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.700]   It was just side money, you know what I mean?
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.700]   I could buy some shoes once a month or whatever, right?
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.780]   And like I said before,
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.940]   I was, my career was in the shitter, right?
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.340]   So Tiger Belly wasn't like, this is gonna be the thing.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.180]   You know what I mean?
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.100]   It was just something to do with my girlfriend creatively,
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.300]   you know, and it just so happens
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.100]   that it did do all these things for me, right?
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.660]   Podcasting, but yeah, I never,
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.660]   and still today, I don't do it for any of those things.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.600]   You know, I do it because it's fun.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.380]   - Yeah, it is, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.340]   - Let me ask you, since you say why you love Kalilah,
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:08.260]   why do you love/hate George Kimmel, your producer?
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.580]   What's your favorite thing about him, let's say that.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.180]   Positive thing, positive.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.820]   - Oh God, I've been asked this question.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.860]   'Cause I, 'cause you know, it's like,
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.260]   you know, I don't wanna give him compliments,
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.260]   but you know, I'll try.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.860]   - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I'll try.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.840]   - Have you actually, I don't think you've publicly
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.580]   ever said anything positive about George.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.620]   - I don't think I have either, so I'm gonna give it a go.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.660]   I'm gonna give it a real go here.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.500]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.660]   - You know, at the end of the day,
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:45.740]   when it comes to money, when it comes to responsibility,
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.540]   obviously this is a business now for you and me.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.900]   It is, you know, it's a side business, but it's a business.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.300]   And you wanna be able to trust the people
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.940]   that are running it.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:02.940]   And I have 100% trust in everything that he does
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.800]   in terms of financial things, in terms of technical things,
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.740]   in terms of all of it, you know what I mean?
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:13.740]   Merchandise, and I have 100% belief in him.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.840]   And that's rare, you know, to find someone like that.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.100]   Also, at the end of the day, I know his heart,
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.620]   and he really is a great guy.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.340]   There's nothing about him, like for instance,
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.500]   you know, he was over the other day, and I go,
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.820]   you know, I bought this key wooden thing
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.180]   that some native man made,
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.380]   and I don't know how to put it on the wall.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.860]   So I just, you know, I go, hey, can you figure this out?
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.260]   And he goes, yeah, I got it.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.840]   Like, he's just that guy, you know?
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.780]   He's also, but there is a part of me,
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.140]   and this is probably wrong,
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:56.400]   but there's a part of me that feels like I kind of made him.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.980]   - Yeah, he would be nothing without you.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.380]   - No, that's not what I'm saying.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:00.220]   - Well, I didn't fucking say that.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.980]   - That's the way I heard it.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.140]   - That's what I meant.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.980]   - Okay, but that's not what you said.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.420]   - And it's probably wrong, right?
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:10.340]   'Cause he did all the things that he has in his life,
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.060]   he did on his own, right?
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.500]   But still, for some reason--
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.700]   - He'd be nothing without you.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.740]   - That's not what I'm saying, but that's what I mean.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.820]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.520]   - So basically, 'cause when I met him,
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.180]   I was a part of this YouTube studio called Maker Studios,
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.860]   and he was just a producer there, and that's how I met him.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.620]   And when he left Maker, he came to us,
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.340]   and he wasn't a podcast producer,
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.820]   and now he has this big company.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.460]   He produces a bunch of podcasts,
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.860]   and he has a bunch of employees,
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.860]   and he has a nice business,
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.300]   and I feel like I had a lot to do with it.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.180]   - So both the competence and the good heart.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.020]   - Yeah.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.580]   - What about Gilbert?
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.820]   - Yeah, Gilbert is a godsend as well.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.460]   I don't know if, because of, let me ask you this,
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.380]   because you're a science guy,
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.340]   this is an interesting question for me.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.460]   Do you believe just that the universe
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:07.380]   gives you certain things at the right moment,
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.120]   at the right time, do you believe that there is
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.540]   a mechanism out there where it's just,
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.900]   we're just a part of this machine that's kinda like,
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.060]   almost as if things are just happening
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.220]   the way it's supposed to happen,
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:23.300]   or do you think that these are just random things
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.260]   that are occurring, and we're just, it's chaos in that way?
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.260]   - I don't know from a science perspective,
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.540]   'cause I wouldn't be able to explain it,
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.780]   but I do believe, you mentioned karma.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.740]   There's a karma thing.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.660]   It just, if you put love out there in the world,
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:41.240]   like certain doors open in a certain kind of way,
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.300]   like they're almost waiting for you,
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.460]   and then you walk through them.
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.960]   So yes, in that way I believe that it just,
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   it feels like not everything is like a basic
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.860]   like billiard ball model of like,
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.380]   you have to fight for everything.
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.980]   You could just generally be cool to people,
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.140]   and kind to people, and certain opportunities
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.740]   just pop up at the right moment.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.340]   - More specifically though, so for instance,
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.220]   let's suppose, like Gilbert for instance,
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.900]   he just showed up at my house one day.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.180]   I didn't know who he was.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.740]   I had a fight night, and a friend brought him.
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:20.360]   This is right when Kalilah and I were starting Tigerbelly.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.460]   And in conversation, he was like,
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.100]   we didn't know how to engineer.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.420]   We didn't have an engineer for our podcast.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   And that night, he was like, I know how to do it, right?
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.940]   And if I hadn't met him that night, he just wouldn't,
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.500]   I don't know if it would be as good,
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.020]   it would be completely different.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:44.020]   And I really believe that we met him that night for a reason.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.580]   So you don't believe that.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.100]   - It's complicated.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:51.620]   I believe that for love and these kinds of things,
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.520]   but I don't believe that as much for building a team.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.920]   But that's the engineering thing.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.660]   I think that's the artist in you.
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.140]   I'm less of an artist.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:04.340]   I think artists thrive in the chaos of it.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.020]   So it's not only that you guys met at that time,
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.860]   is you didn't probably ask in detail
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.420]   about his qualifications,
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.780]   or didn't go through a rigorous thing.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:18.540]   You just dove in and figured it out on the fly.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:21.820]   I think that's sort of the artist ethic.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:24.220]   I think if you're doing a startup or engineering,
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.060]   there's a little bit more rigor in the selection process.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.140]   - I see what you're saying.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:32.860]   - Because the same with Rogan, Jamie just walked up to him.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:35.220]   Jamie Vernon.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.140]   - Yeah, yeah, I know Jamie, yeah.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.540]   - Yeah, he just walked up to him,
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.620]   same kind of situation.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.460]   And then he made it,
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.980]   both of you have one of the best podcasts in the world.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:46.340]   And so it's like, how did that, what?
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.820]   - Yeah, I believe that--
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.660]   - It's very strange.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.500]   - Yeah, it's strange.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.900]   - Or maybe it's just like cool people
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:51.940]   hang out with cool people.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.260]   So you kind of collide a lot.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.420]   - That's not true, because with Bad Friends, for instance,
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.700]   I've had 12 people before Andrew Santino
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.660]   that had asked me to do one with me.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:10.220]   And they just wasn't, didn't want to do it.
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:15.100]   With Andrew, though, it happened kind of organically
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.540]   and in a way that was almost like,
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:22.140]   in my heart, meant to happen in a weird way.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.540]   - That's a weird combination, by the way.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.660]   So why was that the sticky one?
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.300]   'Cause you have a lot of comedian friends, why Andrew?
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.580]   - Because number one, we both know just instinctually,
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.860]   without even talking about it,
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.220]   that in many ways we're polar opposites
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.980]   in terms of energy, right?
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.940]   He's more aggressive.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.980]   I also know I respond good with alpha males,
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.980]   because I'm more of a follower, you know what I mean?
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:49.300]   Or sensitive in that way.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.380]   But in many ways, I am an alpha male
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.860]   in certain areas of my life, you know?
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.020]   You know, when it comes to smashing, what's up?
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.780]   - But you know, so we both knew instinctually
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.220]   that in that way our chemistry worked, right?
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.500]   And also in terms of style and all that stuff,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:10.500]   it's completely just, it was just an organic given to us.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.580]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.300]   - But you trust yourself with power?
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.900]   You play dictators.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.220]   - What do you mean, do I?
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.780]   - Like, 'cause I feel like you would be,
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.700]   'cause you said you're not an alpha male,
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.180]   but in many ways, when you smash, what's up?
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.860]   And you winked at me.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:33.180]   Would you, what do you think about that?
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.660]   If I give you absolute power, would you be able to,
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.540]   what would you, how would you change?
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.780]   - What does absolute power mean?
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.700]   Like you said to me, listen,
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.860]   you are gonna be the dictator of planet Earth,
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.580]   and anything that you want is at your means?
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:48.700]   - Yeah, including violence, sex.
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.900]   No, I would not.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:54.020]   Because even in my personal life now,
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.500]   there are things that I could do, right,
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.660]   that I have power, I guess, that I don't participate in.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.900]   Right, so why would I do it if I had ultimate power?
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.020]   I mean, because there's always,
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.100]   there's still a moral and ethics that I have, right,
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:11.060]   that I don't feel comfortable with, right?
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.540]   So-- - You wouldn't even enjoy it.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.180]   - No, I mean, I think that there would be no,
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.660]   if I had ultimate dictatorship on planet Earth,
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.820]   there would be no violence.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.620]   I mean, I would not cause any wars, right?
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:26.260]   But if there's an uprising, I'd have to quell it.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.500]   - That's how it starts, Bobby.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.420]   You quell it with a bit of-- - Don't uprise.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:34.900]   - Right, but, so first you're gonna censor everybody
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:38.540]   who wants to even suggest the idea of uprising,
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.820]   and then one person gets out of line,
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.060]   they run a red light, okay?
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.620]   That's, that's-- - But here--
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.700]   - You ever get angry in traffic?
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.540]   - Yeah.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.500]   - I get rageful.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.860]   - So if you could murder that person--
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.140]   - No. - No.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.580]   - No, no, no.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.220]   - Nobody has to know.
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.380]   - No, I would give them cancer.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.060]   But I would not murder them. - That's so much worse.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.860]   - I would not. (laughing)
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.860]   I know, I know. - Okay.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.260]   - No, but no, but here, no, this is an interesting thing,
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.740]   'cause I wanna elaborate.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.860]   All right, so the thing,
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.660]   if I was the dictator of the planet Earth, right,
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:18.260]   there would be a reason why people would uprise, right?
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.740]   So give me a reason.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:23.820]   Because I would give them food, shelter, right,
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.580]   and all the things I feel like that people would desire,
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:29.860]   right, but you're right, because you're right,
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.700]   I think this is what you're talking about.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.900]   So here's the deal.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:36.820]   So there are certain things that I do believe in, right?
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:40.180]   Like, for instance, it's a very controversial thing, right,
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.540]   in terms of a woman's right, right,
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.060]   in terms of abortion, right?
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:48.860]   I feel like, as a male, it's not my body,
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.500]   so I don't really even have an opinion,
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.060]   and I shouldn't even have a voice on it,
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.820]   because, you know what I mean,
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:56.080]   it's like if they created laws,
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.780]   if white people, men, created laws for Koreans in America,
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:03.220]   like, you don't have the right to, right?
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:07.260]   So it's like, so if I was a dictator, right,
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.460]   I would just be like, yeah, women have all the rights
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.060]   in the world, right, and they, you know,
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.280]   and I think abortion should be legal
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.520]   throughout the planet Earth, right?
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.260]   But there will be people out there
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.740]   that will believe that, no, you know what I mean?
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.500]   We, you know, we're pro-life.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500]   - So you would put them in jail, just so--
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.900]   - So that's right, so I think as a dictator,
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.400]   there was no way to be able to please everyone,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.500]   so there will be an uprising.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.780]   So yeah, fuck it, I don't wanna do it.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.620]   Would you do it?
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.260]   Not, no, there's several loaded questions.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.700]   Would I enjoy it?
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.980]   No.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.820]   Would I do it?
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.600]   No, because I don't trust my own mind under power.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   Like, I'm well aware that in situations where I have control,
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.720]   it's as much a freedom as it is a burden.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.240]   Like, it can change you.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.300]   I'm very nervous about that.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.180]   - Interesting.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.140]   - Like how much,
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:08.220]   how much the ego starts to flare up,
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:13.220]   how much just like the less pleasant things
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.140]   about your nature come up.
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.500]   You know, I have a temper too.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.260]   Like, I have all that kind of stuff.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.060]   And you have, I'm sure you have a bit of a temper.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:21.900]   - Yeah, yeah, I have a temper, yeah.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.500]   - And so when nobody's able to as clearly call you out
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.660]   on your bullshit, that could be a problem.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:33.580]   - Do you have this, when you rage out and you have a temper,
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:37.040]   is there like either a day later or a couple hours later,
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.420]   is there shame and regret that comes along with that or no?
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.980]   - Yeah, no, no, no, no, of course.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.140]   - Yeah. - During it.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.160]   - Yeah, during it too, yeah, shame and regret.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:50.660]   - But I try to make sure it's like love and respect
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:52.840]   are felt always underneath the whole thing.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.300]   But still, it's like human emotion.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.020]   You can't control it.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.220]   And if you give an absolute power,
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.980]   you start to lose your sense of the world.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.900]   You start to be unable to see what is right and wrong.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.620]   You think everything is right.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:10.140]   You start to have a distorted view
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.380]   of who is doing the wrong things in the world.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.420]   And then also distrust.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:17.420]   Well, that has to do more with how absolute power
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.660]   is usually attained.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.280]   Because when you're in the seat of power,
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.260]   everybody, first on the outside,
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:26.060]   but then in your inner circle, you start to distrust them.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.520]   You start to believe that they're going to,
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.900]   they want your power.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.300]   So the people you love,
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.100]   the people that were source of so much beauty
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:40.100]   for you previously, like even like your girlfriend, wife,
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.740]   your closest lifelong friends, you start to suspect them.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.820]   - I don't want to live like that.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.700]   - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700]   - And you're often right to suspect them.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.700]   (laughing)
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.340]   - Because you think they change a little bit too.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.340]   - They change too.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.580]   They start to get a little bit taste of that power.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.420]   - Yeah.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.260]   - The interesting thing is a bunch of people
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.580]   in Hitler's inner circle at the very end
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:02.500]   betrayed him too in search of their own power.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.340]   - Wow.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.180]   - It's fascinating.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:06.260]   It's fascinating, this power thing.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.860]   Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions real quick.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:09.700]   - Okay.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.500]   - If you could be someone else for a day,
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:16.060]   someone alive today who you haven't yet met,
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:16.940]   who would you be?
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:19.460]   For one day, you get to be, it could be female, male.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.300]   There have to be a lot.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.340]   - I've always wanted to see what a pop star was like.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:23.180]   - Which one would you go?
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.460]   - Like Harry Styles.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.700]   - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.480]   So if I'm Harry Styles, right?
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.280]   I just wanna see what it's like
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.080]   to go to the Beverly Center.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:34.920]   - Okay.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.880]   - As Harry Styles.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.720]   - As Harry Styles.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720]   - Yeah, yeah, or Coachella.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.280]   Just walk around Coachella as Harry Styles.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.440]   - But you get a lot of attention,
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.440]   and it's a very specific kind of attention.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.760]   - Yeah, I just wanna see what that's like.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.320]   I wanna be able to, 'cause the thing is is that
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.640]   I wanna be able to see what it's like
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.160]   in terms of how easy would it be to get a hot chick.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.000]   - Oh, I thought.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:56.840]   (laughing)
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.480]   You meant like get a table at a restaurant.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.320]   - No, no, no.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.960]   I can still do now as Bobby Lee, you know what I mean?
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.640]   But as Harry Styles, I wanna see what it'd be like
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.320]   and how that would go about,
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.760]   how easy it would be, you know what I mean?
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.020]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.320]   Could you just walk up to the hottest chick at Coachella
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.040]   and start making out with them?
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.160]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.000]   Just to see.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.280]   - Just to see if you could. - To test the system.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.960]   'Cause I know as Bobby Lee, no, no, no, no.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.800]   Could you?
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.620]   No, you couldn't do that.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.460]   - No, no.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.320]   (laughing)
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.160]   - It's an interesting reason.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.920]   - So if you were the last person on Earth,
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.160]   like everybody disappeared, everybody's dead.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.760]   What would your day look like?
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.040]   What would your days look like?
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:38.920]   What would you do?
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.600]   That's interesting because if I was able to figure out
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.120]   the electricity, I think my days would be like,
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.840]   "God, why didn't you learn about electricity?"
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.680]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.520]   - Right?
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.340]   - You realize how little you know about it.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.680]   - Yeah, yeah, why didn't you learn about these things?
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.840]   'Cause now you're gonna die.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:55.920]   - Yeah, right? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.680]   - But I think the first thing obviously is,
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.700]   no, let me ask you something, why?
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.960]   Now, if you're saying that I'm the last person
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.240]   on planet Earth because there was an alien invasion
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.440]   and there's predators and things
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.840]   that I have to fucking look out for, that's one way.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.740]   But if I'm just all of a sudden I wake up
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.240]   and just everyone's gone and there's no--
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.080]   - Everyone's dead.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:15.900]   - Everyone's dead.
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:16.740]   - But there's no threat.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:19.560]   - There's no threat, then what I would do is I go,
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.920]   well, let's find a place to live.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.960]   Not probably my house, right?
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.480]   So I'd probably live in a place
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.800]   where it's closest to grocery stores, right?
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.680]   So I would get food and stuff first, right?
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.240]   And then secondly, it's like, I'd probably go,
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.640]   you know what I thought about?
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.920]   I would probably go to San Marcos, San Diego Vista,
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.080]   'cause that's where the real doll factory is.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.520]   - And just fuck all of them?
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.320]   - No, no, no, I would have to grab like six of them
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.260]   because I'm gonna get lonely.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.120]   - Six of them for a variety,
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.880]   you wouldn't be monogamous with one doll?
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.680]   - No, and I also would carry out
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.560]   like the vagina parts, you know what I mean?
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:58.520]   And all the accessories and stuff, right?
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.280]   And then go back to LA probably.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.120]   Oh man, why do I stay down there?
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.720]   - Yeah, you could stay in the factory.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.160]   - No, yeah, maybe the stat factory.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.600]   And then, but I think thirdly,
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.000]   I would run out of electricity, right?
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.480]   And I think, you know what I mean?
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.120]   My demise would come slowly.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.720]   - Well, you could find sources of electricity
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.960]   'cause nobody's using it.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.280]   - But I don't know how to turn the machines on.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.640]   Like, I don't know how to go to the fucking,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640]   - Yeah.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.720]   - What do you call it?
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.680]   - The place where, I don't even know what it's called.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.760]   The place where, you know what I mean,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.240]   where it all, the energy's generated?
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the generators.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.520]   Like, where do I go?
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.720]   - Yeah, it's good questions.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.760]   All right, would you rather lose all your old memories
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.760]   or never be able to make new ones?
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.640]   The past or the future?
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:47.840]   - No, I mean, I can't lose my memories, all of them.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.040]   That makes me who I am.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.720]   - But you wouldn't be able to make new ones.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.680]   You wouldn't be, so you'd be living in the moment,
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.200]   nonstop with all the,
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.320]   but you did say you're in a really good place.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.760]   So maybe this is a pretty good set of memories you got.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.960]   You got all the trauma.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.200]   - Yeah, I mean, you just, that's a nightmare.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.800]   You just created a nightmare for me.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.720]   That's a nightmare.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.560]   - The choice.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.480]   - The choice is a nightmare.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.560]   Yeah, you're fucked either way.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.640]   - It's already beautiful.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.320]   - It's a kind of death, not being able to make new memories.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.960]   That's it, that's all you got.
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.440]   You get to relive the memories you have.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.200]   - As a science guy, let me ask you a question.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.040]   - Sure.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.560]   - Are you afraid to die?
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.800]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.320]   Not of course, I am.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.000]   I think about it every day.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:38.920]   - Death.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.360]   - Yeah, I meditate on my mortality all the time.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.200]   - Right.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.760]   - It doesn't make any sense, it's terrifying.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.680]   - It's terrifying.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.280]   - And because, are you terrified because of the unknown
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.080]   or because you believe it's nothingness?
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.360]   - The unknown, but my best guess
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.280]   is that it's something like nothingness.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.200]   And that nothingness is--
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.040]   - So terrifying.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.080]   - Yeah, the infinity of the nothingness.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.240]   - Yeah.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.720]   But Ram Dass says, and this is something that I always,
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.560]   you know Ram Dass?
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.400]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.880]   - Yeah, Ram Dass says he believes that death
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.720]   is like removing a tight shoe.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.860]   Like release.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.560]   - Yeah.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.840]   - Like, ah.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.120]   That could be it too.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.680]   I think maybe when we die, that's initially,
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.720]   maybe the last feeling that we have is release.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.080]   And then if that happens and there's nothingness,
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.080]   I think that's cool.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.360]   - Well no, that has to do more with
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.080]   the actual feeling of death,
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.800]   which I think some people are afraid of,
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.800]   the experience, to make sure it's one of release,
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.040]   like you said.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:49.880]   - Yeah.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.340]   - But the existential aspect that you no longer exist.
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.920]   Like all the shit you're doing
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.320]   kind of assumes you'll live forever.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.360]   - Right.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.120]   - Like you don't really,
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:02.560]   all your career and all that kind of stuff,
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.840]   you probably will be forgotten.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.880]   - I know.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.760]   - Like completely erased.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.600]   - Yeah.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.520]   - So all you have is a few moments in this life,
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.560]   a few moments of joy, a few moments of trauma,
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.760]   of suffering, and that's it.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.280]   - I know, but here's the--
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.440]   - And you're wasting your time today talking to me,
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.240]   and then you have a few such moments.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.040]   You'll do a couple hundred more podcasts,
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.620]   and then you'll be dead.
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.880]   - No, because this right here, dude, right,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.600]   is human, number one,
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.280]   I walked through a little fear today,
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.360]   so I learned some things, right?
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.800]   I'm talking to a science guy,
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.240]   which I never thought I could.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.320]   You're the first scientist I've ever talked to, right?
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.640]   - You get a diploma at the end of this.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:51.800]   - Oh, good, and I believe that there was a connection, right?
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.680]   - Not in a gay way.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.360]   - Not in a gay way, non-gay connection, right?
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.280]   In certain circumstances, I probably would blow you.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.120]   - Would you?
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.120]   - In certain circumstances,
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.760]   like if we were the last two people on planet Earth
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.600]   and stuff like that.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.440]   - Sure.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.720]   - Yeah, yeah, but yeah, those are probably the only ones,
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.960]   or like somebody put a gun to my head,
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.240]   "You gotta blow, Lex!"
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.000]   - Okay, that's kind of a turn on.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:11.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.600]   - I'm turned on right now, I'm being honest.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.520]   - Yeah.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.760]   - Let me ask you one question.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.600]   - Go ahead.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.760]   - What do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.760]   - My fucking, that's the last one?
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.600]   - Yes, that's the last one.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.000]   - What do you think, why are we here?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:25.840]   Why are you here?
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.720]   Why are we here?
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.800]   Does any of it make sense to you?
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.040]   - I think ultimately,
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.720]   here's why I like life in general,
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.320]   is what we talked about, like we view death,
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.680]   there is a mystery there.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.520]   There's a wonderment to it, right?
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.120]   So it's like, when I walk outside,
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.680]   and I look at the trees, and I look at buildings,
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.360]   that man made these buildings,
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.200]   and I look at the universe, and I look in the sky,
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.440]   and I don't really completely comprehend what's going on,
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.040]   it's just so, I'm in awe of all of it, right?
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.920]   And I don't have any answers, right?
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.760]   But that, I think, is what the meaning of life is,
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:09.400]   is to be in awe of it, and the wonder of it all,
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.200]   and it's just amazing.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.160]   - Yeah, just open your eyes to the wonder of it all.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.200]   - Yeah.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.280]   - While we're still here.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.120]   - Yeah.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.400]   - Bobby, it's a huge honor to finally meet you.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.080]   I've been a fan for many, many years.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.840]   It's an honor that you would even consider blowing me
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.080]   in the correct kind of circumstances.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.120]   - I think you would blow me in the right circumstances.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.440]   - I think that's the definition of love.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.960]   (laughing)
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.440]   Bobby, thanks so much for talking to me, brother.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.160]   - Thank you so much.

[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.320]   from Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.760]   "Laughter and tears are both responses
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:51.320]   "to frustration and exhaustion.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.320]   "I myself prefer to laugh,
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.920]   "since there's less cleaning to do afterward."
