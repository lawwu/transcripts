[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The second epistle of Paul to Timothy in the first chapter and in the tenth verse,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.200]   the tenth verse of the first chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy, "But is
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.480]   abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through his gospel,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.760]   through the gospel." Now obviously this is a part of a greater statement and in
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.080]   order to remind you of the context let me start reading at verse 8, "Be not thou
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.260]   therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.160]   thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God, who
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.600]   hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.320]   according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.040]   Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.440]   through the gospel." Now this is one of those great resounding statements and
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.680]   phrases which we find so frequently scattered about in the letters of this
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.720]   mighty servant of God. It is one of his most remarkable expressions and
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.760]   statements in particular of the great truth and doctrine of the resurrection.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.100]   Now it is most interesting to observe the way in which the Apostle came to
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.840]   make this statement. He was very fond of summarizing the whole gospel. He does it
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.160]   constantly. It was so wonderful to him that he always likes to keep on
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.800]   repeating it as a whole. He puts it into a few phrases and there it is and he
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.040]   does that here. Now I say it's particularly interesting to notice the
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.360]   way in which he came to do that. It's most instructive, and from the
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.640]   standpoint of the practical living of the Christian life, I know of nothing in
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.340]   a sense which is more important than just to observe the way in which the
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.120]   Apostle does these things. Here, I say, is a great kind of compendium of Christian
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.920]   doctrine in a few phrases. But why did he write it? Well, the answer is that he
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.120]   wasn't setting out to write a theological treatise. He wasn't sitting
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.620]   down to write a lecture on theology to Timothy, his young friend and fellow
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.720]   minister in the gospel. No, it wasn't his purpose at all to write a theological
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.440]   treatise. And yet he's very theological. Why did he come to do it? Well, the answer
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   is, you remember, that he was writing to Timothy because Timothy was rather
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.840]   depressed. Timothy was rather frightened indeed. Timothy was very discouraged.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.480]   Timothy was a young man, and obviously a young man who, by temperament, was rather
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.920]   given to discouragement and to depression. He was an excellent man, and
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   yet, I say, he had that particular tendency. We all have some particular
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.920]   weakness against which we have to guard, and obviously this was the particular
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.720]   thing that tended to trap and to trip this young man. This tendency to feel
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   that the opposition and the difficulties were so great that nothing could be done.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.240]   And Timothy at this point felt that particularly because he knew that Paul
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.880]   was in prison. Paul was a prisoner in Rome at the time, and rumors were
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.160]   spreading abroad that he might be put to death at any moment, as he was put to
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.600]   death very soon after this. He was in the hands of Nero, one of the most capricious
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.320]   tyrants that the world has ever known. And here is this man, Timothy, viewing the
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.800]   prospect, seeing the difficulties in his own churches, but above all, seeing the
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.200]   departure of this mighty man of God, of whom he was a disciple, and on whom he'd
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.400]   always leaned, and to whom he could always turn when he was in trouble. He
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.320]   was about to go, so the result was that Timothy was utterly downcast and
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.440]   depressed. And that was why Paul writes to him. He'd heard about this, so he takes
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.060]   up his pen and he writes what is probably the last letter that he ever
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.200]   wrote to this young man in that situation. And you notice how he deals
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.400]   with him. And this is, as I said, the essence of the Apostolic and the
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:02.140]   Christian method. He doesn't offer him any direct sympathy at all. He doesn't
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.200]   speak to him just as men to men, and tell him that he rarely feels for him,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.360]   surrounded with all his difficulties and his trials and his problems. He doesn't
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.520]   even give him a general word of exhortation. He doesn't just write to him
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.080]   and say that he must try to cheer up and pull himself together, that though things
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.520]   are bad, well, we've just got to meet them and face them and get on with them,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.400]   that he must learn how to take it, as we say, and not whimper and cry. That's not
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   the Apostle's method at all. He doesn't write on a personal level, in a sense. It
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.760]   isn't something general. It isn't a general sympathy, nor a general
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.240]   exhortation, nor a general anything. Well, what is it? Well, it's this very thing to
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:58.040]   which I'm calling attention. The Apostle, as it were, looks at Timothy and he says,
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.360]   "Timothy, I've heard all you've got to say, and what you say is absolutely true.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   But listen to what I've got to say." And this is what he's got to say. "God who
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.200]   hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.760]   according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:30.600]   before the world began, but is now manifest. That, and if you still can feel
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.960]   ashamed of the testimony of the Lord and of me, his prisoner in the light of that,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.720]   well, I've got nothing more to say to you." Well, it wasn't quite as extreme as that,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.040]   but that's the implication. You notice the Apostle's way of putting it. He
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.080]   says, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of me his
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.000]   the power of God." In other words, what the Apostle is saying to Timothy is just
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.200]   this, that he feels that he does because he's forgotten the gospel. That's all.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.880]   There's no other explanation. A Christian cannot be depressed and
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.440]   downcast if he remembers the gospel. So if ever you see a depressed Christian,
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.880]   you can be quite sure that he's either not very clear about the gospel or else
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.360]   he's forgotten it. That's the whole trouble. So the Apostle's way of helping
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.560]   Timothy, you see, is not to give him some personal word. He doesn't pat him on the
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.920]   back, as it were, and tell him that he must be a little bit over-tired and
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.480]   having a rather a hard time, and people can be very difficult. Not a word of such
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:53.360]   thing at all. He simply reminds him of the gospel and states it all again. Now,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.520]   as I'm suggesting, this is, to me, the very essence of Christian living, and
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:08.120]   particularly at a time like this. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a form of
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.460]   psychological treatment. Though you may use Christian terms in administering
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.360]   psychological treatment, it is still not the gospel. The gospel never helps us
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   directly, always indirectly. And the way it helps us is to remind us of itself
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:35.180]   and of its truth. Now, I say this is so important for this reason, that all of us
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.680]   get into trouble because we forget that. There is no question at all, our ultimate
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   trouble, all of us, is our subjectivity. We start with ourselves, and we end with
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.380]   ourselves, and we relate everything that happens to ourselves, and we are so
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.960]   intent upon looking upon ourselves, we forget the gospel. And as long as we do
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   so, of course, we shall continue to be miserable and unhappy. The gospel's
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.220]   answer to all our troubles is its own objectivity, its own great statements of
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.400]   fact and of truth and of history. There is no doubt, I say, that all our troubles
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.440]   arise from this. It affects everything from our evangelism to our doctrine of
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.640]   sanctification. We're all along interested in something that's going to
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.120]   help me. Timothy wanted something like that, we all want it, but that isn't
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.800]   what's given. What's given is a statement of the gospel again, the great objective
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.680]   facts of the gospel and of the Christian faith. And it's because we forget that, I
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.320]   say, our doctrine of sin is defective. We don't like to face sin in the New
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.880]   Testament way. We think of it simply as particular actions which trouble us, and
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.080]   we think we need help and this and that. It isn't what we need, it's our whole
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.640]   position face-to-face with God that matters, the thing that Paul brings
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.720]   Timothy back to. Timothy says to Paul, in effect, "Look here, stop thinking about
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.240]   yourself and your immediate problems in your churches. See yourself in the
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   context of the gospel, and then you'll see everything entirely differently." And
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.700]   this is, I say, the thing we need to remember. Our view of sin is wrong and
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.980]   our view of the gospel is wrong unless we face it in this particular way. Well
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.900]   now then, let's follow the Apostle as he does it. How does the Apostle help this
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:48.580]   depressed, discouraged, rather miserable young Christian man? Well, he just takes
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:56.700]   him back and reminds him of the glory of redemption, the glory of the gospel. You
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.020]   see how he says it all? He isn't content with bits of it. He takes us right back
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.260]   to the beginning. "Be thou partaker," he says, "of the afflictions of the gospel
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.260]   according to the power of God." And now then, he reminds us of it all. What does
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.860]   he say? "Who hath saved us and called us with unholy calling, not according to our
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.540]   works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:32.860]   Jesus before the world began." And if you don't see it all there, well, I almost
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:40.440]   despair. You see, Timothy starts with the immediate present. We all do the same. The
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.340]   modern world, the atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb, this immediate problem.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:51.460]   What does Paul say? He takes us back to eternity, before the world began. We seem
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.780]   to think that the world never had any troubles until we came into it. We are in
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.300]   the present, and we live in the present, and it's our problem, our twentieth
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:11.180]   century problem. Go back onto the eternal hills. Something has been done about this
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.660]   world before it was ever created. Before the world was ever made, before man was
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.180]   ever created, God's plan of redemption was already worked out entirely in the
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:34.100]   mind of God. It was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began. Here is an
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.700]   end, you see, a Christian minister worried about himself and his future and about
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:43.700]   the churches. "My dear," Timothy says, "Paul, can't you see that God has planned the end
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:49.180]   as well as the beginning before the world was ever made?" How foolish we are,
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.900]   how ignorant, how stupid, how forgetful of these eternal things. The fact is, my
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.580]   friends, that the whole of salvation is already known to God and was there in
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:10.700]   his mind before the very beginning of time. Paul had to keep on saying this
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.620]   kind of thing to Timothy, didn't he? Do you remember how he puts it in the next
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:21.420]   chapter? Timothy felt the whole world was rocking and shaking. Timothy says, "Paul, the
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:28.700]   foundation of God standeth sure. Having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.700]   his." He knows the exact number of the elect, he knows his own people, he has
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.580]   foreknown them before the very foundation of the world, and hell and all
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:47.740]   else can never make the slightest difference. Given us in Christ Jesus
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:55.940]   before the world began. And remember, it was given to you then, to the individual
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.940]   Christian. He was known to God then. His name was in God's book of life, there,
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:09.500]   before the very world was even created. And then he goes on to describe it still
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:18.140]   further. He tells us that God, as the result of this great plan, has saved us. Saved us
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:24.700]   from rock, saved us from hell, saved us from all the consequences of sin, which
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.980]   I'm going to elaborate. And not only that, he tells us, he hath called us with unholy
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:38.700]   calling. That's salvation. Salvation is not only forgiveness of sins, thank God
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.780]   it is that. If it were not that, we are all damned and undone. But it isn't only
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:51.380]   that. It calls us to unholy calling. It's a new life, something entirely different.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:58.380]   It's a life for the people of God. Saved, translated into a holy calling, a holy
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.300]   life. Never separate these things, they always go together. You can't be
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.780]   justified without your sanctification already started. You can't separate these
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.260]   things. And not only that, he even takes the trouble to say this, remember, in this
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:19.940]   glancing word, and not according to our works. In other words, we don't save
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.660]   ourselves. It isn't our own actions, it isn't our own activities. If we are
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.460]   Christians this morning, it is entirely due to the grace of God. It is all of his
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.780]   mercy. And you and I are in this building, whereas so many millions of people are
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:41.660]   in anywhere but in the house of God this Easter Sunday morning, not because of
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.980]   anything in us, not because we are better in any way at all, but because the grace
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:55.500]   of God has called us, and saved us, and called us with unholy calling. Very well,
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.620]   there's the general statement. But the particular thing the Apostle was anxious
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:06.740]   to impress upon Timothy was this. All that, he says, is something that in a
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.780]   sense had happened before the very creation of the world itself. It was all
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:19.260]   there perfectly in the mind of God, and in a sense it all already happened. But
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:29.780]   it is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ. In other
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.700]   words, what God had planned in eternity was actually put into practice and
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.020]   carried out when the fullness of the times had come, and the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:43.940]   came into this world. That is where the history is so important. It isn't an
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:49.340]   idea, it is an idea that's been carried out, that has been put into operation. So
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.100]   we must always remember the birth in Bethlehem. We must always remember all
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.900]   the facts about him as we're given them in the Gospels. That's why we have our
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:03.060]   Gospels. They must all be related to these facts. We must never forget Good
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.180]   Friday. We must never forget Easter Sunday. We must never forget the forty days. We
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.660]   must never forget the Ascension. We must never forget the descent of the Holy
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:18.460]   Ghost on the day of Pentecost. The facts. There it is in idea, perfect, but it has
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:25.800]   now been made manifest, openly declared, put into operation by the coming of the
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:35.020]   Son of God into this world, and supremely by the resurrection. This is the thing.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.260]   This is the thing that gives us final proof of it all, because by the
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.780]   resurrection, he tells us, he hath abolished death and hath brought life and
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.900]   immortality to light through the Gospels. Now what does he mean by this? Well, let
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.540]   me just work it out a little for you in detail. In order that we may see the kind
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.900]   of comfort that the Apostle intended Timothy to receive. If you only understand
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.940]   this, says Paul to Timothy, you'll no longer look at your problems and troubles.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.940]   You'll be a glad partaker with me of the afflictions of the Gospel, knowing that if
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.260]   we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him. Timothy, it's because
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.540]   you've forgotten the context that you're unhappy. You've forgotten the whole. And
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:29.520]   here it is. What has he done? Well, he's abolished death. Now, unfortunately, that
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.540]   word "abolished" isn't a very good translation. It's misleading, isn't it?
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.980]   People say, what's the use of saying that Christ, by the resurrection, has
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.300]   abolished death, when Christian people have been dying ever since then, and are
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.680]   still dying? How can you say that he's abolished death? A perfectly fair
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.940]   question. It's an unfortunate translation. Let me give you some
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:02.420]   alternative translations, which will convey the idea more concretely. It
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:09.660]   really means to render negatory. Or, if you prefer it, to use a modern word,
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:17.300]   it means to frustrate. Frustrate. Or, if you like still another, you may say that
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:23.380]   it means to quash. You quash a verdict. A verdict has been passed, then you appeal
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.180]   to a higher court, and the verdict is quashed. It's rendered negatory, of no
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:33.800]   effect. It's put on one side. Or, if you prefer it in technical terms, you can
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.460]   talk about dismantling. You dismantle a machine, you take it to pieces, it can no
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.580]   longer operate, it's been dismantled. That's the word. Or, take another,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.700]   disempower. You take away its power, the thing that empowered it is removed. Or,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:56.160]   another, to nullify, to render null and void. Or, indeed, to be still more modern,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:02.620]   you can literally translate this as putting out of gear. And when you put a
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.700]   machine out of gear, it no longer pulls, it no longer operates. Now then, that's
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.980]   what the Apostle says, that the Lord Jesus Christ, by doing all that he's done, has
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:18.060]   put death out of gear. He's dismantled it. It's there in a sense, and yet it doesn't
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.160]   work as it did work. The machine is still there, though it isn't in gear, but it's
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.260]   not operative, it's doing nothing. It's rendered negatory, it's been nullified.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.700]   And that is what he tells us the Lord Jesus Christ has done to death. He's put
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:38.980]   it out of gear. He's nullified it, rendered it inoperative. Now, what does he mean by
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:45.740]   this? Here, of course, we are at once face to face again with the great central
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:53.780]   facts of salvation. Where has death come from? Why is there such a thing as death
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.780]   at all in this world? And to answer that question, you go back to the
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.660]   book of Genesis. And, my dear friend, you cannot understand the New Testament
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.940]   doctrine unless you accept the book of Genesis. Death came into the world as the
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:15.540]   result of sin. There's no other explanation of it. It was never intended
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.620]   to be in this world. At the beginning it wasn't in the world. God made all things
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.180]   perfect and he saw that they were good, and there was no death there. There was
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:29.260]   no principle of death. Death has come in as the direct sequel and consequence of
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:40.220]   sin. Man's disobedience of God, man's rebellion against God. God had already
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:46.180]   warned men, he said, in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:52.380]   Death is God's imposed punishment for sin. And when men did sin, death came upon
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.380]   him. The penalty followed. First of all, spiritual death, and then physical death
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:04.060]   is more. The moment men sinned, this is what happened to him. He lost his contact
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:09.700]   with God. That's spiritual death. "This is life eternal," says our Lord, "that they
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.980]   might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sinned." Not to
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.260]   know God is to be dead spiritually. The moment men sinned, he died spiritually.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:25.020]   The separation between God and men came in. Yes, but it even led to physical
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:35.300]   death. And physical death, in turn, leads to corruption. There was no corruption in
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:42.460]   the world before sin came, but sin leads to corruption. When the body dies, it
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:48.620]   begins to putrefy, and to become corrupt, and become offensive. You
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.940]   remember the phrase about Lazarus in the grave, when our Lord said that he was
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.780]   going to raise him. Martha objects, she says, "Don't you realize he's been dead
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:06.140]   four days and now stinketh?" Putrefaction, corruption, a consequence of death.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.660]   Putrefaction. What a horrible thing sin is. What a terrible principle it's
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.780]   brought into this world. Death, loss of life, loss of contact with God, loss of
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.340]   this vital principle, and the body dies and rots, and becomes corrupt. Sin has
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:29.860]   done all that. If you want a full exposition of it, read at your leisure
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.940]   the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. He says, "Because Adam sinned,
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:43.500]   death passed upon all men." And it has, and it still continues. And in spite of all
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:51.420]   the advances of science and of myth, men still die and their bodies putrefy. Sin.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:58.860]   But the Lord Jesus Christ has come into this world to deal with it. And this is the
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.380]   glory of the message of the resurrection. This is why it's always called the hope
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.940]   in the New Testament. You see, as the result of sin and the consequences of
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.660]   sin in the form of death, spiritual and physical, the world has become hopeless.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.780]   That's why life is a burden. That's why most men and women are unhappy in this
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:26.860]   life and in this world. Why? Well, it's a sort of bondage. You remember how the
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.060]   author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it in the second chapter. He says
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.540]   that we're all throughout all our lives a subject of bondage because of the fear
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:41.380]   of death. Death is an awful spectre that's there in the distance. And do what
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.940]   we will, it seems to be coming nearer and nearer. We're all horrified today of
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.820]   becoming old. We do everything we can to keep young and to appear young, and we
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.260]   won't talk about death. We regard it as morbid. We don't like to think about
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.300]   eternity. We look for the present and the modern world. We're afraid of it all.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:03.020]   It's there as a kind of incubus. And that's why we are so worried about
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.940]   circumstances. That's why we're so terrified of atomic bombs. It means death
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.020]   for us. And death is such a terrible thing because it's the end of life in
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.900]   this world. And this is the only world we know about. And we don't want to go out
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.540]   of it therefore. And everything becomes a burden and we're troubled. It's that
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.740]   awful thing called death, which is the end of everything and sucks out things.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:33.460]   That's it. This fear of death hangs over us. And all our problems and difficulties
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.540]   are considered in the light of this. So we all want to abolish war. Of course it's
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.740]   perfectly right, but the question is, is our reason for desiring it right? And if
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.460]   we're frantic about these things, it's simply because the consequence of sin is
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:55.180]   death. But Christ has come. And what has he done? He's put it out of gear. He's
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.340]   dismantled it. He's rendered it inoperative in the case of those who
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   belong to him. How? Well, he's done it like this. How, someone may
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.140]   ask me very rightly, how do you say that the Lord Jesus Christ has put death out
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:15.340]   of gear? How has he rendered death in the case of the Christian, null and void?
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.980]   Well, let the Apostle Paul answer himself. Again, I commend to you on a day like
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.260]   this, a careful reading and study of the 15th chapter of his first epistle to the
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.580]   Corinthians, where he's worked this thing out fully and in detail. Let me give you
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:37.380]   the essence of his argument, which is this. What's the trouble about death? Well,
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:49.780]   the sting of death is sin. And the strength of sin is the law. What's the
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:54.220]   matter with death? What is the sting in death? What is it about death that makes
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:01.500]   it the terrible power that it is? "Ah," says the Apostle, "it's sin." Well, how is sin the
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   death, the sting of death, in this way? That if we all could, of course, be
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.980]   absolutely certain that death is the end of all things, well, even death wouldn't
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:21.460]   be so bad. It would sometimes be preferable to life. But is death the end?
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.580]   Can I be sure that if I go out of this world that that's the end of me? I'm
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.420]   overwhelmed with troubles and trials. I may be left alone. My dear ones have gone.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.980]   And I say, "Why should I go on living in a world like this? I'm miserable. I've lost
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:44.060]   all that meant life to me. Why not go out of it?" "Ah," says Shakespeare, "thoughts of that
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:53.420]   unknown born from which no traveler returns, we don't know. What if? What if I
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.820]   go on? What if there is a life beyond? And what if the Bible is right when it talks
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.780]   about God and judgment and eternal destiny depending upon that judgment?
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.860]   What if the sting of death is sin? I'm conscious that I'm unworthy, that I'm
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.940]   sinful. I may say that I don't believe in God and yet I'm still afraid of God. I
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.420]   say I don't believe in a future life and yet I'm afraid there may be one and that
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:23.020]   I will have to answer for my life and for my sin. The sting of death is sin. And
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.940]   what puts power into all that is the law of God, the law that God has revealed in
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.300]   which he has denounced sin and denounced his punishment upon sin. That's the
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.180]   strength of it all. Do what I will. I can't get away from it. There is that law
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:42.700]   of God that is condemning me and while it does, death is a specter, a horror to
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.860]   me. I'm afraid of it. I don't know what to do. It's there standing over against me as
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:54.580]   an antagonist. But Christ has put it out of gear. He's taken the sting out of it.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:03.180]   How? Well in this way. By dying upon the cross he has fulfilled the law. He has
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.740]   fulfilled the law not only for himself but for me. When the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.980]   died upon that cross he was dying for my sins. Not only the sins I have committed,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.460]   the sins I shall commit, more than that he has satisfied God's eternal law. He
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:25.780]   has fulfilled the law for me. The terrors of law and of God with me can have
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:32.340]   nothing to do. My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:38.620]   view. I finished with the law. I'm dead unto the law. I'm dead unto sin. Christ
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:44.540]   has satisfied the law and so he's taken the power out of sin and so the sting is
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:51.980]   taken out of death. That's how he dismantles it. That's how he renders it
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:30:04.460]   nuggatory. You see, having done all this for me I am able to say this, that already
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:11.380]   he has given me spiritual life. The life that I lost in Adam has been given back
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.500]   in Christ. You read his second, Paul's second epistle, second chapter of his
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.580]   epistle to the Ephesians and you'll find that he puts it there like this. Do you
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.580]   remember it? "And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins,
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:32.260]   wherein in time he passed walk." We've been quickened. We are given spiritual
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:38.180]   life immediately. We have been quickened with Christ. We have been raised with
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:45.460]   Christ. We are even seated in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus. The
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.380]   spiritual life we lost in Adam has been given back in Christ. We are already
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   alive to God, spiritually. But you know, my friends, it's even going to happen
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:05.020]   physically also. And this is the peculiar emphasis of the resurrection, isn't it?
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:12.340]   Death to the Christian becomes just the sleeping, the sleep of the body. Do you
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.860]   remember how we are told about the martyr Stephen, that he fell on sleep? Do
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.460]   you remember how Paul, in comforting the Thessalonians about their loved ones who
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.460]   were dead, says that they needn't be concerned about them that are asleep?
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.140]   That they are not going to take part in the resurrection? He says don't be
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.540]   worried about them that are asleep. You see, to the Christian, understanding that
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.220]   Christ has fulfilled the law and satisfied it, and therefore taking the
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:45.540]   sting out of death itself, because he's removed the power which was in the law,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:53.340]   the Christian therefore has an entirely new view of death, even the death of the
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:59.020]   body. He knows that what is happening now is that that body of his is simply going
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.180]   to be there in a state of sleep. He's not in a state of sleep. He is to be with
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.540]   Christ, which is far better. But his body will be in a state of sleep until the
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.380]   great morning of the resurrection arrives. And then that body will arise, as
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.700]   I'm going to show you. So the victory, you see, is complete. And thus says the
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.020]   apostle that the man who believes in Christ can turn to death and can say, "Oh
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:30.860]   death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?" That's what the
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.140]   resurrection means. That you and I should be able to look into the face of death
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.620]   this morning and smile at it and say, "You don't frighten me any longer. Oh
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:46.220]   death, where is thy sting?" Look into an open grave and say, "I know my body will
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.220]   soon be there, but there's no victory for the grave. It's been dismantled. It's out
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:58.340]   of gear. It doesn't affect me at all. I simply fall asleep." He hath abolished death.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:04.340]   He's rendered it nuggetary. And a Christian has no right to be afraid of
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:10.900]   death. In the resurrection he should see that it's utterly dismantled. It's still
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:16.220]   there, but it hasn't power over the Christian. It's nothing to him. It's
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.780]   simply the sleep of the body, while he and his spirit goes on to be with Christ,
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.980]   which is far better. But for me to finish it, let me just say a word about the last
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:30.100]   statement. He has not only abolished death, but he has brought life and
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:36.340]   immortality to light through the gospel. Again, it's a pity we've got the word
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:42.780]   "immortality". It really means "incorruption". He has brought life and
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:48.100]   incorruption to light. What does he mean by this? Well, let me put it to you like
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.260]   this. The Greek philosophers, you know, had at long last arrived at some vague
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.580]   belief in the immortality of the soul. Before they'd worked that out, people
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.060]   just thought that death was the end. But the Greeks, with their minds and
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.860]   understandings, had reasoned rightly that that couldn't be the case. They'd gone as
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:11.020]   far as a dim idea of the immortality of the soul. But it was all vague and very
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:16.420]   indefinite. And even in the Old Testament, the teaching isn't very clear. It is
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.820]   there, but it isn't clear as it is in the New Testament. But when you come to the
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:29.380]   New Testament, it's brought to light. He has brought life to light. How did he do
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.140]   so? Well, in his teaching. You remember, they came one day and tried to trap him
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.620]   about the woman who married the seven brothers, and they thought it was a very
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.820]   clever question. They said, "Which of them will be our husband in this future life
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.260]   that you talk about?" And our Lord turned the tables on them and answered them, but
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.140]   then ended with this statement. He said, "God is not the God of the dead, but of
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.780]   the living." He said, "I am the God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob," when he
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.300]   spoke to Moses. And by that he's saying that these people are alive in his
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.540]   presence. They're still there. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:10.860]   And many other parts of his teaching affirm the same thing. But it's in the
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:16.580]   resurrection he has really brought life and incorruption to light. For in the
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:22.900]   resurrection we see not only that he is still alive. There are many who think
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.500]   that that is what is meant by resurrection, that the Spirit of Jesus is
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.940]   still alive, and his memory can still help us, and he in a sense can still help
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.300]   us. They just believe in the kind of persistence of his being. That isn't the
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.100]   teaching about the resurrection. He's not only brought life to light, as I've
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.740]   shown you, but incorruption also. For the teaching of the resurrection is not only
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:53.100]   that Christ still continues and persists, but that he literally arose out of the
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:36:01.460]   grave in his body. The same body, the physical body. Yes, and without corruption.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.820]   And that is why he is the firstborn from amongst the dead. He has fulfilled the
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.100]   prophecy of Psalm 16, where we read, "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.260]   suffer thy holy one to see corruption." And it's not surprising that Peter,
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.820]   preaching on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, should have quoted that. He
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.060]   says, you know, he's proved that. Though he died and was buried, he arose and there
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:30.180]   was no corruption in his body. Here is resurrection. He is the first to rise
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:35.300]   from the dead. He is the firstborn amongst many brethren. He has brought in
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.840]   corruption to life, to light. He has not only proved that he has conquered the
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.460]   grave spiritually, but even physically. He rises in the body, and it's a body
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:53.780]   without corruption. It's a glorified body. And this is a wonderful thing for us,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.900]   because do you know that this is an essential part of your salvation and
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.940]   mine? Christian salvation not only teaches that I say that I am forgiven
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.380]   and reconciled to God, and that I'm going to spend my eternity in the presence of
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.260]   God. Do you know it goes on and says this, "I am going to spend eternity in the
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:23.300]   presence of God in my body, in this body, which shall be changed and glorified." Do
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.100]   you want me to give you my authority? Well, listen to the Apostle putting it at
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.820]   the end of his third chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians. Our
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:37.620]   conversation, he says, is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:44.640]   Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, this body of my humiliation,
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.300]   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:56.540]   whereby he is able to subdue even all things unto himself. When he comes, he'll
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.780]   even take this body of mine, and he'll change it, he'll rid it of all corruption,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:12.380]   and it will be incorruptible and perfect. He will put on incorruption. "We that are
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.500]   we ourselves," says the Apostle again to the Romans in the eighth chapter, verse
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:23.060]   23, "we ourselves," he says, "who have received the firstfruits of the Spirit to
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:32.500]   groan, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." Your body is
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.220]   going to be redeemed. The corruption is going to be taken out. It will no longer
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:42.340]   putrefy. It will no longer decay. It will be a body glorified, perfect and entire,
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:48.980]   which will last to all eternity and can never putrefy or in any way show
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.200]   signs of corruption. Listen to him again. "But if our earthly house of this
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.940]   tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made, with
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:08.940]   hens eternal in the heavens." And finally listen to John saying, "We know not yet
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:17.940]   what we shall be, but we do know this, that when he doth appear, we shall see
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:28.020]   him as he is, and we shall be like him." Like him in our very bodies, all the
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:35.460]   vestiges of sin removed, every trace of evil entirely put away, not only perfect
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:41.620]   in spirit, perfect in body, glorified in spirit, glorified even in my body, he has
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:51.880]   brought life and incorruption to light through his Gospel. Though he died and was
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:57.540]   buried in a grave, his body didn't putrefy, there was no corruption there.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:02.060]   It wasn't possible that it could happen to him because there was no sin in him,
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:07.960]   and it didn't happen, and he arose in the glorified body proving it. And what has
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:13.180]   happened to him will happen to all who trust in him and who look for his
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:22.960]   appearing. That's Paul's answer to Timothy. The care of the churches, difficult
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.060]   people in the churches, what's going to happen when Paul dies? Is Christianity
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:32.980]   going to go on? What if a war breaks out? Yes, I'm bringing it up to date, you see.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:38.140]   What if the atomic bomb is used? What if a hydrogen bomb or the cobalt bomb? What
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:46.700]   then? What's going to happen to us? I don't know. And will you misunderstand me
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:58.180]   if I say I don't care? Because whatever happens, I know that nothing can separate
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:07.060]   me from him. My spirit is already glorified in him, and though this body of
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:15.140]   mine be blown to ashes, I know that in this body glorified and without
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:26.420]   corruption, I shall see him and spend my eternity in his glorious presence. If the
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:31.100]   world today is tending to oppress you and to get you down, if anything is
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:39.300]   depressing you and discouraging you, the answer is, look at him. Look at him. He
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:45.580]   hath brought life and incorruption to light. And it'll not only happen to you
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.660]   if you're in Christ, it's going to happen to the whole world. Sin and evil
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.740]   are going to be burnt out of existence. There'll be a mighty conflagration. The
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   elements will melt with fervent heat. And the world, the whole cosmos, will be
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:04.420]   purified. And there shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   righteousness. And in which you and I, if we believe in Christ and belong to him,
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:21.460]   shall dwell gloriously. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. Amen.
