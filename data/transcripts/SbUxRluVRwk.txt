[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   -
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:16.400]   - All right, thanks everybody for joining today.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.480]   My name is Dennis Linkov.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.240]   I lead the machine learning team at WiseDocs
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.660]   and I'll be talking about hiring a modern AI team.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.440]   So who's heard this message before?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.900]   We are now an AI first company.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.820]   We've seen companies like Shopify, Duolingo, Zapier,
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.940]   all make these announcements
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.900]   saying that they're AI first companies.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.680]   And they're saying that there are new expectations
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.460]   that before you hire a person,
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.300]   you need to make the claim
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.860]   that you can't hire an AI agent or use AI.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.060]   We're now seeing big tech companies
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.300]   and many companies in general
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.020]   sharing how much code is being written by AI systems
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.320]   and how this is going to lead
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.420]   to the extinction of the software engineer.
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.800]   So now, if you're in the position to hire people,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.000]   you'll ask the question, now what?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.480]   So we're going to talk about three main themes today.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.780]   The first one is the anatomy of an AI team.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.720]   The second is the evolution of a generalist.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.580]   And the third is the question of hiring.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.200]   So let's start off with the anatomy of a team.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.460]   So there is a spectrum of different companies
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.780]   and this is where we should start.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.020]   We have technology companies
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.360]   where technology is the core value proposition
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.580]   that is being offered.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.160]   We know big tech companies, we know many startups.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.700]   There's also verticalized solutions
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.940]   or services companies such as Palantir
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.560]   or the company I work at, WiseDocs.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.220]   And there's also tech enabled companies
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.920]   where the core product is not technology,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.220]   but it is something that benefits dramatically
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.340]   from good tech.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340]   You can think about banks, retailers,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.520]   small and medium businesses.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.900]   So who here is in each group?
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.380]   Who here is at a tech company?
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.260]   Who here is at a verticalized or services company?
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.540]   Who here is in tech enabled?
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.260]   Okay, pretty good mix.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.820]   Now each of these different companies
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.400]   have different challenges.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.840]   Typically in a technology company
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.060]   where we've seen blunders is the lack of domain knowledge
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.400]   when launching a product,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.700]   there's usually some kind of business
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.620]   misalignment with technology.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.440]   In the middle, either everything goes right
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.860]   or everything goes awfully poorly.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.140]   And on the tech enabled side,
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.880]   there's usually some kind of tech challenge, right?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.320]   Because tech is not your core value proposition.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.760]   So you make different decisions based on this, right?
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.820]   You typically buy data or buy expertise
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.300]   if you're a tech company, right?
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.280]   You go to a vendor and say, give me label data.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   In the middle, you either have everything
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.960]   or you have nothing.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.260]   And from a tech enabled company,
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.480]   you usually buy technology,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.880]   either through a service provider
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   or a true intent solution.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.100]   Now I bring this up because every company,
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.920]   every organization and every person
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.960]   has a different perspective on the role of technology
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.460]   solving our world's problems.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.220]   This is my stance.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.820]   I think we have 90% of the technology
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.780]   to solve the problems of humanity.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now this might be a controversial perspective,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.120]   but I'll show you why.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   The fax market still exists.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.740]   Billions of dollars are spent on faxes.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.760]   And the market is growing.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.700]   In 2017, only 3% of payments in the US were contactless.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.680]   That number is now higher,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.620]   but we're still paying in archaic ways.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.660]   Checks are still a massive part of the market.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.540]   And it took 40 years after the introduction
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420]   of personal computing of the internet
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.940]   for medical systems and electronic medical records
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.360]   to become digital.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.580]   This number is much higher now,
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.640]   but it takes time for technology to be adopted.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.620]   And many of you might have seen this in your industry,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.460]   in your job as well,
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.600]   that technology is not the thing
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.540]   that's stopping you from achieving success.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.140]   So this is the core question.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.560]   Is technology the limitation of our success?
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.800]   And it's not about technology is how we use technology.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.040]   And the way you build your team should reflect this
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.940]   by understanding the problems that you have.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.200]   So going to this question of,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.440]   do you need to hire an AI researcher?
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.060]   A lot of times when ChatGPT was coming out,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.920]   every team is like, I need an AI engineer,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.300]   I need an AI researcher,
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.280]   and it's not always smart to do so, right?
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.660]   Up until you hit a certain scale
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.460]   or a certain need of specialty,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.460]   it does not make sense to hire an AI researcher
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.860]   to work on models.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.060]   Free training models,
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.200]   even fine tuning models of a certain capacity
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.880]   is not necessarily the first thing that you need
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.460]   to achieve the value that you need to get.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.520]   There's a lot of transformation work
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.900]   that goes in before that.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.220]   Now in certain domains, the best tech is essential, right?
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.920]   So if you're working at OpenAI or a model provider,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.840]   Anthropic, Google, or some of the startups,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.420]   you want the best team who's working on that,
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.280]   'cause that is a product as we covered.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.240]   So here I'll propose a wager for you.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.960]   Are people here familiar with Pascal's wager philosophy?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.040]   I'll give you the successor of that Ampere's wager
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.140]   if you're familiar with graphics card architectures.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.860]   Here's your trade.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.580]   You trade your team for five researchers from the top labs.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.940]   And maybe you need to throw in some cash
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.040]   and first round picks for that as well.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.300]   But do you make this trade?
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.800]   Do you trade your team that has domain knowledge,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.600]   has worked in the area for five AI researchers?
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.080]   I want you to think about that.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.520]   So we go back to the question of what does an AI team need to do?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.360]   There's a lot of stuff, right?
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.840]   Start off with defining use cases.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.380]   We want to go through and integrate with products, right?
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.060]   We're not doing greenfield everywhere.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.700]   We want to measure ROI, find the right data.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.740]   We want to test and refine workflows,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.740]   build the interfaces we need for success,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.020]   sell this product, and make our customers care.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.500]   And it's not one person who does this job.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.460]   You can't just say, AI researchers,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.720]   go make me $10 million from this product unless a very specific niche.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.580]   So this means your success is not one job, unless you're a founder, but we'll skip that.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.180]   So the goal here is that you need to have a comprehensive AI team,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.180]   and you need to figure out how you're going to structure that.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.620]   And the thing that we need to remember is that companies aren't just one team.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.260]   It's not just my AI team owns this small segment, this deployment, or whatever.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.980]   Otherwise, you ship your org chart, and you get some weird product behaviors.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.820]   So identify to yourself, what is your bottleneck?
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.740]   What is stopping you from achieving success?
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.100]   Is it shipping features?
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.140]   Is it acquiring users?
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.260]   Is it retaining users?
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.900]   Are you monetizing correctly?
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.900]   Are there scalability issues?
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.820]   Are there reliability and observability issues?
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.260]   All of us have probably run into these things as we were deploying AI products,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.860]   so we need to make sure we can prioritize all these things and hire accordingly.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.900]   And these are all questions that you need to answer when building an AI team.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.740]   The key takeaway here is, what kind of team do you need?
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.340]   And only you know that answer.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.060]   Let's talk about generalists and why I think they're important.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.020]   So in 2021, I was building a first machine learning team,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.300]   and I adopted an approach where we hired generalists,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.820]   and we supported them by automation across the board.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.140]   So at the time, I was hired to a conversational AI company working on a platform.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.420]   Sorry, let me rephrase that.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.700]   AI agent building platform.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.980]   I just wanted to make sure you guys understood what that meant.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.020]   And I was hired with the mandate of we want ML.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.700]   That was my job description.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.420]   Change that.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.020]   We want AI.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.660]   So after working with the business teams and leadership team, this was the final set of goals we set.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.140]   We want to serve hundreds of thousands of concurrent models.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.260]   It needs to be multi-domain.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.220]   It has to be low cost.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.140]   And we want to support real-time training and serving.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.060]   Those are some tough goals.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.460]   So this is what we did.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.580]   We wrote a custom ML Ops platform for deployments to match our requirements.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.660]   We mainly fine-tuned encoder models.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.020]   We built RAG as a service.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.260]   And as a team, we own six microservices on 10.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.900]   So the three areas I focused on building the team was model training, model serving, and business acumen.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.540]   Now, you might say, I want top grades in all these things, but that's a lot of money, right?
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.180]   And as a team leader, as somebody who manages the budget, you don't have infinite money.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.460]   So we have to pick along this axis, where do we want each of these skills to lie?
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.140]   For model training, we don't want somebody at the very bottom, but we don't need somebody who can train GPT-3.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.980]   And basically, we went across and said, okay, what are the key requirements?
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.420]   For model training, we said somebody in the upper half who knows general architectures of models,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.220]   can do encoder fine-tuning, does some data engineering, using hugging face is okay.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.180]   That was the bar we set.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.300]   On the model serving perspective, on the first round, I was the first engineer at the company.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.220]   I spent a lot of time on building the ML platform.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.420]   But that was something I was comfortable with coming from a cloud engineering background.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.740]   Now, after that, there was enough abstraction built in that we didn't need somebody who knew
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.380]   the intricacies of how Kubernetes works and how we did serving or training, but the capability to use
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.820]   these abstractions and understand the trade-offs that were being made.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.660]   And what I did focus on is the ability of our engineers to get on calls with customers, right?
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.340]   We didn't need a business development rep who would just cold call people for fun.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.740]   But we need engineers who didn't say my job is coding in a basement.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.300]   So we went through and understood these trade-offs that needed to happen.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:25.620]   In 2024, I was building another team, the new organization that I joined, and similar approach,
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.260]   but open source had advanced. When I was building the original ML platform, we didn't have things like
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.820]   shadow deployments or A/B testing on a lot of the platforms that existed, and we had a specific use case.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:41.140]   Now, since then, what's important to recognize is that all these skills that you're prioritizing
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.900]   don't necessarily need to be one person. They can be multiple people. You just have to find a way to
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:53.460]   make the team work. So once again, we set similar structures. And in this case, because open source
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.580]   had advanced in a number of different ways and commercial malls had advanced, some of the things
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.100]   shifted around. On the training side, using commercial APIs and prompt tuning and model fine tuning
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.740]   commercial models became important, but we also expanded our scope. We're now using decoder and
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.140]   encoder models, which each have their nuances. On the serving side, because we're using an open source
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.420]   offering, we didn't need to write our own platform, which is nice. And on the domain side, again, because
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.060]   of the nature of our business of doing medical record processing, there's a whole nuance of what
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:33.940]   that domain knowledge was. So that bar increased in a different way. So now that we know what kind
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.660]   of skills we need for our team, we can identify this threshold and balance the budget, right? We can't
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   just ask for infinite money unless you're a specific subset of companies. You might have this question,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:50.420]   what if I already have a team? I have 40 people, 100 people, what do I do? How do I reskill, upskill?
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.700]   How do I manage this team? So we need to figure out what the goal of the team is, as we were referring
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:01.700]   to. And I typically like to think about it through inner and outer loops. So inner loops are the daily
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:07.620]   activities that the team needs to accomplish together every day to be successful. And the outer loop is the
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.100]   broader set of activities that will set you apart. And you might not need constant interaction with that,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.460]   but they're really important. So in my current team, this is how we typically structure it.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.380]   So we have model training, prompting, product requirements, model serving, some domain experts,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.820]   and the capability to build business cases as the core nucleus of our team.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.340]   And again, as you're building your team and your function within your domain, these will be different,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.380]   but this is a framework to understand what are my priorities. And we need to have the expertise
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.140]   in our outer loop as well to further differentiate our company and our team.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.340]   And if you have a weak technical loop on the inside, you're going to struggle with the technical
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.420]   execution. If you have a weak domain loop, you're not going to find product market fit.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.980]   So you need to make sure that you really understand those feedback loops and the collaboration loops
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.580]   that exist within your company.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.420]   Now, depending where you are at the stage of your AI strategy, all of us fall on a different spectrum.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.900]   You win with different types of people. You win with generalists at the beginning when you're
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.780]   trying to find that fit, trying to make that basic progress until you get to the point where you exhaust
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.180]   the knowledge and you need to move into a more specialist model.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.260]   So once again, on the general side, most companies as they're going through transformation fall in
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.220]   that category. Once you get to a really good stage for your model training, serving and so forth,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.140]   you need specialists to push the extra 5% of performance there.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:37.940]   So generally, my perspective is generalists are good because they're adaptable. And in most cases,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.260]   you're good enough with a generalist who can do many different things beyond just writing code.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.340]   Let's talk about upskilling, reskilling, and hiring.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:54.980]   So I think there are three main things as we continue to go through this AI wave that you need to do.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.540]   People need to learn to build, you need to become a domain expert, and you need to be human facing.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:05.220]   So we've talked about vibe coding and prototyping. We should go from static product requirements to
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.340]   functional prototypes that take those details and elicit them. We never want to have those
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.460]   conversations again, those dreaded conversations with PMs and engineers being like that wasn't in the
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.900]   requirements or that wasn't an edge case. We want to shorten that feedback loop. We want to make sure
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.900]   that people are writing evaluations, that domain experts aren't just providing input and feedback,
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:30.180]   that they're the ones writing the use cases, defining them, and having the literacy to work with
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.980]   elements directly. We need to make sure that engineers are on customer calls so we shorten those
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:41.540]   feedback loops. If your engineers say sorry I can't talk to a customer, that's a learning opportunity.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:48.740]   Finally, you need somebody to sell your product. Now the way my team works is that we have weekly
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.460]   cadences to learn. Every week we have a new topic either with myself or other members of the team that
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.340]   is brought to the table for 30 minutes and we learn the underlying key priorities of our team and our
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:04.740]   company. And we make sure that every week we're upskilling ourselves. If this sounds intense, the consequences of not doing this are much
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:12.660]   much higher. Let's close out on hiring. When do you need to hire? I believe that people need to be hired for
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:19.300]   two main reasons. One is to hold context and the other is to act on context. So it's important that if you have too few
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.900]   people on your team, things are getting dropped and you can't execute on your priorities. You might ask the question,
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.060]   can't AI agents with a massive context window do this? Maybe to some extent, but you need expertise
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.900]   to be able to verify that this context and this execution is correct. And to have expertise, you need
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:43.060]   to have context. And finally, humans should be accountable for the systems that we build, as we have in the old IBM
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:50.980]   quote, right, we can't hold a machine accountable. So who do you who do you need to hire? So we're hiring on a budget.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.420]   And going back to everything that we've talked about today, you need to know your team composition and
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.060]   the needs that you have to set up this budget, right? If you're trying to hire the top researcher, it's going
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.540]   to be very expensive. If you're going to hire a generalist AI engineer, we'll be quite a bit cheaper.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.500]   Now, it's also important when you're hiring is that you're not just following trends.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.900]   Who here has heard the trend that junior engineers shouldn't be hired or just using AI agents?
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.940]   Okay, some people are asleep.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:29.540]   Now, the counterpoint here is why is YC running a school, an AI school for students and young people
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:35.300]   on AI? 2,000 people coming to San Francisco in two weeks. Why are they doing that? Certainly entry level
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.420]   positions. If they were useless, they wouldn't be bringing in all these young people. So make sure
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.220]   that you verify the trends that you're seeing and think from first principles. What do I need?
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.980]   What is the team composition? Is it new grads? Is it people with 30 years of experience? What are the
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.820]   retraining opportunities, right? There's lots of ways to build a great team.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:02.740]   Now, just repeating this because I've seen so many companies do this, ask relevant questions to the job,
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.100]   stop putting people through lead codes that have nothing to do with the job.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.940]   And now that LLMs can solve it, it's not a great way to evaluate either.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:18.820]   So we go back to Ampere's wager. You have the question of, am I going to have five researchers
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:25.380]   from the top labs? Or am I going to build my team in a domain specific way? So for example, in my company,
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.420]   I'd rather have the team on the left with the domain expertise, the ability to sell, work, have empathy
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.060]   with customers, rather than just having five researchers. That's the way that our domain and
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:41.060]   company are structured. Now, you can also answer Blackwell's wager, which is do you want GPUs or a
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:50.260]   team? So that's a story for another day. So overall, we have three main lessons from today. The first one is,
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:55.860]   it's important to start off from the beginning and say, what team do you need to win? Once you know that,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.260]   you'll start noticing that cross-functional teams will continue to be effective, but they'll be built in
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.740]   different ways. The overlap will be greater, but all of us will have the opportunity to work with AI
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:11.300]   systems and contribute to our product. And finally, we need to continue learning. This is a must, right?
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.140]   The world moves too quickly. We have Pelican evaluations now for the past six months rather
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.860]   than the past year, right? Hopefully, that's an illustration of how fast the world works as well.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.300]   So keep up to date, keep moving, make it part of your culture to keep learning. So thanks, everybody,
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.100]   for joining. These are my handles if you want to connect afterwards, and I'll be here
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:39.460]   later on if you have any more questions. Thank you.
