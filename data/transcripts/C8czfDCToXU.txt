[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Psalm 16.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.760]   A miktam of David.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.420]   Keep me, O God, for I take refuge in you.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.140]   O my soul, you have said to Yahweh,
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.380]   you are my Lord.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.020]   I have no good without you.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320]   As for the saints who are in the earth,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.020]   they are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.520]   The pains of those who have bartered
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.440]   for another God will be multiplied.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.400]   I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.880]   nor will I take their names upon my lips.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.220]   Yahweh is the portion of my inheritance and my cup.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.880]   You support my lot.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.660]   The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.140]   Indeed, my inheritance is beautiful to me.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.100]   I will bless Yahweh who has counseled me.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.900]   Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.300]   I have set Yahweh continually before me.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.320]   Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoices.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.920]   My flesh also will dwell securely.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.000]   For you will not forsake my soul to Sheol.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.920]   You will not give your Holy One over to see corruption.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.240]   You will make known to me the path of life.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.700]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   In your right hand, there are pleasures forever.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.860]   (silence)
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:57.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
