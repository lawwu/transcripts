[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:41.000]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, one of my missions is to understand, identify, and elucidate
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.480]   for you the fundamental principles and philosophies of personal finance and wealth.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.440]   Principles and philosophies are those things that do not change over time.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.880]   Tactics and techniques may change, but principles do not change.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.840]   They are constant throughout time.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.880]   They are constant throughout the earth.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.800]   They are true things regardless of context.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.400]   I love to find and pull apart these principles in old writings or from cultures that are
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   not my own.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.720]   Today, I have a treat for you.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.400]   I'm going to share with you an essay written by Benjamin Franklin in the year 1757.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.120]   It's called The Way to Wealth.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.040]   I think you'll find that 250 years have not dimmed the value of these underlying principles.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.300]   This essay is a collection of adages and advice that was presented by Franklin in his Poor
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.080]   Richard's Almanac for the first 25 years of publication.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.520]   He's organized it in this essay into a speech given by a man named Father Abraham to a group
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   of people.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.600]   I hope you'll find it useful.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.560]   I think this type of story or parable is a particularly effective way of learning because
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.120]   it forces you to take and understand the principles discussed in a different context to your own,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.380]   and then to translate them to your own context.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.000]   The great problem and deficit or deficiency of speaking always on tactics and techniques,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.760]   such as, "Well, if you want to get rich, put money in a Roth IRA," the great deficiency
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.280]   of this method is, if you don't have access to a Roth IRA, you no longer know what to
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280]   do.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.080]   Perhaps your income grew to the point where you can't contribute.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.400]   And if all you knew was a tactic or a technique, then you're like a fish out of water not
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.720]   knowing what to do.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.520]   But if you can understand the underlying principle or philosophy, in this case, the principle
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.760]   is frugality, the minimization of expenses, especially the expenses of taxes, then when
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.880]   your income rises to the point that you can no longer participate in a Roth IRA, you are
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.200]   not left without knowledge of what to do.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.840]   You're just simply looking for the next tool, the next tactic or technique that will help
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.800]   you to accomplish the same purpose, namely, lowering expenses, lowering investment expenses,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.040]   and especially minimizing the expense of taxes.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.080]   So allow me to step back and allow Benjamin Franklin to teach you today.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.920]   Benjamin Franklin, The Way to Wealth.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.560]   Courteous Reader, I have heard that nothing gives an author so great pleasure as to find
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.640]   his works respectfully quoted by other learned authors.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.320]   This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed, for though I have been, if I may say it without vanity,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   an eminent author of almanacs annually now a full quarter of a century, my brother-authors
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.160]   in the same way, for what reason I know not, have ever been very sparing in their applauses,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.840]   and no other author has taken the least notice of me.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.760]   So that did not my writings produce me some solid pudding, the great deficiency of praise
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.400]   would have quite discouraged me.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.480]   I concluded at length that the people were the best judges of my merit, for they buy
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.880]   my works, and besides, in my rambles where I am not personally known, I have frequently
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.920]   heard one or other of my adages repeated with, as poor Richard says, at the end on it, this
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.640]   gave me some satisfaction, as it showed not only that my instructions were regarded, but
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.780]   discovered likewise some respect for my authority.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.520]   And I own that to encourage the practice of remembering and repeating those wise sentences,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.720]   I have sometimes quoted myself with great gravity.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.320]   Judge then how much I must have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.520]   I stopped my horse lately where a great number of people were collected at a vendue of merchant
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.120]   goods, the hour of sale not being come, they were conversing on the badness of the times,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.720]   and one of the company called to a plain, clean old man with white locks, "Pray, Father
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   Abraham, what think you of the times?
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.560]   Won't these heavy taxes quite ruin the country?
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.280]   How shall we be ever able to pay them?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.080]   What would you advise us to do?"
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.800]   Father Abraham stood up and replied, "If you'd have my advice, I'll give it to you
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.320]   in short, for a word to the wise is enough, and many words won't fill a bushel," as
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.560]   poor Richard says.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.240]   They joined in desiring him to speak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.840]   "Friends," says he, "and neighbors, the taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.640]   them.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.760]   But we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.360]   We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.920]   times as much by our folly, and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.600]   us by allowing an abatement.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.800]   However, let us hearken to good advice, and something may be done for us.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   God helps them that help themselves," as poor Richard says in his Almanac of 1733.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.820]   It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one-tenth part of their
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.680]   time to be employed in its service, but idleness taxes many of us much more.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.000]   If we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   is spent in idle employments, or amusements that amount to nothing, sloth by bringing
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.800]   on diseases absolutely shortens life.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.280]   Sloth like rust consumes faster than labor, wears, while the used key is always bright,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.120]   as poor Richard says.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.380]   But dost thou love life?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.320]   Then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of, as poor Richard says.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.640]   How much more, then, is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that "the sleeping
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   fox catches no poultry," and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave, as poor
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.540]   Richard says.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:01.840]   If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be, as poor Richard says,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.760]   the greatest prodigality, since, as he elsewhere tells us, lost time is never found again,
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.840]   and what we call "time enough" always proves "little enough."
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   Let us then be up and be doing, and doing to the purpose, so by diligence shall we do
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   more with less perplexity.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:31.380]   Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy, as poor Richard says, and he that
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:38.840]   riseth late must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his business at night, while laziness
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.760]   travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in poor Richard, who adds,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   Drive thy business, let not that drive thee, and early to bed and early to rise makes a
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.880]   So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times?
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.000]   We may make these times better if we bestir ourselves.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.960]   Industry need not wish, as poor Richard says, and he that lives upon hope will die fasting.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.980]   There are no gains without pains, then help hands, for I have no lands, or if I have they
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.080]   are smartly taxed.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.480]   And as poor Richard likewise observes, he that hath a trade hath an estate, and he that
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.960]   hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.480]   But then the trade must be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.940]   estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.320]   If we are industrious, we shall never starve, for, as poor Richard says, at the working
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   man's house hunger looks in, but dares not enter.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:00.280]   Nor will the bailiff nor the constable enter, for industry pays debts while despair increaseth
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.840]   them, says poor Richard.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.760]   What though you have found no treasure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, diligence
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.080]   is the mother of good luck, as poor Richard says, and God gives all things to industry.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:22.260]   Then plow deep while sluggards sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and to keep, says
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.180]   poor Dick.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.080]   Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-morrow,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.600]   which makes poor Richard say, One to-day is worth two to-morrows.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.080]   And farther, have you some what to do to-morrow?
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.720]   Do it to-day.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.960]   If you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle?
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   Are you then your own master?
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.520]   Be ashamed to catch yourself idle, when there is so much to be done for yourself, your family,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.380]   your country, and your gracious king.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.380]   Be up by peep of day.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.740]   Let not the sun look down and say, In glorious here he lies.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.620]   Handle your tools without mittens.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.980]   Remember that the cat in gloves catches no mice, as poor Richard says.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.020]   'Tis true there is much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed, but stick to
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   it steadily, and you will see great effects, for constant dropping wears away stones, and
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:31.140]   by diligence and patience the mouse ate into the cable, and little strokes fell great oaks,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.260]   as poor Richard says in his almanac, the year I cannot just now remember.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.220]   Methinks I hear some of you say, Must a man afford himself no leisure?
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.580]   I will tell thee, my friend, what poor Richard says.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:50.380]   Enjoy thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure, and since thou art not sure of a
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.340]   minute, throw not away an hour.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.420]   Leisure is time for doing something useful.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.260]   This leisure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:09.420]   So that, as poor Richard says, a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.180]   Do you imagine that sloth will afford you more comfort than labor?
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:21.180]   No, for as poor Richard says, trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.580]   ease.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:29.340]   Many without labor would live by their wits only, but they break for want of stock, whereas
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.740]   industry gives comfort and plenty and respect.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.380]   Fly pleasures, and they'll follow you.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.700]   The diligent spinner has a large shift, and now I have a sheep and a cow.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.720]   He bids me good morrow, all which is well said by poor Richard.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:54.480]   But with our industry we must likewise be steady, settled, and careful, and oversee
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.100]   our own affairs with our own eyes, and not trust too much to others.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:06.620]   For as poor Richard says, I never saw an oft-removed tree, nor yet an oft-removed family, that
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.420]   throve so well as those that settled be.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.260]   And again, three removes are as bad as a fire.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.780]   And again, keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:25.380]   And again, if you would have your business done, go, if not, send.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:33.180]   And again, he that by the plow would thrive, himself must either hold or drive.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.420]   And again, the eye of a master will do more work than both his hands.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.620]   And again, want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:51.320]   And again, not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.140]   Trusting too much to others' care is the ruin of many.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:14:00.300]   For, as the almanac says, in the affairs of this world men are saved not by faith, but
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.500]   by the want of it.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.300]   But a man's own care is profitable.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:12.500]   For saith poor Dick, learning is to the studious, and riches to the careful, as well as power
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.340]   to the bold, and heaven to the virtuous.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:23.480]   And farther, if you would have a faithful servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.700]   And again, he adviseth to circumspection and care, even in the smallest matters, because
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.220]   sometimes a little neglect may breed great mischief.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.980]   Adding, for want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.340]   for want of a horse the rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the enemy, all for
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.500]   want of care about a horse-shoe nail.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.160]   So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own business.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.700]   But to these we must add frugality, if we would make our industry more certainly successful.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   A man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep his nose all his life to the
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.820]   grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:19.060]   A fat kitchen makes a lean will, as poor Richard says, and many estates are spent in the getting,
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:27.340]   since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting, and men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:33.220]   If you would be wealthy, says he in another almanac, think of saving as well as of getting.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:39.380]   The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her outgoes are greater than her incomes.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.460]   Away then with your expensive follies, and you will not have so much cause to complain
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:50.700]   of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families, for as poor Dick says, women and
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:57.120]   wine, game and deceit, make the wealth small and the wants great.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.620]   And farther, what maintains one vice would bring up two children.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.980]   You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.400]   more costly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.280]   no great matter.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.420]   But remember what poor Richard says, many a little makes a mickle, and farther, beware
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:29.300]   of little expenses, a small leak will sink a great ship, and again, who dainties love
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:37.940]   shall beggars prove, and moreover, fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:43.380]   Here you are all got together at this vendue of fineries and knick-knacks.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:49.500]   You call them goods, but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.740]   You expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may for less than they cost, but if you
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.740]   have no occasion for them, they must be dear to you.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:06.420]   Remember what poor Richard says, buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.980]   sell thy necessaries.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.420]   And again, at a great penny worth, pause a while.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:19.380]   He means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real, or the bargain by straightening
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.980]   thee and thy business may do thee more harm than good.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:30.100]   For in another place he says, many have been ruined by buying good pennies worths.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.140]   Again poor Richard says, 'tis foolish to lay our money in a purchase of repentance,
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:42.300]   and yet this folly is practiced every day at vendues, for want of minding the almanac.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:50.820]   Wise men, as poor Dick says, learn by others' harms, fools scarcely by their own.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.740]   But Felix quem facunti aliena pericula cautum.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:04.060]   Many a one, for the sake of finery on the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and half-starved
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.140]   their families.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:14.660]   Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, as poor Richard says, put out the kitchen fire.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.840]   These are not the necessaries of life.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.620]   They can scarcely be called the conveniences, and yet only because they look pretty, how
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.820]   many want to have them.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.060]   The artificial wants of mankind thus become more numerous than the natural, and as poor
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.940]   Dick says, for one poor person there are an hundred indigent.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:43.820]   By these and other extravagancies the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.880]   of those whom they formerly despised.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.180]   But who through industry and frugality have maintained their standing?
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.760]   In which case it appears plainly that a plowman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.580]   his knees, as poor Richard says.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.760]   Perhaps they have had a small estate left them, which they knew not the getting of.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.200]   They think, 'Tis day and will never be night, that a little to be spent out of so much is
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.820]   not worth minding.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.400]   A child and a fool, as poor Richard says, imagine twenty shillings and twenty years
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.300]   can never be spent.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:26.140]   But always taking out of the meal tub and never putting in soon comes to the bottom.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.240]   Even as poor Dick says, when the wells dry they know the worth of water.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.720]   But this they might have known before if they had taken his advice.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.980]   If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some, for he that goes a borrowing
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.220]   goes a sorrowing.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:48.180]   And indeed so does he that lends to such people, when he goes to get it in again.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:55.020]   Poor Dick farther advises and says, 'Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.040]   Where fancy you consult, consult your purse.'
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.780]   And again, 'Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a great deal more saucy.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.040]   When you have bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appearance may be
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.720]   all of a piece.'
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.580]   But poor Dick says, 'Tis easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.520]   follow it.'
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.480]   And 'Tis as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to swell in
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.680]   order to equal the ox.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.800]   Great estates may venture more, but little boats should keep near shore.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:44.160]   'Tis however a folly soon punished, for pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt.'
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.120]   As poor Richard says.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.960]   And in another place, 'Pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and supped
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.880]   with infamy.'
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.080]   And after all, of what use is this pride of appearance, for which so much is risked, so
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.500]   much is suffered?
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.260]   It cannot promote health or ease pain.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.960]   It makes no increase of merit in the person.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.720]   It creates envy.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.520]   It hastens misfortune.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.460]   What is a butterfly?
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.940]   At best he's but a caterpillar dressed.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.960]   The gaudy fop's his picture just, as poor Richard says.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.260]   But what madness must it be to run in debt for these superfluities?
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.220]   We are offered by the terms of this vendue six months' credit, and that perhaps has
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.060]   induced some of us to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready money, and hope now
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.280]   to be fine without it.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   But ah, think what you do when you run in debt.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.460]   You give to another power over your liberty.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.980]   If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see your creditor.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.280]   You will be in fear when you speak to him.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:58.520]   You will make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by degrees come to lose your veracity,
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.000]   and sink into base, downright lying.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.640]   For as poor Richard says, 'The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt.'
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.200]   And again to the same purpose, 'Lying rides upon debt's back.'
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.780]   For as a free-born Englishman ought not to be ashamed, or afraid to see or speak to any
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:26.120]   man living, but poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.060]   'Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright, as poor Richard truly says.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.160]   What would you think of that prince, or that government, who should issue an edict forbidding
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   you to dress like a gentleman, or a gentlewoman, on pain of imprisonment or servitude?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.780]   Would you not say that you are free, have a right to dress as you please, and that such
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:53.820]   an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and such a government tyrannical?
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.600]   And yet you are about to put yourself under that tyranny when you run in debt for such
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.000]   dress.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.160]   Your creditor has authority at his pleasure to deprive you of your liberty by confining
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.620]   you in gaol for life, or to sell you for a servant if you should not be able to pay him.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:17.420]   When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but creditors, poor
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.080]   Richard tells us, have better memories than detours.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:31.420]   And in another place, creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.300]   The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.320]   to satisfy it.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.200]   Or if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at first seemed so long will, as it
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.280]   lessens, appear extremely short.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.360]   Time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as shoulders.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.880]   Those have a short lent, saith poor Richard, who owe money to be paid at Easter.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.200]   Then since, as he says, the borrower is a slave to the lender, and the debtor to the
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   creditor, disdain the chain, preserve your freedom, and maintain your independency.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.620]   Be industrious and free, be frugal and free.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.760]   At present, perhaps, you may think yourself in thriving circumstances, and that you can
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:31.120]   bear a little extravagance without injury; but for age and want, save while you may,
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.520]   no morning sun lasts a whole day, as poor Richard says.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:44.960]   Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever while you live, expense is constant and certain.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:52.040]   And 'tis easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel, as poor Richard says.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.880]   So rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.080]   Get what you can and what you get hold.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:06.960]   'Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold, as poor Richard says.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.020]   And when you have got the philosopher's stone, sure, you will no longer complain of
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.720]   bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.600]   This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.280]   But after all, do not depend too much upon your own industry and frugality and prudence,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.100]   though excellent things, for they may all be blasted without the blessing of heaven.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:40.240]   And therefore ask that blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that at present
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.800]   seem to want it, but comfort and help them.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   Remember, Job suffered and was afterwards prosperous.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.520]   And now to conclude, experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.720]   And scarce in that, for it is true.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.320]   We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct, as poor Richard says.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.080]   However, remember this, they that won't be counseled can't be helped, as poor Richard
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:20.200]   says, and farther, that if you will not hear reason, she'll surely rap your knuckles.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.820]   Thus, the old gentleman ended his harangue.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.040]   The people heard it and approved the doctrine and immediately practiced the contrary, just
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.780]   as if it had been a common sermon.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:39.000]   For the vendue opened, and they began to buy extravagantly, notwithstanding all his cautions
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.320]   and their own fear of taxes.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   I found the good man had thoroughly studied my almanacs and digested all I had dropped
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.440]   on those topics during the course of five and twenty years.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.280]   The frequent mention he made of me must have tired anyone else, but my vanity was wonderfully
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.960]   delighted with it, though I was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.640]   own which he ascribed to me, but rather the gleanings I had made of the sense of all ages
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.840]   and nations.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.140]   However, I resolved to be the better for the echo of it, and though I had at first determined
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:20.720]   to buy stuff for a new coat, I went away, resolved to wear my old one a little longer.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.800]   Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit will be as great as mine.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.680]   I am, as ever, thine to serve thee.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:36.120]   July 7, 1757.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   Thank you for listening.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.320]   You have honored me with your time and attention, and I am grateful for that.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.600]   And I hope that I have effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.860]   tactics and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.320]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:59.000]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.040]   action on it.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.440]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.780]   to a life change.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.760]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.400]   So take action.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:20.080]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.680]   that you care about.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:28.840]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.320]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:37.160]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:43.960]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.280]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.000]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640]   this work voluntarily.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.880]   Come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and you can sign up there to support the show
