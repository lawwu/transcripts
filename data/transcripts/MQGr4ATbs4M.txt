[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Even though it would be very stupid for Putin to escalate, I could imagine him doing very stupid things.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.960]   Well, let's put stupid out of it, because it's not explanatory by saying,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.240]   "Well, someone's stupid," because it means you write off understanding their reasoning.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   Putin, he has no back down plan.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.880]   He only has a double down plan.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.680]   Expect him to double down forever.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.040]   And then the question is whether all the oligarchs want to keep doubling down with him and his generals,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.640]   or whether they give him something extra in his Cheerios some morning, who knows?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.840]   I feel like this is one of the lessons you were actually talking about earlier,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.080]   where you don't want somebody to feel like they're up against the wall,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.800]   where even if it would be an unjust sort of resolution, some sort of ceasefire where Putin can stay face,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160]   I wonder if your sort of historical lessons would bring you to that conclusion.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.000]   Putin, he will be back for more.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.480]   What is the solution? We can't have unconditional surrender.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.760]   No, no, no one's marching into Moscow.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.840]   The United States has done this for many years, is you don't recognize the territories that he's taken,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.480]   which means the Russians are stuck with a sanctioned regime of some type.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360]   It will depress Russian growth forever.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.840]   Some Russians said, "Oh no, we are going to be like North Korea."
