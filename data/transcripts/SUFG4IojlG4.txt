[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.040]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter and the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.560]   The seventeenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.920]   For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.840]   And I want particularly this morning to deal with the word "came".
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:42.440]   The law was given by or through Moses, but grace and truth came by or through Jesus Christ.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.100]   Now in our study of this verse we have seen very clearly that the law points both to grace
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.560]   and to truth.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640]   We can go further, and we have indeed been going further, and we can say that the law
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.080]   not only points to grace and truth, the law demands grace and truth if we are to be saved.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.520]   But I want to go a step further still this morning, and that is to say that the law demands
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.480]   that grace and truth should come, and that they should come in a person, and come in
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.440]   the exact way and manner in which actually they have come and did come when the Son of
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   God entered into this world.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.120]   Now this verse as we have seen is full of contrasts, and there is this particular contrast
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.700]   as we were looking at last Sunday morning in general between Moses and the Lord Jesus
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.740]   Christ.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.760]   And in addition to the things we enumerated then, we can add this, that Moses was not
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   really essential to the law.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.000]   The law was given through Moses, but it could have been given through many others.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.340]   Moses was not a vital part of it.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.460]   Some representative, some kind of mediator was necessary, some kind of leader, and God
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.480]   chose this particular man, Moses.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.860]   But as I say, Moses was not absolutely essential, though he was a great man and an unusual man.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.680]   And we have seen in looking at that first verse in the epistle to the Hebrews that God
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.400]   gave that revelation under the Old Testament and dispensation in many parts and in many
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   forms and at many times.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.800]   And he had a succession of prophets, and to each one of them was given a part and a portion.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.500]   Now in not a single case was the particular man absolutely essential.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.840]   What I mean by that is that they were but the vehicles and the channels and the instruments
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.960]   used by God through whom the revelation was given.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   And thus we find a great variety in their characters, in their abilities, in their offices,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   and in their works.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   But now when we come to this other realm, we find that grace and truth came through
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.740]   Jesus Christ.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.160]   And what I want to try to demonstrate this morning is that grace and truth could only
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.600]   come through him, and in the particular and precise way and manner in which they came.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.680]   Moses, not essential.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.640]   Jesus Christ, absolutely essential.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.240]   And without him and apart from him, grace and truth could not have come at all.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   Now then, the question is, why?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.200]   Well the answer can be put in general in one phrase by putting it like this.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.520]   The law, by revealing our state and condition and needs, shows that nothing but the incarnation
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.480]   and all that followed it would suffice.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.160]   The law, I say, by exposing the exceeding sinfulness of sin and our guilt and our impotence
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.480]   and so on, the law really demands the God-man.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.920]   It demands, as I say, the incarnation and everything that followed.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.440]   It demands what is put here in these words, that the Word was made flesh and should dwell
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.880]   among us.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.360]   It demands the coming of the Son of God from the everlasting glory in the precise manner
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.720]   in which he came, and that he should do all that he did.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.000]   Very well then, let's try to analyze this and to examine it together this morning.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.680]   So my first statement is this, to explain why the truth had to come in this particular
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.920]   way and manner through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   Now we saw last Sunday morning that he alone, who as verse 18 tells us is in the bosom of
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.320]   the Father, the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father and there in the
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.600]   most intimate relationship sharing all the secrets and having a complete and entire knowledge.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.720]   We saw clearly that he alone could exegete, expound, draw out, lead out the Father to
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   us.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.840]   No man could ever do this.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.720]   No man hath seen or ever can see God in any sense at any time, not merely physical, but
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.200]   it includes a real knowledge and understanding of God and of his being.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:12.760]   That is where all philosophy, as I explained, ultimately is not only foolish but is arrogant.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's attempting something that by definition is a sheer impossibility.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.240]   But here we see that the Son came.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:31.680]   He is the fullness of the Father and therefore he really can tell us the truth about God.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   In other words, God alone can reveal God.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   No man by searching can find out God.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.360]   The world by wisdom knew not God, of course not, can't.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.520]   We are not only sinful, we are finite, and God is infinite.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:53.560]   Very well, so that we start with this essential postulate that it is only the only begotten
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.320]   Son who is in the bosom of the Father who can declare him.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.200]   But immediately you see a problem arises.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   We are told in the Old Testament that no man can see God and live.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.240]   Now therein lies the problem.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   God alone can reveal God, but man can't look upon God and still go on living because
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   God is God.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   Now there is the problem.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.160]   It is a problem, I say, that is really postulated by the law, which shows us our utter inability,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   having revealed to us something of the being and the character and the holiness and the
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.720]   justice and the righteousness of God.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.440]   The law tells us that it is idle to try to arrive at a knowledge of God.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.720]   It shuts us entirely up to a revelation by God himself.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.780]   But here is our difficulty.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.300]   We can't look upon God and live.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:57.040]   Now let me elaborate this point by showing you how this gives us a real key to the understanding
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.880]   of the Incarnation and shows us why it was absolutely essential that grace and truthâ€”that
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   truth had to come.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.240]   The truth can't be stated to us merely.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.160]   It must come, it must appear.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.140]   We'll never know God until in some shape or form or manner we see God.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.640]   But we can't look upon God as we are by nature and live.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.920]   Now I want to give you some further illustrations of this, just to show why it was absolutely
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.120]   essential that the Son of God should be born as a baby in Bethlehem, why the word must
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.280]   be made flesh before we could have any knowledge of truth.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.480]   There are some very interesting glimpses given into this problem in the Bible itself.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.000]   Take for instance what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.260]   There you remember our Lord took with him Peter and James and John and went up into
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:59.400]   that mountain, and he was transfigured before, so that his very clothes became glistening
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:05.960]   and white, brighter than the work of any fuller can ever achieve.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.240]   There he was, as it were, suddenly transfigured, and his glory began to appear.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.240]   And this is what we read.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.440]   It's only Luke who gives us the detail.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.360]   It's a very important one.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.560]   In the ninth chapter of Luke's Gospel we read something like this in verses 32 and
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   34.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:28.480]   "But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep."
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.040]   Why were they heavy with sleep?
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.680]   Oh, it was this dazzling glory that was having that effect upon them.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.720]   Then I read again, "While he thus spake, there came a cloud and overshadowed them,
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.160]   and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:54.280]   Now you see, the effect of a mere glimpse, as it were, of the glory of God has this effect
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.980]   upon the disciples.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:02.480]   They become drowsy and heavy and sleepy and filled with fear as this cloud comes, as it
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.760]   were, to help them to stand between them in the blazing sight.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.520]   There's one statement of it, but let me give you another.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.240]   You remember what happened to the Apostle Paul who was still Saul of Tarsus on the road
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   to Damascus.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.120]   He was a very self-confident man, a very able man, a man well-versed in the Scriptures,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.360]   a man who taught about God and thought he knew God.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:37.200]   One glimpse of the glorified Lord Jesus Christ strikes him helpless, blinds him, and there
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.880]   he is lying blinded and helpless on the road to Damascus.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   What is it?
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:50.200]   Oh, he's just had a glimpse of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ with a naked
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.920]   eye, and that's the effect.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.600]   Then let me give you one further illustration of it.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.360]   In the book of Revelation, John at the very beginning tells us about how the revelation
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.680]   of the vision came to him, and this is what he says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.440]   feet as one dead."
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.000]   He was given a vision of the glorified Lord in this symbolic manner, but the effect of
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.420]   that upon him was he fell as if he were dead, almost killed by it.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:31.000]   In other words, no man can see God and live, and yet we must see God, as it were, because
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.600]   we'll never know the truth apart from that, and we need to know the truth.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.880]   Well, the answer is the Incarnation.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.800]   Here is God, but in the flesh.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:52.720]   We can't add to Charles Wesley's perfect expression of it, "Veiled in flesh, the Godhead
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.380]   seen, hail, incarnate deity."
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.380]   There it is.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.020]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.660]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.920]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.820]   Very well, here it is, at one and the same time, you get a revealing and a veiling, and
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.500]   it's all for our benefit.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.380]   We couldn't stand the direct sight, it would kill us.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.720]   And yet we must have this sight, we must have this knowledge.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.540]   It is only the Only Begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father who can really declare
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:37.780]   him, and he has come, and he has done so in a way that we can bear, that we can stand.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:45.980]   There is this sense then in which we are seeing God and yet living, because he came veiled
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.380]   in the flesh.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.260]   His coming then makes the revelation possible to us.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:13:04.100]   And as we are told at the beginning of Matthew's Gospel, he is Emmanuel, God, with us.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:12.060]   The Word which is God was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:18.540]   Here is then, I say, the first matter that we have to grasp and to realize.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.060]   The truth had to come in this way.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.340]   The truth about God cannot finally be stated adequately in propositions.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:33.060]   There was those revelations of it, parts and portions, bits and pieces, as we've seen,
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.620]   given in the old time, that, oh, it wasn't enough, it wasn't adequate, it was just something
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.180]   to encourage the people and to lead them on.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.900]   Then he comes.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.420]   He has to come.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.900]   It's the only way.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.700]   And yet he had to come in this particular way.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.740]   Otherwise the coming would but have blinded us again.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.220]   So you see, we are driven to the Incarnation.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.820]   The Lord demands the Incarnation.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:09.380]   Otherwise we can never have any knowledge of this truth which is God.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.340]   But let's look at it also in terms of grace.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:23.420]   Let this be our second matter, why grace had to come also in that particular way and manner.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:30.140]   Now, here, of course, the way to expound this is to look at that statement of the Apostle
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:36.820]   in Galatians 4.4, "When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son made
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.260]   of a woman, made under the law."
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.980]   There it is, that's the exposition of this.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:54.820]   Now, God sent his Son in that particular way, made of a woman and made under the law.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820]   Why?
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.500]   That's the question.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.660]   Why did he come in that particular way?
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.380]   Why are those two things absolutely essential?
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.380]   The answer is still that the law demanded them, the law insists upon them.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.780]   That is, if we are to be saved from the law.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:16.220]   He must be made of a woman, he must be made under the law, as the verse goes on to tell
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.340]   us, "to redeem them that were under the law."
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.660]   How did it, what does it mean?
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.020]   Well, let's work it out.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.700]   Why were the two aspects necessary?
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.780]   And the answer can be put like this.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:39.740]   First, our representative must be human, must be a man.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.740]   Why?
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.020]   Well, because we are human.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:51.580]   Now, we don't always realize this as we should, we don't appreciate its meaning as we should.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.500]   Here is the problem.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:03.100]   It is man who has fallen, it is man who has become sinful, it is man who is in disgrace.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:10.100]   It is mankind itself that fell in man.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:16.820]   And so the law rightly demands the punishment of man.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:26.620]   And not only does the law demand the punishment of man, the devil likewise, in a sense, insists
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.780]   that our representative should be man in this way.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.180]   That it was God who had made everything, and the supreme point of God's creative work was
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.780]   the creation of man.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.380]   Man was made in the image of God.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.620]   He was the echo of God's creative work.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:51.580]   And God looked upon it all and saw that it was good, which may be translated as God looking
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.180]   upon it all and being proud of it and pleased with it.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:01.660]   But the devil comes in and he tempts men and men fall.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.760]   And apparently what God has done, and God's supreme achievement, has turned into a failure.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.220]   And the devil immediately begins to taunt God with this, "This man that thou hast made,
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:19.540]   look at him, made in thine own image, the crowning act of thy great purpose in creation,
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.420]   there he is, behold him."
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:29.540]   So the devil taunts God with this and with his failure, and particularly his failure
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.420]   in man.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:40.440]   And therefore I say, for God to be justified and God to be vindicated, it is absolutely
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:49.080]   essential that whoever comes to redeem man and mankind and to restore mankind must be
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.080]   a man.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.560]   A mere declaration of forgiveness on the part of God would not solve the problem.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.640]   It not only wouldn't solve it from the standpoint of the law, it wouldn't satisfy it from the
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.600]   standpoint of the devil.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.720]   Where God, merely to look upon men in his fallen state and say, "Nevertheless I forgive
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.400]   you in spite of what you've done and what you are," the devil would still have triumphed.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.800]   The devil would still say, "All right, that's all right, you've forgiven him, but look at
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   him.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   He's still a wreck.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   He's still hopeless.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:27.000]   He is still far removed from what he was at the beginning."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.440]   So that a mere declaration of forgiveness would never be enough.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.940]   That is where these people who would explain the death of Christ upon the cross in terms
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:42.400]   of moral influence alone, have never understood the very first beginnings of the gospel.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.780]   They've never even understood the incarnation, leave alone the atonement.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.780]   That wouldn't solve the problem.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.820]   It's not enough.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.080]   In the same way where God could send some angelic representative into this world, that
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   wouldn't be adequate either.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.240]   Because man has failed, man must succeed.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   God is not vindicated.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.400]   God can't answer and silence the devil and his tauntings and his jeerings until he has
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.760]   produced a man that is perfect and that doesn't fail.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.400]   So I say that our representative, our Redeemer, must be a man.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.000]   He must be made of a woman.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.720]   And he must truly be made a woman.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.880]   And he must truly become a man.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.400]   A God appearing in a case of flesh, as some of those early heretics thought, those Gnostic
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.720]   heretics, the Scythists they're called, who said that our Lord's body was a mere
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   appearance.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.160]   Again, they missed the whole point.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   It would never have satisfied the devil.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   The devil would have said, "Yes, you had to send your son and put a shell of flesh
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.720]   upon him because you knew that no man could ever stand up to me and to my temptations.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   You put up man as your supreme achievement.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.560]   Very well.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.360]   Show me that a man can really stand and triumph and prevail."
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:13.920]   So it is essential that he should be made of a woman, that he should truly have a real
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:20.120]   human nature, as you and I have a human nature, that he's not a God in an appearance of
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   flesh.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.720]   He is truly man, made flesh, made of a woman.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.960]   And the reason is, I say, that if he is to do a work for us, to satisfy God on our behalf,
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   he's got to be one of us.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.640]   Well, no, then that was why we read those portions out of the second chapter of the
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.480]   epistle to the Hebrews at the beginning.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.960]   Let me remind you of them again.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.360]   They are so crucially important.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:53.280]   "For it became him"â€”this is the tenth verse, and that is Godâ€”"it became him,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.200]   for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.960]   to make of the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering."
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   Many sons.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.520]   He is the leader of these many sons.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.760]   Then take verse 11.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.440]   "For both he that sanctifieth"â€”that's the Lord Jesus Christâ€”"and they who are
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:25.360]   sanctified"â€”that is, us who believeâ€”"are all of one, one nature, all human beings,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.160]   for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren."
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.480]   Then follow the quotations which establish that fully.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.440]   But listen to verse 14, which puts it still more explicitly.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:43.320]   "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood"â€”that's to say, those
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.280]   of us who are Christians, we are the children, and we are partakers of flesh and bloodâ€”"he
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.040]   also himself likewise took part of the same.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.760]   That through death he might destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil,
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.160]   and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.320]   And again he puts it negatively in verse 16.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.080]   "For verily he took not on him the nature of angels," which, if you like, you can
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.160]   translate like this, "he stretched not out his hand to help angels, but he took on him."
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.240]   The seed of Abraham.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.800]   Still the same point is being emphasized.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:25.600]   "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:33.040]   might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   for the sins of the people.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.600]   For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   tempted."
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:47.760]   Now that's the most important and absolutely essential and vital doctrine.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:56.360]   We need someone to represent us, to save us, and he must be a man for these reasons, because
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.800]   we are flesh and blood and have partaken of them, he himself also must be like us, he
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.200]   must be one of us, he must be identified with us.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   And so it is essential that he should be made of a woman, that the word truly should be
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   made flesh.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.400]   Very well, but let's go on.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   He had to be made of a woman, I say, and become flesh because we are human.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:35.600]   But secondly, this had to happen because God's law must be honored and must be kept.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.480]   So it's not enough to say that he was made of a woman, we've got to add that he was made
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.840]   under the law.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.240]   That's the exposition of this John 1, 17.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   Why?
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.440]   Well, for the reason that I'm giving in this way, that as our representative he must satisfy
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.720]   all the demands that are being made upon us.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:07.760]   So he is made under the law, though he is God the Son, he is made under the law.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:15.040]   And that means that as a man he was subject to the demands of the law.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.000]   They were all observed in connection with him.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.200]   You remember when he was born, the offering of the turtle doves, the circumcision, and
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.760]   all these things, and he was brought up as a Jew, attended the synagogue, and was made
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.320]   familiar with the demands of the law.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.160]   The law makes these demands on us, so they must make their demands on him, otherwise
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.320]   he is not our representative.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.840]   So he is made under the law.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.920]   But it is essential that he should observe this law and that he should keep this law,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.680]   and that he should do so perfectly.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:55.160]   He can't deliver us from the curse of the law until he has rendered a perfect obedience
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.180]   to the law, and in his life he did so.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.600]   He was made under the law in order that he might do so.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.640]   He wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for us.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:11.720]   As our representative, as the second Adam, as the last man, he has rendered a perfect
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.800]   obedience to the law of God.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.720]   Well, that's the first part of our problem, but it still leaves the other, which is that
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.880]   we are all guilty.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.000]   We are all under the condemnation of the law.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.560]   And here it is thundering against us and making its demand that the soul that sinneth it shall
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.160]   die.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.880]   And if that happens to us, it is the end of us, and we are eternally estranged and alienated
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.800]   from the presence of God.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.000]   But he comes as our representative, he is made of a woman, he is made under the law.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Why?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.880]   Well, because he's got to bear this penalty of the law.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:58.100]   So you see again in that one chapter in Hebrews 2, we are given the perfect explanation.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:04.400]   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that's to say he was made
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.160]   flesh, lower than the angels, he didn't come as an angel, he had come as an angel in the
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.920]   Old Testament many times, but now he comes a little lower than the angels, he comes as
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   a man.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.240]   What for?
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   For the suffering of death.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.840]   We see him now crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   for every man.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.640]   He was made of a woman, made under the law, in order that the guilt of our sins might
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.760]   be placed upon him as a man, and that they might be punished in him, in other words,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.840]   that he might die.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:48.480]   So he had to be made of a woman, he had to be made under the law, otherwise he couldn't
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.040]   bear our guilt and the punishment of the law upon it, and he couldn't die.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.700]   God cannot die.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.440]   So he had to be made of a woman, he had to be made flesh, and he had to be made under
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.000]   the law.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.040]   Very well then, here is this astounding thing.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.480]   The law demands this, the law demands the incarnation.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.680]   He's got to be a man, otherwise he's not subject to the law, he can't honor it positively and
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.400]   negatively and answer all its demands, and if he doesn't do that, he doesn't save us.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.560]   So the incarnation is absolutely essential for that reason.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.800]   He must be a man, otherwise he doesn't represent us.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:34.760]   Neither the law nor the devil would ever have been satisfied.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.520]   So he had to become a man and live as he did, and die as he did, and be buried in a grave
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.320]   as he was.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.120]   But of course I can't stop there.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.120]   Our representative, I say, has to be a man.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.600]   I know history to end, our representative has to be God, he has to be divine.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:10.840]   Why well for this reason, that if he had not been God as well as man, he would not have
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:18.440]   saved us, even though he had died upon the cross and was buried in a grave.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:27.160]   If he had been man only, our burden would have killed him and destroyed him, in the
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.600]   sense of his eternal separation from God.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.720]   Death would have been too much for him.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.360]   The guilt and the weight of our sins and all attached to them would have crushed him.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   But because he is God as well as man, and this is the meaning of the incarnation, God
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.200]   and man, Word made flesh, doesn't cease to be Word, but is made flesh in addition, takes
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.480]   unto him, as Hebrews puts it, our human nature, doesn't cease to be God, but adds unto that
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.800]   our human nature, truly God, truly man.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.160]   The only begotten God who is still in the bosom of the Father is here on earth, dwells
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.440]   among us, is amongst us.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.320]   He is at once God and man.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   Now the importance and the significance of death, you see, is this, that because he is
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:28.800]   God as well as man, he is able even to deal with the problem of death.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:36.080]   Listen to how he puts it himself in this self-same gospel of John in chapter 10, in verses 17
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   and 18.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.840]   "Therefore," he says, "doth my Father love me?
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.600]   Because I lay down my life, that I may take it again."
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.640]   No man can ever use language like that.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.080]   "I lay down my life that I may take it again."
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.200]   No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.960]   Where are these ridiculous people who say that what happens on the cross is that men
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.560]   are taking his life from him?
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.280]   See, they haven't begun to understand it.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.640]   That's the whole error of pacifism, that it completely misunderstands what happened
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.560]   on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.840]   No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.120]   I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.040]   This commandment have I received of my Father.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.600]   Now, no one else could use such language.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.560]   No one else can speak like that.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.120]   No one else can look into the face of death and say, "I'll deal with you.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.760]   I'll go through you and emerge the other side."
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   He's God as well as men.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.400]   He is Lord even of death, though he is here in flesh.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.240]   Now, this is the most important point.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:44.080]   The New Testament goes on emphasizing it, therefore.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   Listen to the statement that is made by the Apostle Peter in his sermon on the day of
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.200]   Pentecost at Jerusalem, where he expounds this.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.680]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God," Acts 2,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.400]   23, "ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain, whom God hath raised
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.960]   up, having loosed the pains of death."
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.440]   Because it was not possible that he should be held in it.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.800]   Many men, of course, they've all died.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.080]   He goes on to say about the Patriarch David, "He was with us, but he's dead."
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.320]   But this man, though he's of the seed of David, it was not possible that he should
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.440]   be holden of death.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.080]   Then there's another statement where the 16th Psalm is quoted, "Because thou wilt
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:37.280]   not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   That's why.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.600]   Because he is the Holy One, because he is God as well as men.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.040]   And he had to be God as well as men in order that he could bear this guilt, and the law
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.720]   might do its work, and the law might be honored.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:56.360]   Yes, but he needs some power in addition to go through even death itself and emerge triumphant.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.000]   He does in this way.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.200]   So that later on he is referred to as the Prince of Life.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.520]   Peter describes him to the crowd outside the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   He says, "You've crucified the Prince of Life, the Author of Life.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.320]   Here is one that is the maker and the author of life, and is therefore stronger even than
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.240]   death itself."
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.960]   And so it's not surprising that the Apostle Paul, when he comes to write to the Romans,
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   says, "Who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, but declared to be
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.720]   the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.560]   the dead."
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.520]   This establishes that he is God, otherwise he'd never have risen.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.160]   Sin would have finished even him, though he were perfect man, as Adam was perfect man.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.720]   And so again the Apostle, in writing to the Corinthians, says, "Death is swallowed up
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:58.320]   in victory," of course, "because he is the master and the conqueror even of death."
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.120]   And so the epistle to the Hebrews, in its way, puts it like this, in chapter 7, verses
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.480]   15 and 16.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.840]   And it is yet far more evident, "For that after the similitude of Melchizedek there
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   ariseth another priest who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.320]   the power of an endless life."
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.120]   Yes, he's secret.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.440]   This is the explanation of the work that he does that none other can do.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:35.680]   So he goes on, "For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.400]   from sinners, and made higher than the heavens."
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.280]   And there's only one who can answer to all this.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.040]   It is the one who is God as well as man.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.320]   "For the law maketh men high priests, which have infirmity; but the word of the earth,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.600]   which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated, forevermore.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.880]   Therefore he ever liveth, etc."
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   But listen to him himself speaking to John again in the vision of the book of Revelation.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:14.160]   "I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold, I am alive forevermore.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   Amen.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   And have the keys of death, keys of hell and of death."
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.760]   He is the master.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.640]   He is the conqueror.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.400]   He is the one who can bear the full weight of the demands of the law and die, but rise
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.520]   again, conquering even the last enemy.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:44.400]   He was made sin for us, and yet he rises triumphant, or death and or the grave.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.960]   Very well, you see, we are establishing this thesis.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.600]   That the law demands that grace should come, and that it should come in the way in which
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.680]   it did come.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.400]   That the eternal God should become a man, that the word should be made flesh, that to
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:12.680]   our deliverer is a theanthropos, God-man, God and man, two natures but one person.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:19.460]   And as a final thought I suggest something like this to you.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.120]   That in order that you and I might receive the fruits of salvation purchased by him in
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:34.280]   that way, our Saviour must be a God-man, God and man.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.080]   Oh, well, like this.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.740]   Look at these aspects of this great matter.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:48.680]   We have seen that the law has postulated that we receive new life.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:55.240]   We need a new nature, we need a new heart, a new outlook, new everything.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.600]   And it is in and through him that we receive it.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.960]   He is the beginner and the originator of a new humanity.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:10.560]   He is the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.680]   You and I, to be saved, we need to be partakers of the divine nature.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.640]   How can that happen?
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.320]   How can we ever receive a divine nature?
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.840]   How can we become partakers of a divine nature?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.480]   We can't, as we are.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.000]   The divine can't mix with that which is sinful.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.940]   But what we receive is his nature, the nature of the God-man.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.840]   We receive it from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.440]   We are born of him, we come out of him.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.580]   He is the beginner of a new humanity, a new human nature.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.360]   As one started in Adam, another starts in him.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.200]   That's the new life we receive.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.080]   That's the new nature that we receive.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.160]   And that is why he is not ashamed to call us brethren.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.120]   Salvation does not mean that our old human nature is improved.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.280]   It means that we receive a new nature.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.440]   We are born again.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:13.520]   We become partakers of a new humanity, of a new human nature.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.800]   But it goes beyond that.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:25.840]   The New Testament tells us that we are in him, and that we are joined to him, that the
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.760]   church is the body of Christ, and that we are members in particular.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.720]   How can this possibly be?
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.360]   Well, there is only one answer.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.600]   It is because he is God and man.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.880]   If he hadn't become man, we could never be joined to him.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.520]   But as the God-man, the mediator, we can be joined to him.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.600]   He is the head, we are the members, and we receive our humanity and our strength and
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.440]   our everything in and through him.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.680]   And so we see that wonderful picture that Paul puts in the epistle to the Ephesians
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.040]   in chapter 4, in verse 16.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:07.840]   "Where, having said that Christ is the head of the body, goes on, from whom the whole
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.960]   body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:19.520]   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.640]   the edifying of itself in love."
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.920]   This is salvation.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.160]   This is how the devil is answered.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.480]   We are in him, the living head, and we receive the power, the strength, the nutriment, the
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.600]   sustenance, everything comes to us from him.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:40.280]   It flows from him, the living head, through us all.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:47.680]   Or if you prefer it in another way, "Having led captivity captive, and having ascended
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.640]   on high, he gave gifts to men.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:58.600]   Having completed the work, he was able to send down the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.240]   And the marvelous and the wonderful thing is this, that the Spirit that was given to
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.400]   him without measure is exactly the same Spirit that is given to us.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.880]   Given to him without measure, given to us in measure, but the same Spirit.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:19.240]   The Spirit that was in him is in us, as he is, so are we in the world.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.160]   Now this would never have happened if he hadn't become man as well as God.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.560]   This is the ultimate result of the incarnation and his death and all that followed from it.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.960]   And lastly, I hold before you this most comforting thought about him as our great sympathetic
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.000]   high priest.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.800]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews keeps on repeating it.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.960]   "Wherefore, in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.880]   might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:59.400]   for the sins of the people; for in that he hath suffered, he himself hath suffered being
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   tempted.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.200]   He is able to succour them that are tempted."
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   Listen again.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:11.040]   "We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.760]   but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.200]   If he hadn't become man, he could never have been tempted.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.960]   "God neither tempteth any men nor can be tempted," says James in his first chapter.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.320]   But here is one tempted in all points like as we are.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   Why?
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.520]   Well, he became man, he became flesh, he became incarnate, God and man, subject to temptation
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.880]   under the law, made of a woman.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.880]   Very well.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.160]   And so this man goes on repeating it and blurring in it.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.360]   And then he puts it like this in chapter 5.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.400]   "For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.760]   God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.600]   He must be one who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.480]   way, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:10.960]   And by reason hereof he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins."
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:18.040]   And his argument is that the Lord Jesus Christ has done all this for us.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.160]   He knows our frame because he's been in it.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   He knows the heat of temptation, the difficulty of battling against the world and the flesh
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:34.560]   and the devil, because he's been here himself and he's been subject to it all, tempted in
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.780]   all points like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.840]   He knows our ignorance, he knows our frailty, he's mixed with men and women.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.200]   He himself limited his own eternal knowledge while he lived here as men.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.960]   He knows, he understands.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:57.640]   And so when we go to the throne of grace we can go with boldness and with confidence to
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.960]   obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.600]   In every pang that rends the heart the man of sorrows bears a part.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.720]   He's been here, he knows.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.360]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.520]   You see, from every standpoint the law demands the incarnation.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   He must be God, he must be man, he must be made of a woman, he must be made under the
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:29.480]   law and yet he must be God.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.960]   And he is birth.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:46.520]   For the law was given by Moses, but thank God grace and truth came through or by or
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:43:03.800]   Jesus, man, Christ, the anointed of God, the eternal, the everlasting Saviour.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:10.360]   That as I conceive it and understand it is the way in which we are to think of Christmas
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.440]   and its meaning.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.320]   Isn't it tragic that it becomes sentimentalized?
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.200]   My dear friends, this is a time for thinking even before singing.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:27.440]   There's no value in your singing unless it's thoughtful.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.520]   That's why we will have a service here tonight and not a carol service so-called.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.880]   These matters are to be understood.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:42.200]   You can't sing unless you understand and if our singing isn't the result of our understanding
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.960]   it is almost a mockery and perhaps something even worse.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:59.680]   The law was given by Moses, grace and truth came.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.800]   They had to come.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:08.200]   It's the only way in which we can ever know grace and its blessings and ever come to know
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:16.680]   God and to rejoice in him and to glorify him forever.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:24.440]   I say again, thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.240]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:37.320]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
