[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.840]   My guest today is Dr. Michael Eisenberg.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.080]   Dr. Michael Eisenberg is a medical doctor
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.760]   specializing in urology
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.400]   and an expert in male sexual function and fertility.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.860]   He is both a clinician who sees patients,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.880]   as well as a research scientist,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.900]   having published over 300 peer-reviewed articles
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.040]   on male sexual function, urology, and fertility.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.840]   And he is considered one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.460]   in male sexual health.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.300]   Today, we discuss a broad range of topics
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760]   important to all men,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   including erectile dysfunction and function.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.620]   We also discuss prostate health and urinary health.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100]   We discuss fertility and sperm count.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.360]   We discuss even topics seemingly esoteric,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.240]   such as why penile lengths are actually increasing over time
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640]   while sperm count seem to be decreasing.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.440]   Today, you'll also learn some very interesting surprises,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.460]   such as the fact that a very, very small percentage
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.800]   of erectile dysfunction
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.480]   actually stems from hormone dysfunction.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.360]   Rather, the vast majority of erectile dysfunction
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.800]   stems from issues that are either vascular,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.040]   that is related to blood flow, or neural.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.600]   And today, you'll learn about a large variety of treatments
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.080]   for erectile dysfunction.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   Dr. Eisenberg also dispels a lot of common myths
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.640]   that you hear out there,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   both on the internet and in popular culture,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.280]   that relate to male sexual health and function.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.000]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.040]   I assure you that you will have a thorough understanding
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.000]   of what male sexual health is,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440]   how it relates to other aspects of health,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.480]   and how to think about treating, maintaining,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.440]   and improving all aspects of male sexual health,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.200]   fertility, and function.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.020]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.680]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.740]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.400]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.440]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.600]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.240]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.160]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.940]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.920]   of the visual system,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.960]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.880]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.600]   Roca understands this and has designed eyeglasses,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.460]   both for sport and for wearing in casual settings
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.820]   or to work or to dinner,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.420]   that always allow you to see with crystal clarity.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.500]   Their eyeglasses are extremely lightweight
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.340]   and they won't slip off your face, even if you get sweaty.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.200]   I wear Roca sunglasses when I'm driving
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   into direct sunlight or when it's particularly bright
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   during the middle of the day.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.660]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.260]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.520]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.140]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.560]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.220]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.980]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.880]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.000]   really is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.580]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.740]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.100]   is to make sure that the temperature
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.840]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.440]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.080]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.800]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.920]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.860]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.560]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.240]   With Eight Sleep, you can program the temperature
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.840]   and end of your night.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.640]   It has a number of other features like tracking
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.620]   the amount of rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380]   that you get, things that are essential
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.040]   to really dialing in the perfect night's sleep for you.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.640]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.320]   for well over two years now, and it has greatly
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.200]   improved my sleep.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.000]   I fall asleep far more quickly.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.200]   I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.040]   and I wake up feeling far more refreshed than I ever did
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.640]   prior to using an Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.900]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.560]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.240]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.320]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.200]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.840]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Michael Eisenberg.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540]   Dr. Eisenberg, welcome.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.860]   - Thank you, good to be here.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.140]   - I've been looking forward to talking to you
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.840]   for a long time because these days we hear a lot
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.540]   about the diminishing quality of sperm,
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.840]   which in some ways seems to be attached to the conversation
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   about diminishing quality of environment, people,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.120]   intelligence, you know, there's a lot woven
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   into this statement that sperm quality is declining.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.920]   And some of it, I think people assume
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.440]   is related to environmental changes.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.320]   Some of it, I think people assume it are related
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.200]   to changes in behaviors.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.060]   So maybe less exercise, less sunlight, who knows?
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.880]   Hopefully you'll tell us what's really going on.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.020]   But the first question I have is,
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.120]   is sperm quality actually declining?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.280]   And regardless, what is sperm quality?
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.320]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.720]   So I think it's very controversial,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.440]   I think is your question alludes to.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.880]   So I think we'll start by just talking
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   about what sperm quality is and why it's important.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.660]   So for reproduction, as you've covered on the podcast before
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.720]   a man makes semen and that has sperm in it.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   And so when we're talking clinically about a semen analysis,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.560]   there's a few things we look at.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.820]   We look at the amount of ejaculate semen that comes out.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.520]   We look at the sperm, how many there are.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.240]   We look at their motility or movement.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.200]   We look at their morphology or shape.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.520]   There's some more advanced testing
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.640]   that's done in rare cases,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.960]   looking at fragmentation of DNA, for example,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   or there's some newer tests
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.480]   looking at epigenetic profiles of sperm.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.000]   But essentially these are all markers of fertility.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   So fertility in itself is a team sport, right?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.480]   So it's hard to label a man as fertile or not fertile
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.200]   without knowing about his partner.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.460]   But nevertheless, based on these different parameters,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.900]   we try and quantify how likely a man is
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.660]   to be able to achieve a pregnancy.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.380]   So the World Health Organization every decade or so
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.060]   looks over the existing literature
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.600]   and defines these different cut points
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.940]   of what's normal or what's sub-fertile for those levels.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.080]   So that's sort of the backdrop of what semen is
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   and how these tests are done
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.220]   or what these tests represent.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.280]   Now, the question of whether they've declined over time
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   has been a question for a number of years.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.980]   There was a landmark paper in the early '90s
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.580]   by Carlson and a group in Denmark
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.360]   that showed this temporal decline
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.900]   over the last 50 years from that time point.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.640]   And so what the investigators had done
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.400]   is looked over the literature
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.240]   for studies that reported semen quality around the world
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.600]   and noted that the quality in the earliest studies,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.360]   like in kind of the mid 20th century, were here,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.300]   and then over time they had sort of declined
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.600]   the more recent studies.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.520]   Now, that study was very controversial.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.220]   There was questions about waiting from different studies,
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.920]   because as you can imagine,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.260]   there's not a lot of early studies,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.060]   so putting a lot more importance on those
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.980]   rather than some of the later ones.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.720]   And so since then, there's been many other studies
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.320]   that have come out in time.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.340]   And even today, it remains very controversial.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.760]   I think if I were to say that I believe there's a decline,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.940]   some of my colleagues and friends
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.320]   would be very upset with me.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.980]   If I say I don't believe it, some of my colleagues
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.180]   and friends would be very upset with me.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.980]   So I would say that my opinion really varies
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.340]   based on whose paper I've read,
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.220]   and there's some very convincing studies on each side of it.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.220]   Most recently, just in the last year or so,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.160]   there was a meta-analysis of tens of thousands of men
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.740]   where they looked at, again, a host of these studies
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.640]   over the last number of decades all around the globe.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.940]   So prior studies really just focused
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.960]   on the Western Hemisphere, Western countries,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.340]   'cause there was more data from that.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.460]   But more recently, we've gotten a lot of data
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.660]   from Africa, from Asian countries as well.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.740]   And those also support this decline.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.860]   So one of the counterarguments to why we're seeing that
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.460]   is just sort of an evolution of techniques over time.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.380]   So that's one of the popular questions
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.680]   about whether there's really a true decline.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.740]   I think as you're alluding to why there would be a decline
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.740]   is also unknown, but you've sort of labeled perfectly
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.440]   the kind of most common hypotheses,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   so whether it's an environmental exposure.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.980]   A lot of things have changed over the last 50 years,
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.480]   and I think chemical exposure is certainly one of those.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.320]   And there have been some fairly convincing
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.640]   preclinical studies, so mostly done in animals
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.660]   that show that exposure to different chemicals,
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.660]   phthalates, BPA, other things, may actually harm
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   reproductive function for men and for women as well.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.460]   And so it may be that these chemicals
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.060]   that we're being exposed to as kids and adults,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.100]   or even probably more sinisterly
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.500]   when we're kind of developing in utero,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   that may be kind of the most harmful exposure.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.420]   But there's also been an obesity epidemic as well,
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.840]   and there's a strong link between
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.820]   a man's reproductive function and body weight.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.020]   And so that's also thought to play a role
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.180]   in some of this too.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.460]   So I think there are convincing studies,
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.260]   but the other, I guess, aspect to this
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.420]   is that there's variations in semen quality
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.300]   around the country and around the world.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.820]   There's geographic variation.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.820]   And so that's also sort of an unknown explanation.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.380]   There could be different genetic compositions of men,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.860]   and so there's different reproductive potential
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.700]   in that source.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.240]   There could be different environmental exposures,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.420]   diet, exercise, lifestyle.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.200]   And there's a famous study done a number of years ago
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.300]   where they looked at semen quality among fathers.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   So these are men that had achieved a pregnancy,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.800]   and at the first prenatal visit,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.940]   they had the fathers give a semen sample.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.900]   And so this has done four centers around the country.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.900]   I think one in California, there was one in the Midwest,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.220]   there was one in New York.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.740]   So they basically found that semen quality
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.640]   was highest in the urban centers,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.920]   and New York tended to be the highest numbers
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.120]   where it was lower in the Midwest.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.260]   And so the hypothesis was potentially
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.640]   because it was a more rural setting,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.040]   maybe there was pesticide exposure
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   and that had led to these lower numbers.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.240]   But another equally plausible explanation
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.620]   may be that sort of a different population,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.380]   and maybe that could explain these differences.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.240]   So I think it's very important.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.220]   And I think one of the sort of lacking things in this
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.740]   is there's not really longitudinal data.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.500]   One of the greatest things would be
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.800]   if we just started tracking semen quality around the country
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.440]   just like we do obesity, like, you know,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.320]   NHANES, CDC's survey of health in the US,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.340]   if we added semen quality onto that.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.580]   That way you could really see, you know,
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.680]   how it varies around the country and, you know,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.460]   sort of compare like to like to see over time
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.780]   if there's really this progression.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.280]   You know, one of the only studies to do that in Denmark,
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.980]   they've started around, you know, around 2000
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.680]   and tracked semen quality among, you know,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.640]   volunteers that came in when they were conscripted
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   for military service in Denmark,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.480]   they were offered the opportunity
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.100]   to participate in this study.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.660]   And so some men did.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.100]   And what they found is actually that semen quality
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.240]   was fairly uniform over about 20 years where they had data.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.600]   But sort of another very interesting part of that study
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.520]   is that only about a quarter of those men
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.880]   had normal semen quality.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.460]   So it was sort of very concerning.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.840]   You know, it was, I guess, reassuring
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.640]   that it wasn't further declining,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.000]   but very concerning that only a quarter of Danish men
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.620]   had, you know, normal semen quality.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.020]   And they're one of the, I think,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.660]   thought leaders in this field,
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   just because it's sort of a reproductive crisis there.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.700]   - You mentioned that some of this apparent decline
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.740]   in semen quality might be related to the fact
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.520]   that the tools to measure semen quality
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.340]   are getting better and better.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.200]   And that would make sense if, for instance,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.300]   one is just looking at total volume, morphology,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.700]   which means shape, I should have clarified that,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.500]   how many forwardly motile sperm there are,
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.660]   and then also adding in, you know, a very sensitive measure,
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.520]   such as DNA fragmentation.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.400]   You know, essentially as the instruments get finer and finer,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.140]   you discover more and more details.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.020]   And if you are rating quality
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.000]   along a number of different dimensions,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.260]   then it would make sense that those would tear out
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.560]   into different levels.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.220]   So if one were to simply ask four couples
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.160]   who want to get pregnant,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.720]   and assuming that egg quality is not the issue,
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.280]   what percentage of failures to achieve successful pregnancy
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.640]   are the consequence of deficient sperm,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.480]   deficient in any way?
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.400]   And is that number increasing over time?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.220]   - Yeah, so I think that's really key.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.240]   I think when couples think about fertility,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.840]   usually it's thought of as a female problem.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   And I think there's just historic reasons for that.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.200]   You know, if you look at data in the US,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.720]   when couples do seek care for fertility,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.200]   the man has bypassed probably a third of the time,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.920]   even though when you look at the reasons for infertility,
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.400]   man contributes probably half of the time to infertility.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.640]   So I think there's a-- - Half.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.800]   - Half, yeah.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.140]   So I think there's a huge need
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.160]   just to understand and evaluate the man.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.900]   And one of the reasons for this, I think,
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.240]   is that one of the main treatments for infertility
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.320]   in the US is IVF, which is very powerful.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.520]   I think one of the greatest marvels of medicine
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.360]   in probably the last quarter century
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.680]   is our ability to mix a sperm and egg in a dish
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.580]   and create a life.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.040]   It's really remarkable.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.680]   But because it now takes just a single sperm
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.520]   through something called
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.000]   intracytoplasmic sperm injection,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.440]   where you can inject one egg or one sperm into an egg,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.680]   the bar has gone down dramatically.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.800]   For couples just trying without any assistance,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   probably need 20 to 40 million moving sperm.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.360]   But now with these remarkable techniques,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.560]   you just need one sperm.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.920]   And so because of that,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.960]   I think a lot of our innovation and research
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.040]   on male fertility has probably gone to the wayside
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.880]   just because clinically,
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.220]   we just need a few dozen sperm for most couples.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.560]   - What about testosterone levels?
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.100]   Are those also declining?
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.140]   We hear this.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.360]   And when I look at the literature,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.540]   I can find evidence for that.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.700]   But the question is also whether or not
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.960]   the amount of decline in testosterone levels
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   is significant in a way that impacts, let's say fertility,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.600]   but also vitality in other ways,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.800]   energy, mood, sexual health, et cetera.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.340]   What's the story with testosterone levels?
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.680]   Are they indeed declining on average
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   across the male population in the US and elsewhere?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.560]   - I think there is pretty convincing evidence
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.580]   that that is happening.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.800]   And I think the reason for that,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.160]   again, is probably not certain,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.360]   but there have been some pretty nicely designed
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.040]   cohort studies where they have recruited men
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.160]   in the 2000s, the 90s, the 80s.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.320]   And you can see that depending on when these men
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.460]   are recruited, just matching age for age,
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.720]   these testosterone levels tend to be lower.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.580]   And then NHANES, which is, again,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.100]   this sort of longitudinal study run by the CDC,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.760]   that has also shown,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.440]   looking at testosterone levels over decades,
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.240]   the testosterone levels have declined over time.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.320]   So chemical exposure is one possible explanation.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.080]   Again, either in adult or adolescent life or in utero,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.760]   but obesity I think is also sort of a convincing explanation
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.320]   is we're more sedentary, you know, we get bigger.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.360]   That's one of the places that testosterone can decline.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   I think there's different sort of explanations for that.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.320]   You know, as testosterone is produced,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.480]   it's aromatized in peripheral tissue,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.040]   you know, fatty tissue, fat has a lot of this aromatase,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.260]   so that converts testosterone to estrogen.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.400]   So it necessarily, you know, lowers the testosterone level
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   that's circulating in our body.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.880]   Also just insulating the testicles, our thighs get bigger.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.240]   Insulating the testes can also sometimes lower
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.040]   the efficiency of production a little bit too.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   - Because of heat effects?
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.120]   - Because of heat effects.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.800]   - Yeah, I was going to ask about this later,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.640]   but I'll ask about it now,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.880]   since we're talking about heat effects
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.020]   and sperm and testosterone,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.520]   the heat of course being not good
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.400]   for sperm health and testosterone,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.520]   which is, I've read a meta-analysis.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.380]   I don't know how high quality it is,
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.520]   but that explained that there is some evidence
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.840]   for either heat effects
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.660]   or possibly non-heat related effects of cell phone,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.520]   you know, smartphone in the pocket in pairing sperm health,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.780]   maybe even testosterone levels.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.560]   Now you hear this more often in kind of biohacky,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.240]   I don't know, circles,
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   which, you know, I'm not a fan of the word biohacking.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.680]   It's not clear what it means,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.180]   but it sounds like it means something
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.200]   about taking a shortcut using one thing
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.880]   for a purpose it wasn't intended.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.140]   But, you know, it also makes sense to me
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.140]   that a smartphone could generate some heat,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.720]   some radiation that might impair testicular function
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.160]   and therefore impair sperm quality
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.600]   and or testosterone levels.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.720]   But is there any real solid data
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.080]   that carrying your cell phone in your pocket,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.280]   let's assume on, that the cell phone is on,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.380]   is bad for sperm health or testosterone levels?
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.400]   - Yeah, so I think there's not convincing evidence
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.020]   that it's going to help testosterone levels.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.860]   I think that, you know--
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.240]   - It's going to hurt testosterone?
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   - It's not going to hurt, yeah.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.720]   So I should make clear that I think that
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.840]   in terms of production and heat effects,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.680]   you know, sperm production is much more sensitive
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.320]   than testosterone production.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.500]   But there have been some studies
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.700]   looking at cell phone exposure,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.960]   because, again, you're getting this,
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.840]   whether it's heat, whether it's sort of the,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.800]   you know, radio frequency, you know, waves coming in,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.400]   I think you could posit sort of different explanations
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.040]   of why that may be harmful.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   So there have been some studies that, you know,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.960]   looked early on, you know,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.160]   men that use cell phones more or less,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.100]   they had lower semen quality if they used it more.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.680]   But you can also imagine there's huge differences
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.480]   in men that do and do not use cell phones.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.020]   So, you know, it's a hard experiment to design,
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.740]   but there have been some studies doing this in vitro,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.420]   so in the laboratory, so taking, you know,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.880]   sperm in a cup, basically,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.400]   and putting a cell phone next to it or not next to it
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.780]   to try and see if that played a role.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.960]   There have been studies done
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.160]   where they sort of normalize the heat, you know,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.480]   they kind of put it on sort of a special stage
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.820]   so that it's not heat necessarily,
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.040]   but maybe it's RF exposure.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.160]   So those studies, I think, don't show
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.520]   sort of a clinically meaningful change,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.800]   but there have been some studies that say
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.340]   that maybe DNA fragmentation of sperm
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.460]   can go up a little bit if there's close proximity
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.540]   to a cell phone.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.780]   So I think, you know, when patients ask me that,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.240]   which is a common question I get in the clinic,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.840]   obviously patients are coming in,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.120]   they want to do, you know, whatever they can
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.860]   to try and improve their chances.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.820]   So I think generally, I think the data is not convincing,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.960]   but, you know, if it's easy enough,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.400]   certainly to be aware of it, you know,
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.240]   I think putting a laptop on a desk rather than in your lap,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.200]   I think for heat exposure is probably the biggest thing
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.320]   that we want to minimize.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.540]   About a year and a half ago, I did an episode
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.140]   about testosterone and estrogen,
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.940]   where it's manufactured in the male and female body,
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.220]   et cetera, and I found a very interesting graph
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.980]   in a textbook on behavioral endocrinology
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.700]   by a guy named Randy Nelson,
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.000]   who I happen to know through the field
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.560]   of behavioral endocrinology
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.500]   as it's typically studied in animals.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.820]   So most of that book centers on animal studies,
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.540]   but there's a fraction of the studies
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.040]   that center on human data.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.440]   And there was a very interesting graph
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.160]   that showed testosterone levels
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.260]   as a function of age in males.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.540]   And as one might expect,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.580]   testosterone levels were on average much higher
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.380]   in late teens, early 20s, 30s,
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.580]   and there was a progressive decline.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.840]   But what was remarkable to me about that graph
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.300]   is that even when exploring the scatter plots,
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.780]   'cause they showed individual points,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.900]   they didn't just show the averages
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.180]   of testosterone levels in men in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s,
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.180]   even 90s, there were these outliers,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.300]   these guys who had testosterone levels
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.460]   that were on par with testosterone levels
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.820]   of men in their 30s,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.220]   but these guys were in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, even 90s.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.760]   So do you observe this clinically?
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.600]   Do you observe that men are coming in,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.180]   who are older than 40 and have testosterone levels
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.580]   and presumably free testosterone levels as well
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.220]   that are still very high?
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.180]   The reason I asked is that I think we've all been told
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.860]   and we presume that testosterone levels decline with age,
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.460]   and one would expect some outliers.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.660]   And of course, we don't know whether or not those guys
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.260]   in their 90s who have the testosterone levels
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.060]   that match the averages of men in their 30s
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.580]   didn't have even greater testosterone levels in their 30s,
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.880]   but given that they were sealing out
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.540]   around 900 nanograms per deciliter,
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.160]   toward the high-end normal, depending on the scale,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.860]   already at age 90,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.300]   it's kind of hard to imagine that earlier
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.700]   they're walking around with 2,000 nanogram
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.520]   per deciliter testosterone.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.260]   So do you see this?
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.900]   Are there some, is there just a lot of natural variation
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.540]   in testosterone levels of men
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.460]   who walk into the clinic at any age?
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.860]   And of course, what is special about these individuals
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.540]   that are maintaining high normal testosterone levels
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.080]   into their later years?
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.920]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.660]   I think this is such a common question.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.180]   Anytime we talk about testosterone,
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.820]   I think anytime we talk about most sort of clinical tests
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.800]   that we do, what is average, what is normal?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.180]   So we do see great variation.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.760]   I mean, I think just like you're saying,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.980]   I usually let everybody know
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.940]   that usually testosterone peaks kind of early 20s,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.360]   and it tends to go down probably 1% a year forever.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.980]   But there are people that have very, very high levels.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.580]   Just mirroring that graph that you described,
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.300]   I certainly have patients,
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.500]   we screen for testosterone levels
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.900]   when patients come in with complaints
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.480]   where we're worried about that,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.420]   low energy level, low libido,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.860]   some of the symptoms of low testosterone, sexual dysfunction.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.080]   And to my surprise, sometimes these men,
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.140]   I've seen 80-year-olds
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.660]   that certainly have the highest testosterone level I'll see
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.600]   for six months.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.220]   Why that is, I think is not certain.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.900]   Maybe it has to do with everything.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.220]   There's probably sort of a bell-shaped curve,
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.140]   and everybody's a little bit different.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.420]   But androgen sensitivity, sensitivity of the receptor,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.840]   they make it more efficiently.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.340]   But I have not really noticed,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.580]   again, 'cause at least in clinical practice,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.740]   when patients come in, they come in with a complaint.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.760]   And so even men with very high levels,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.260]   they may have some of the same dysfunction
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.100]   in men with low levels.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.460]   So I think with low levels, you can try and treat that,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.140]   and that may be the solution.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.560]   But for men with these, what we would consider high levels,
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.300]   there may be other issues going on.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.740]   - Let me frame the question
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.900]   I was going to ask a little bit differently.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.560]   When someone comes into your clinic
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.580]   and you measure their testosterone levels,
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.200]   as you mentioned, they're likely coming in
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.140]   because they have some issue.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.640]   Prostate issue, sexual function issue, et cetera.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.020]   But you do get a read on their sort of crude morphology
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.520]   of their body, right?
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.540]   So you could visibly determine whether or not
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.400]   they're likely to be obese or not, regardless of age.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.880]   So earlier you mentioned obesity as a risk factor
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.040]   for lowering testosterone and sperm quality.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.520]   You mentioned that fat aromatizes testosterone
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.660]   into estrogen, so that's at least one mechanism.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.040]   I wish that could happen.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.200]   But if you were to just step back and say,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   okay, if somebody who walks into my clinic tends to be,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.500]   let's say, healthier looking, you know, not obese,
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.500]   let's just put the cutoff
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.580]   at what you would presume is obese,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.920]   is there a higher probability that their testosterone levels
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.000]   are going to be within normal range?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.500]   Conversely, when somebody walks in and they're obese,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.360]   do you fully expect their testosterone levels
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.500]   to be subnormal?
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.600]   Or are you sometimes seeing obese people walking in
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.800]   with high testosterone?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.320]   And the reason I'm asking this is not to create confusion,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.960]   is that I think that everybody out there
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.600]   who's thinking about sperm quality and testosterone levels
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   and this apparent decline, trying to figure out,
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.500]   you know, okay, what can we do in order to maintain
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.280]   the health metrics that are going to, of course,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.880]   increase fertility, but for those that don't want
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.280]   to have kids or who already have kids
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.000]   are going to at least maintain or improve vitality,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.140]   is obesity really the thing to avoid?
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.080]   So is there a, not one for one,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.640]   but is there a tight correlation
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.200]   between obesity and testosterone levels?
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.960]   - I would say that you cannot predict.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.700]   I think that sort of would be the take home.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.900]   And so I think that, you know,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.360]   more information is always better.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.320]   You know, when I see patients in clinic,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.800]   you know, some patients are walking around, you know,
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.760]   with, yeah, everything is totally normal
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.720]   and they're very healthy,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.500]   all the numbers come in at the normal range,
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.640]   but sometimes when men, you know, look totally normal,
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.220]   they talked about taking care of their life,
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.920]   they exercise, you know, five, seven days a week,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.480]   their testosterone levels can be very low.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.920]   So even despite, you know, having what we would consider
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.120]   should really give them, you know, symptoms,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.520]   they're able to compensate, you know,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.680]   maybe they've lived their whole life
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.440]   and that they don't know what normal is.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.600]   Now we get them, you know, to sort of normal levels,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.980]   a lot of times they feel better, again,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.560]   because they had no idea how they should feel.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.160]   But I think that that's just sort of important
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.020]   that everybody, you know, should be screened.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.160]   I think that, you know, testosterone, semen quality,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   there have been shown to even be barometers of health.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.100]   So, you know, men with lower testosterone levels
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.980]   have higher risk of, you know, heart disease,
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.140]   diabetes, mortality, the same studies exist
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.980]   for semen quality as well.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.640]   And, you know, again, they may have sort of
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.620]   a similar relationship and explanation why that may be,
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.100]   but I think it's hard to just predict, you know,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.920]   based on appearance, what, you know, testosterone will be,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.940]   what semen quality will be, what testicular function will be
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.140]   without actually getting some objective data.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.380]   And actually, if you look at the trend of semen quality
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.060]   decline over time, kind of getting back
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.460]   to some of those earlier points you were making,
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.020]   if you were to overlay that on the known association
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.400]   between obesity, its effects on semen quality,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.260]   that actually doesn't explain the whole decline.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.140]   'Cause the, you know, the purported decline
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.800]   in semen quality is about 50%.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.100]   But if you just, if you were to say, well,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.500]   what would we expect if, you know, we look at, you know,
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.380]   'cause we were able to track exactly how much fatter
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.740]   we are now than we used to be,
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.900]   that actually only explains about a 10% decline.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.420]   So I think there is, you know, to your point,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.740]   something more, and it is not something
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.380]   that you can just identify by eye.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:54.020]   - What are the do's and don'ts as it relates to,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.660]   I don't want to use the word optimizing.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.080]   It's gotten me into trouble before because the word optimize
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.440]   or optimal suggests that there's a perfect number
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.620]   that one should all attain if possible.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.360]   But in reality, optimal is a day-to-day thing, at least.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.260]   But what should people avoid in order to get
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.980]   their sperm quality as high as possible,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.020]   their testosterone level?
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.180]   Again, here, I have to be careful.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.440]   I don't want to say as high as possible
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.360]   because some people might not want excessive androgen,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.420]   but at the high end of normal,
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.360]   perhaps would be the ideal for many people.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.120]   What should people do?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.760]   What should they avoid?
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.940]   And here I'm setting aside any prescription
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.540]   clinical treatments that, such as testosterone injections
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.840]   or things like a chorionic gonadotrop,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.180]   human chorionic gonadotropin,
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.520]   things that we can talk about a little bit later,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.960]   but what should every male be doing
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.980]   in order to optimize these health parameters?
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.840]   - Yeah, so I think that there are some risk factors
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.620]   that we do, like we'll start with semen quality.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.120]   So we talked about heat, I think that's a big one.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.840]   So like hot tub saunas, trying to avoid those,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.820]   some light data on sea warmers.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.660]   Anytime we kind of get this external heat source
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.900]   to the scrotum, the testicles are outside the body
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.200]   'cause they need to be a little cooler.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.940]   So anything that warms them up can certainly be a problem.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.840]   - Could I just briefly interrupt there to ask,
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.020]   we've done episodes on sauna
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.620]   and some of the health benefits of sauna.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.540]   Is it sufficient for somebody to bring in a cold pack
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.600]   to the sauna and put that up in their groin?
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.780]   I actually have suggested that.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.220]   That's actually what I do when I go into the sauna.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.980]   And I have suggested this on podcasts,
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.480]   not just for people who are trying to conceive,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.780]   because it seems like heat, as you mentioned,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:40.500]   is bad for sperm, not quite as bad for testosterone levels,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.820]   but is it also true that heating the testicle too much
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.960]   is generally bad for endocrine function in males
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.940]   and therefore if one is going to go into a hot sauna
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.940]   for 20 minutes or more to essentially cool the scrotal area?
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I think the spermatogenesis
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.860]   or sperm production is certainly a lot more sensitive.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.140]   Whether you can sort of thwart the effects
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.740]   of external heat with a cooling pack,
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.700]   I think it makes sense.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.840]   There are studies that have looked at different ways
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.980]   to cool the scrotum and have compared
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.340]   semen quality before and after,
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.140]   and there's some data that may help.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.060]   It just depends how long you're gonna spend in the sauna
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.300]   and how cold that pack is gonna remain.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.900]   - So ice pack and in the sauna for 20 to 45 minutes.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.740]   - And is the ice pack still cold afterwards?
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.120]   - Yeah, they actually sell, and by the way,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.620]   I have no relationship to any of these companies,
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.900]   but they actually sell cold packs that are designed
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.260]   to be worn in your shorts.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.160]   So if you go to a, you know,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.060]   I'll go to a Russian banya every once in a while now,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.180]   I guess I'm outing myself.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.540]   Yes, I have a cold pack in my shorts
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.040]   when I go to the Russian banya.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.240]   But they have a sort of an insulation
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.960]   so that the very cold surface is cold enough,
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.620]   but it's not right up in contact with the scrotal skin
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.740]   because that could get, I wanna make a bad joke
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.920]   and say it could get sticky, that situation.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.460]   You don't want it being so cold
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.380]   that it actually would stick to the skin
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.300]   and then it could potentially damage the skin
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.500]   when you try and remove the cold pack.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.340]   So it has a thin insulating layer
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:12.320]   and yeah, that's essentially what it is.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.460]   - Yeah, I mean, frostbite to the scrotum is not theoretical.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.580]   It could certainly happen, so you do wanna be careful.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.200]   So I mean, in theory, that should be adequate
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.940]   to sort of, you know, to decrease the risk
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.220]   of that particular effect.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.500]   You know, I keep coming back to health,
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.740]   how important that is to maintain, you know,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.900]   adequate sperm production
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.860]   because I think these two are very linked.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.980]   You know, there have been studies that show
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   that men with more comorbid conditions,
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.340]   so obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.740]   as these sort of stack up,
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.940]   we see a decline in testicular function,
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.900]   so lower testosterone levels and lower sperm quality.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.440]   So I think, you know, taking ownership of your health,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.420]   I think is important as well.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.620]   You know, a lot of times,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.820]   fertility tends to be one of the first touch points
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.380]   that some men have with healthcare, you know,
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.420]   because generally what brings men to the doctor,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   it's usually pain or, you know, kind of a problem.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   So, you know, if men are in their 20s and 30s
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.780]   getting ready to start a family or 40s in some cases,
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.100]   sometimes they haven't seen a primary care doctor.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.020]   So some of these things,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.460]   some of this relationship has not been established yet.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.320]   So I think, you know, thinking about ways to start that,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.460]   I think would be important too.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   And then I know you don't wanna talk about testosterone,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.900]   but testosterone is actually a fairly common problem
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.820]   that we see in fertility clinics.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.780]   I would say that estimates say maybe about one in 20
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.740]   in fertile men are that way because of testosterone.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.180]   So I think when, you know,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.940]   people get testosterone in different places
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.760]   and hopefully, you know,
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.220]   whatever provider you're getting it from
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.220]   tells you that one of the side effects of this
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.340]   is lower sperm production.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.980]   It's actually been tested as a contraceptive
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.740]   and, you know, with some other agents,
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.060]   it can actually be fairly effective.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.380]   So we just wanna make sure that, you know,
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.120]   if men are starting testosterone,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.300]   they're doing it for the right reasons
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.220]   and they're doing it safely.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.120]   - I think about testosterone replacement therapy,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.220]   although as we were talking about
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.300]   before we started recording,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   I am really on a push now to rename what people call TRT,
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.120]   testosterone replacement therapy,
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.060]   because indeed some people have low testosterone
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.580]   and need it replaced, the R in TRT.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.900]   But I think what you're referring to, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.900]   is that there are probably millions of young men
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.980]   and older men taking exogenous testosterone
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.060]   injections, creams, pills, pellets, you know,
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.740]   any number of nasal sprays now, you know,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.820]   any number of different routes of delivery
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.740]   of exogenous testosterone.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.500]   And that dramatically reduces
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.300]   one's endogenous testosterone production
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.940]   and dramatically reduces one's sperm count
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.180]   and maybe even quality.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.700]   We'll maybe talk about this a little bit later,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.620]   but maybe even can, there's,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.300]   I've been told that it can perhaps introduce
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.340]   a DNA fragmentation within the remaining viable sperm
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.160]   as well.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.220]   So do I have that correct?
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.700]   You're saying that you see one in 20 men
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.960]   have issues with fertility
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.380]   because they are taking testosterone.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.940]   So their testosterone levels presumably
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.820]   are going to be high end normal or more,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.660]   but they are doing presumably
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.400]   not testosterone replacement therapy,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.540]   but they're doing what I call
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.300]   testosterone augmentation therapy,
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.020]   meaning they were somewhere in the 300 to 900 nanograms
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.100]   per deciliter range,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.240]   but decided to start taking testosterone anyway.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.340]   And then their sperm count essentially diminishes to nil
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.260]   or close to it.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.540]   - In some cases, yeah.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.340]   So, I mean, I think there's various reasons
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.340]   that you would take testosterone.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.100]   I think, you know, some people have been treated,
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.540]   you know, years ago,
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.340]   and so they do need to replace testosterone, you know,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.660]   but some people do it for augmentation.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.160]   I just usually say testosterone therapy just so it's correct.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.500]   - You kill the R, I like that.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.120]   That's better than the TAT,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.020]   which doesn't help very good.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.140]   - Okay, just testosterone therapy.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.980]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.900]   - But if you had, you know, for example,
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   we take a hundred of my infertile patients
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.400]   that come in to see me in clinic,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.740]   at least five of those men will be infertile
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.820]   because they're on testosterone therapy.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.000]   And some of them do have that suspicion.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.660]   They say, you know, I'm gonna level with you.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.020]   This is why my levels are probably low.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.700]   But a lot of men were not told that, you know,
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.540]   when they started therapy.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.380]   So I think certainly for reproductive age men,
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.120]   that's a very important conversation to have
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.260]   because there can be some other, you know,
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.340]   ways that we kind of maintain sperm production.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.420]   I think sperm cryopreservation is a good option
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.680]   for these men as well.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.780]   Or there may be other therapies they can think about
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.140]   just because of reproductive toxicity.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.580]   - What about HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin?
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.820]   I hear about a lot of people who go on testosterone therapy
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.140]   who take HCG every other day or so.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.980]   Typically the dosages that I hear about
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.060]   because people write to me about this stuff all the time.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.260]   Really, it's one of the most commonly asked questions.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.860]   I get many questions about many topics,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.860]   but I would say a full 10 to 20% of them
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.940]   are about penises or testosterone.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.340]   - Those are perfect though.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.820]   - Right, exactly.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   So a number of those guys who are taking testosterone
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.560]   will be prescribed HCG to stimulate sperm production,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.780]   endogenous sperm production to maintain healthy sperm,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.520]   presumably because they either want to conceive
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.440]   or intending to conceive in the future.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.500]   Is that the best line of treatment for maintaining fertility
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.660]   while people are taking testosterone therapy?
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.200]   - Yeah, that's one of the therapies that we use
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.240]   and I think it can work well.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.680]   Just a low dose usually, and for those that know,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.600]   500 to 1,000 units every other day is usually adequate.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.260]   - As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.420]   of course, our physical health,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.140]   but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.060]   our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.240]   And we know that one of the most important features
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.180]   of high quality nutrition is making sure
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.180]   that we get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.800]   from high quality unprocessed or minimally processed sources
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.900]   as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.960]   to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.820]   including the gut microbiome.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.940]   Now, I, like most everybody,
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.000]   try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.740]   ideally, mostly from minimally processed
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.180]   or non-processed foods.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.300]   However, one of the challenges
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.140]   that I and so many other people face
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.200]   is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.160]   and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.360]   that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.400]   That's why way back in 2012,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.240]   long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.840]   And so I'm delighted that AG1
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.000]   is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.740]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.040]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.820]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.360]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.180]   of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.240]   to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.400]   physical health, and performance.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.820]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.100]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.640]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.400]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.240]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.580]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.080]   to claim that special offer.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:01.760]   So if somebody is not taking testosterone exogenously,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.880]   they gotten their body fat level down
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.880]   to a point where they're not considered obese.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.580]   So they're hopefully doing some cardiovascular exercise
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.360]   each week, maybe doing some sport
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.100]   or some resistance training too
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.400]   with the intention of maintaining all around good health.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.080]   Stave off, you know, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular issues.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.880]   What are some of the other don'ts?
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.520]   I'm going to assume that smoking cigarettes
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.600]   or vaping cigarettes is bad.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.180]   There are any studies that look specifically
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.240]   at vaping and sperm quality or testosterone levels.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.140]   And is there any evidence that smoking cigarettes
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.320]   is good for testosterone levels or sperm production?
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.540]   'Cause I'm guessing the answer is no.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.200]   I feel like nowadays we just say don't smoke,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.080]   but the data are the data.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.800]   Who knows, maybe nicotine can help sperm.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   I have no idea.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.620]   - Right, it's possible.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.160]   I don't think we have the data on that yet,
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.000]   but yeah, I mean, I think like to your point,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.060]   I think lifestyle factors are certainly a big one.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.680]   And you know, some of these, you know,
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.900]   potentially, you know, kind of unhealthy habits.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.880]   So smoking is certainly something you should not do.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.280]   There have been, you know, lots of studies
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.960]   that do link that to, you know, lower quality.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.340]   Again, all the different measures that we look at.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.400]   Also looking at fertility,
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   these men tend to have a longer time to get pregnant.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.640]   Alcohol, I think is another very common question
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.600]   that we get asked as well.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.440]   And I think for that, there's, you know,
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.800]   I think less of a strong association that we've seen.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.680]   So there, you know, there have been some studies
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.360]   that show that very high levels of alcohol,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.600]   and I guess that's sort of subjective
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.480]   what some would consider higher or not.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.280]   But you know, when you get above maybe 20 drinks a week,
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.780]   there have been some effects.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.660]   But usually- - That's a lot of drinking.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.500]   - I would think that's a lot.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.760]   Yeah, but some people don't, but yeah.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.960]   - I did an episode on alcohol.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.560]   I think anything more than two,
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.200]   I know people are going to, you know, balk at this,
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.500]   but you know, I think any more than two drinks per week
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.720]   is where you start to see some negative effects
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.000]   on some health parameters.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.040]   But you know, I'm not a detotaller, so yeah.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.300]   - Yeah, but when you get to this 20 drink,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.040]   that's when we started to see some effects on semen quality.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.080]   But you know, the thing about that is that usually
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.400]   if these men are drinking 20,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.000]   they're doing other things too, smoking,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.820]   there can be other drug use as well.
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.120]   So it's hard to tease that out, but in general,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.940]   that's, you know, I think certainly anything in moderation
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.200]   is probably, you know, is probably better.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.460]   And so that's how I counsel patients.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.440]   I think, again, it's very rare that I see men
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.280]   that are at that level,
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.140]   but I certainly let them know when I do.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.200]   There's some new data coming out of,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.120]   that we've started to work on looking at
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.180]   if there are different sensitivities to alcohol.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.600]   So, you know, some East Asians have a mutation
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.220]   that leads to flushing.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.380]   And so that may put those men at higher risk.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.340]   When they mix alcohol, we may see some, you know,
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.680]   slightly lower sperm parameters.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.520]   - You mean skin flushing
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.660]   because they don't make alcohol dehydrogenase?
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.600]   - Exactly, yeah. - Is that the idea, yeah.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.500]   And is it, I've heard about that in Asian cultures,
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   is there, in Asian population, excuse me,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.980]   but is there any evidence that other populations
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.980]   might have slight variants on alcohol dehydrogenase
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.620]   that perhaps, maybe they don't lack it altogether,
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.100]   but they have, I don't know,
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.740]   there are hypomorphs for whatever gene
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.420]   makes alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.500]   and therefore they don't metabolize it as well,
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.980]   and therefore the toxic form of alcohol
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.820]   is active in their system longer.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.220]   Is there any evidence for that?
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.380]   - No, I think that you're exactly right.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.780]   I mean, I think the one that we think about
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.020]   is East Asian cultures, where it can be,
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.420]   you know, depending on, you know, the region,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.420]   like Chinese, Taiwanese, probably about 40 to 50%
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.620]   of the population has, you know,
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.620]   mutation in the ALDH2 gene,
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.020]   but other populations and people with African ancestry,
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.700]   there's a rate of mutation, I think,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.420]   I'm not gonna remember the exact percentage,
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.260]   but I think a few percentage points is some individual
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.280]   with Hispanic ancestry, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.300]   So in this particular gene, there's a mutation,
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.880]   not the same one that East Asians have,
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   but, you know, again, I think it gets to why a mutation,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.460]   you know, where we see sort of negative effects
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.420]   would persist and the hypothesis that, you know,
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.980]   millennia ago, pretend potentially, you know,
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.580]   gave some sort of benefit for maybe an infectious disease
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.540]   or something similar to cystic fibrosis.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.620]   Why, you know, again, this mutation would persist
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.140]   in our population if there's not, you know,
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.300]   some sort of advantage to those carrying it.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.700]   But we do see another, you know, other men as well.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.080]   So I think if, you know, it's a simple question,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.920]   do you flush?
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.200]   If you flush, then maybe alcohol may have, you know,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.380]   more of a harm than someone else.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.420]   And then, you know, I get sort of getting along the lines.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.420]   I think drug use is also something that we should try
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.820]   and, you know, we do counsel patients about
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.300]   'cause that can also negatively affect semen quality.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.240]   - Do you think it's fair to say that, okay,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.780]   moderation is best, but if somebody had the option
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.260]   to either not drink or drink in moderation
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.660]   that they should not drink, would that be even better?
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.900]   Is there any evidence for that?
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.540]   I mean, it seems like nowadays we take the stance
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.260]   that not smoking at all is better
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.380]   than smoking a little bit.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.180]   - Actually, when I was a postdoc at Stanford from 2005,
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.940]   yes, 2005 to end of 2010,
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.760]   you could still smoke on the Stanford campus.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.440]   I'm not a smoker, but there was this collection of,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.820]   I have to be careful what I say here.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.980]   There was a particular group on campus of postdocs
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.120]   and graduate students that would, you know,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.220]   that would colonize this little area outside the hospital
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.820]   and smoke because that's where you could smoke.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.060]   That was eventually eliminated as a possibility.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.300]   You can't smoke on Stanford campus as far as I know,
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.660]   but they would smoke right outside the hospital.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.660]   Actually, a lot of the hospital workers would, you know,
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.760]   take a cigarette on their break.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.500]   This is very common. - The irony, yeah, exactly.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   - Yeah, and this was common all over the country, right?
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.580]   This isn't unique to Stanford,
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.380]   but nowadays you just don't see that
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.580]   because it's not allowed.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.840]   And we here don't smoke.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.500]   It's terrible for XYZ and everything,
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.480]   every other letter of the alphabet.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.860]   With alcohol, we tend to hear that if you're going to drink,
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.980]   drink in moderation.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.880]   It's not clear exactly what number that is,
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.060]   but is it possible that zero alcohol
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.540]   is better for sperm and endocrine health than any alcohol?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.220]   Or is that not a fair assumption?
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.440]   - I mean, I think that's a good question.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.340]   I think, you know, your point about tobacco
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.660]   is an excellent one 'cause I think any smoking is bad.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.140]   But alcohol, I think we don't have that data for yet.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.540]   And so I think it's harder for me
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.900]   to make that recommendation to patients,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.060]   especially because, you know,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.500]   people do it for different reasons.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.940]   And if it's not necessarily going to help them,
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.680]   you know, it'll harm them in social situations
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.620]   or other things.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.020]   Yeah, I usually just, I usually give the moderation one,
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.100]   unless again, for the very high drinkers,
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.180]   I definitely talk about that.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.080]   - You mentioned other drug use.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.420]   I'm going to assume that unless prescribed
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.840]   for sort of post-surgical pain or something like that,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.840]   that benzodiazepines, heroin, opioids of any kind,
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.540]   are just bad for sperm and testosterone.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.020]   I think we could probably make that a short discussion.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.020]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.380]   - You know, I can't imagine any of that would be good
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.960]   for reproductive health.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.800]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.460]   I mean, there's, again, you'd imagine, or maybe not,
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.700]   but there's not a lot of data on it.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.180]   It'd be difficult to enroll or maybe easy to enroll,
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.700]   but a lot of those studies have not been done.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.260]   But there's limited ones of, you know,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.900]   people in rehab where they have shown, you know,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.380]   these associations with, you know,
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.640]   addicts or users and lower quality.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.200]   So yeah, that's how we talk to patients.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.140]   - What about cannabis?
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.000]   I did an episode of this podcast about cannabis
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.740]   and I did highlight some of the medical applications
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.660]   of cannabis.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.300]   I also highlighted that very high THC cannabis
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.380]   may predispose especially young males
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.260]   to later psychotic episodes.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.420]   There are more and more data coming out
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.460]   about that all the time.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.420]   I got a lot of flack for saying that,
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.300]   but that's my take on the data.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.740]   And I know a lot of people use cannabis recreationally
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.620]   and in a kind of pseudo therapeutic way.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.420]   I say pseudo therapeutic because I think a lot of people
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.680]   use cannabis to manage their anxiety
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.580]   and as an alternative to alcohol for a number of reasons.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.180]   What is the relationship between cannabis use
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.460]   and testosterone and sperm production?
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.940]   Or I should say sperm quality, excuse me.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.620]   - Yeah, so this is also a very common question.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.740]   Again, with this wave of legalization across the country,
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.760]   I think more and more men and women are exposed to it.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:18.660]   So again, there's data that even more men are exposed
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.760]   to it can lead to some harm in terms of sperm morphology
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.140]   and sperm numbers as well.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.480]   One of the sort of landmark studies was about 1200 men
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.820]   and it found that men that use cannabis daily
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.120]   had significantly lower concentration, motility, morphology
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.740]   compared to those that didn't use it.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.360]   So I think that's generally how men are counseled,
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.740]   but there's also other data that shows really a null effect.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.640]   And I think that it goes into probably the composition,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.700]   how men are taking it, the frequency,
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.760]   because a lot of that data is not well teased out
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.060]   in a lot of these studies.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:56.700]   So I think I sometimes struggle with this with patients
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.320]   because some of them are taking it for some what they
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.400]   consider legitimate reasons, anxiety, sleep, pain.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   And if there's not sort of very convincing evidence
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.100]   that it's going to help and they're taking it maybe lower
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.080]   than the threshold where I know that there's good data
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.840]   that'll cause harm.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.840]   I guess I try and be sort of honest about where we are,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.240]   but I think with a lot of things related to sperm,
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.120]   I think our level of evidence is not great.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.620]   - Are there any common over-the-counter medications
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.920]   that can negatively impact sperm quality and/or testosterone?
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.740]   Things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory,
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:38.520]   drugs, Tylenol, Advil type stuff, ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.620]   things of that sort that I and others might not be aware of.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.520]   I'm not probing for anything in particular here.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.200]   I just, I know that a lot of over-the-counter drugs
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.620]   have effects that we're just simply not aware of.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.420]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we probably need more data,
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.120]   but I think currently we think all of those are safe.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.000]   - I'm curious about the pituitary gland,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.840]   as many listeners of this podcast already know
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.500]   is a gland that receives signals from the brain.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.100]   The gland sits near the roof of the mouth.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.460]   I think that's fair.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.820]   And releases critical hormones into the bloodstream
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.120]   that control the output of testosterone from the testes
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.960]   as well as output of hormones from other glands.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.100]   I know a number of people end up playing sports
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   like football or rugby or even lacrosse or even soccer.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.520]   I've read there are data on this.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.840]   They're heading the soccer ball quite a lot
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.360]   or martial arts, or they get a head injury at some point.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.520]   And I certainly hear a lot from people
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.120]   who played these high contact sports
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.720]   and then to their surprise later,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.560]   they have diminished testosterone levels.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.900]   I also work with a number of military groups
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.420]   that talk about this, that they leave
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.840]   and maybe it's from combat related stress, et cetera,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.240]   but they wonder whether or not there's any
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.180]   traumatic head injury or maybe pituitary injury
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.200]   related impairment to the reproductive axis
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.640]   that includes brain, pituitary and the testes.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.560]   Do you see that?
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.840]   And if somebody played a contact sport,
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.800]   in particular a contact sport where the head was hit
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.600]   or they were hitting things with their head often,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.120]   or if they have a TBI or had a TBI,
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.920]   that their reproductive health can be impaired.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.440]   - That's fascinating, I have not.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.640]   I mean, I think it's interesting, I guess,
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.840]   what the pituitary does,
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.680]   you've obviously covered this before,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.560]   but it does go to a lot of our therapies.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.360]   I mean, so for your listeners,
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.440]   that pituitary produces two hormones,
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.280]   LH, luteinizing hormone and FSH,
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.000]   follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.340]   which then stimulates the testicle.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.440]   So the luteinizing hormone stimulates the late excels
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.000]   to make testosterone and then the follicle stimulating hormone
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.320]   or FSH stimulates sperm production.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.280]   So both of those are very key in terms of production.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.840]   And interestingly, when exogenous testosterone is used,
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.560]   it shuts down that axis, as you know,
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.880]   so we get less of these gonadotropins, this LH, FSH,
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.960]   to stimulate the testicle.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.780]   And the other sort of reason that sperm production is lost
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.920]   with exogenous testosterone uses it
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.960]   is actually the intratesticular testosterone
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.420]   is much higher than serum levels.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   So, you know, our serum levels are between 300 to 900
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.740]   nanograms per deciliter on average,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.700]   but in the testicle are probably 10 fold higher at least.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.740]   So when men are given exogenous testosterone
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.020]   and they're not producing their own,
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.500]   the levels of testosterone in the testicle,
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.240]   which are necessary for sperm production
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.440]   are much, much lower.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.160]   But it's interesting 'cause I think,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.780]   I am not aware of sort of how traumatic injuries
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.980]   would do that.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.600]   - Okay, that's good to know.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   I'm curious about the non-endocrine,
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:06.880]   non-chemical effects on sperm quality
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.560]   and testosterone levels.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.280]   So here I'm thinking about a bunch of news stories
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.880]   we heard a few years ago about how bicycle seat pressure
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.920]   on the prostate, or maybe it was other portions of the,
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.720]   it was the nerves running to the penis itself
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.920]   or surrounding areas, maybe it was pelvic floor related
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.500]   and somehow you'll tell us I'm sure,
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.660]   was impairing sexual function.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.880]   Was it impairing sexual function in any way
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.760]   by impairing testosterone levels,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.860]   cutting off blood flow to the testes?
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.200]   And here, perhaps the most important thing to ask
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.340]   straight off is, is riding a bicycle bad
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.880]   for male reproductive health and sexual health?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.000]   - Yeah, these are great questions.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.960]   These are, again, living in the Bay Area,
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   working in the Bay Area, cycling is very, very popular.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.860]   So these are questions that I get a lot.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.400]   So I think, in general, like we talked about before,
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.560]   anything that's good for your heart,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.140]   it's gonna be good for fertility.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.060]   So good diet and exercise, maintaining good body weight.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.460]   And so I always try and encourage physical fitness.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.100]   I think that's important.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:13.840]   But it may be possible that some particular activities
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.740]   may put men at more risk.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.560]   So I think cycling could be one of them
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.400]   if, but it would sort of depend on exactly
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.920]   why we think that may be a problem.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.720]   So I guess the theory is heat.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.360]   If you're in the saddle for a long time,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   for these prolonged rides that men take on weekends, hours,
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.540]   that may be if there's too much heat exposure,
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.000]   that may be the mechanism where sperm production
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.840]   would decline.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.880]   So there have been some studies that say
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.960]   maybe five hours a week would be, that may be too much.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.240]   So if you're above that level,
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.360]   the sperm counts have shown to be lower.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.800]   If you're less than that, that may be okay.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.160]   So when I talk to patients about it,
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.440]   I try and just encourage them to stand up in the saddle
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.280]   to try and again, sort of air things out
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.520]   to try and dissipate heat.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.760]   If that's the mechanism we're gonna think.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.440]   Regarding sexual dysfunction,
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.200]   that is thought to be pressure as you're alluding to.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.400]   So the way that the saddle is configured,
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.720]   ideally all the pressure is put on our ischial tuberosity
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.660]   that are our sit bones.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.380]   That's what I'm sitting on now.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.320]   But on the saddle, there's obviously kind of the rigid nose.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.800]   And if there's too much pressure on that,
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.200]   that actually squeezes between the ischial tuberosities
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.720]   where the main blood flow to the penis goes
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.240]   and the main nerve supply is too.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.760]   And so if there's compression on this,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.880]   you get this sort of lack of blood flow or ischemia
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.200]   and you can get a nerve practice as well
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.460]   if you crush these nerves.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.320]   And so that over time can lead to problems.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.520]   So some patients will say that after I cycle,
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.640]   things are numb down there for 30 minutes or a day,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.880]   or I don't get erections for that sort of same amount
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.000]   of time, or sometimes men just sort of ride through it
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.160]   and hopefully things come back in a day or two.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.480]   So that could be the mechanism.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.200]   There are some saddles that hopefully
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   there'll be a little safer.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.840]   And I think that this sort of first was noted
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.720]   probably around 2000 or so.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.200]   And there is a big redesign in terms of saddles
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.440]   to try and make them a little bit more anatomically correct
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.680]   to try and minimize some of this.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.120]   And there's cycle fit that can be done or saddle fit
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.960]   rather that can be done at some of the cycling shops
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.340]   to try and look at your body position,
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.260]   look at your size and try and find a saddle that's safer.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.000]   This doesn't happen to everybody.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   I would say maybe if you were to serve a cyclist,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.920]   maybe 20 to 30% of men and women
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.360]   tend to be susceptible to this.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.720]   So I think if you are having discomfort when you cycle,
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.680]   whether it be pain, numbness, or you notice dysfunction,
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.920]   I think certainly you should think about changing saddles
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.240]   or think about changing riding style.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.140]   There's other strategies that are sometimes used,
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.920]   but it's absolutely something
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.440]   that everybody should be aware of.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.520]   - I meant to ask this earlier,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.440]   but I seem to recall a study that drew a correlation
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.780]   between amount of walking and maybe it was sperm quality,
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.960]   but I think it was testosterone levels,
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.080]   maybe some other metrics of male sexual health.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.500]   Forgive me, I'm not recalling the details now.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:15.640]   Is there any evidence that walking more, standing more,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.760]   maybe even using a standing desk is beneficial
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   for pelvic floor health, blood flow, prostate health,
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.800]   who knows, could be any and all of those things
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.640]   in some way that is beneficial for sperm quality,
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.400]   testosterone level, and/or overall male sexual health?
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.540]   - Yeah, I think one of the ways
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.960]   that we can characterize activity is step count, right?
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.640]   I think I have a watch that tells me that,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.840]   it's something that I look at every day
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.960]   and kind of strive for it.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.380]   And it turns out that the more active you are,
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.760]   it's been shown sort of looking at large national data pools
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.000]   across different age ranges
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.340]   that it is associated with testosterone levels.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.400]   So being more active, I think, is very important.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.040]   And that's another thing that everybody can do
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.020]   to try and improve sort of testicular function broadly,
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.800]   but testosterone specifically.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.540]   - And do you know whether or not that can be separated out
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.240]   from the relationship between being more active
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.480]   and less obese?
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.660]   I mean, is this something that's independent of obesity?
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.040]   In other words, can we incentivize people to walk more
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:21.040]   simply on the promise of improved sexual health?
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.080]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.360]   Sexual health will be a different one,
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.480]   but we can, I think there is association
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.920]   between testosterone levels and step count
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.280]   across different BMI straight up.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.040]   So I think whether you have the ideal body weight,
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.700]   whether you have a few pounds to lose, perhaps,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.060]   if you walk more, you will see higher levels of testosterone.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.540]   - And another question I meant to ask earlier,
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.020]   and then we can close the hatch
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.860]   on exogenous testosterone therapy,
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.940]   at least for the time being, maybe we'll come back to it,
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:50.340]   is assuming that somebody
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.860]   can maintain adequate sperm production
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.700]   through the use of HCG or some other therapy,
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.020]   or perhaps they don't care if they're still making sperm
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.620]   'cause they've already had children
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.780]   or they don't care to have children,
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.860]   maybe they bank sperm, in any event,
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.820]   assuming that somebody takes testosterone therapy
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.960]   because they were prescribed that,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.220]   let's say in your clinic,
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.180]   let's just use you and your clinic as an example,
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.760]   and they are happy with the psychological
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.280]   and physical consequences of that,
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.320]   and they are comfortable with the trade-offs,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   is there any increased risk of, say, prostate cancer
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.000]   or other forms of cancer?
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.580]   And here, I'm going to assume that this person
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.820]   is keeping their lipid levels in check,
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.300]   right, 'cause you hear about some hyperlipidemia
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.420]   with testosterone therapies.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.580]   Let's assume that they're either taking a statin
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.500]   or they're not taking a statin,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.220]   and they're getting enough cardiovascular exercise,
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.100]   that things are in check in terms of LDL, HDL, APOB,
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.580]   and all of that,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.020]   and their testosterone levels are now high normal,
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.380]   and they're feeling better,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.860]   and they don't have to worry about sperm production
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.400]   'cause they're either maintaining it or it's been banked
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.700]   or they don't care about that.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.060]   Is there an increased risk of prostate cancer?
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.580]   My understanding is the answer is no,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.420]   but what's the real deal?
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.940]   Does taking testosterone therapy,
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.580]   assuming all other things are being held in check,
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.880]   in a healthy check,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.860]   does it increase the risk of any kind of cancer?
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.780]   - Yeah, I mean, this is another great question
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.020]   because I think there's a lot of myths around testosterone,
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.620]   and that's one of them.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.700]   The origin is that prostate cancer is thought to be,
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.100]   or is, sort of androgen-mediated.
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.620]   One of the Nobel Prizes, again, decades ago,
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.900]   was awarded because it was found
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.100]   that when we lowered a man's testosterone,
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.660]   the prostate cancer would regress dramatically,
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.220]   so that put that association
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.360]   between testosterone and prostate cancer.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.180]   So then the concern began if we were
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.060]   to either replace testosterone or augment testosterone
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.100]   and give a man testosterone,
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.500]   is that gonna alter his risk or increase his risk?
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.580]   So I think we have pretty convincing data
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.980]   that that's not the case.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.700]   You know, there's lots of longitudinal data spanning decades
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.180]   where if a man is given testosterone,
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.600]   it doesn't change his risk.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.480]   The reason for that, in a sort of seeming contradiction,
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.780]   you know, this contradiction
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.060]   between prostate cancer therapy
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.980]   where we lower testosterone,
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.300]   where if you give a man testosterone,
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.960]   it doesn't change his prostate cancer risk,
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.040]   is not certain, but there's this popular model
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.340]   called the saturation model,
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.500]   so that once there's enough testosterone in the body,
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.300]   and it tends to be a fairly low level,
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.860]   that all the sort of the prostate testosterone receptors,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.980]   you know, you can kind of think of as have been filled.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.700]   So if you were to give a man more testosterone,
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.020]   it doesn't change anything regarding the prostate cancer,
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.720]   prostate growth, any of that.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.740]   So it is safe when we're looking at prostate cancer
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.220]   as an outcome.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.820]   - I'd like to just take a brief break
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.660]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.100]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.340]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.940]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.780]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.620]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.460]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:01.100]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.340]   also called neurons.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.700]   Now, people of course have varying levels of requirements
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.700]   for sodium, so people with hypertension or prehypertension
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.700]   probably shouldn't increase their sodium.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.620]   However, many people are surprised to find
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.540]   that by increasing their sodium intake,
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.260]   they are able to function better cognitively and physically,
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.180]   and that's because a lot of people,
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.340]   especially people who are following low carbohydrate
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.060]   or even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets,
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.660]   oftentimes they're excreting a lot of water
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.860]   and electrolytes along with it,
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.100]   and simply by increasing their electrolyte intake
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.920]   using Element, they just feel better and function better.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.980]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.100]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.880]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.140]   And while I do any kind of physical training,
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.980]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.460]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:45.120]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.100]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element,
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.700]   that's lmnt.com/huberman
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.000]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.060]   Again, that's drink element lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.860]   Getting back to prostate health
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.940]   and neural innervation of the penis
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.420]   and blood flow to the penis,
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.180]   you mentioned the bike seat related issues.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.600]   Are there other things that men should do
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.140]   in order to maintain prostate health,
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.280]   stave off prostate diseases,
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.500]   and to maintain healthy blood flow
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.960]   and neural innervation of the penis for obvious reasons?
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.140]   And we'll get into the specifics of those reasons
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.200]   in our later discussion.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.540]   I always kind of think of the penis as a user
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.380]   to lose an organ.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.800]   So that doesn't mean necessarily that you have to have sex,
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.580]   but normally we get erections every night,
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.900]   so that should be maintained.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.680]   And if there's any reason to sort of suspect
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.400]   that that may not be going on,
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.180]   usually in my practice, that would be from
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.180]   some pelvic surgical intervention or something like that.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.840]   Sometimes we can intervene to try and maintain that.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.820]   - You're talking about spontaneous erections during sleep.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.040]   So, and short of assigning one's partner
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.800]   to check frequency intumescence,
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.080]   what is the way that men would know that that's happening?
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Are you talking about waking up with an erection?
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.880]   Is that a requisite for knowing
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.180]   that nocturnal erections are occurring?
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.220]   - Well, yeah, I think you, yeah, you kind of caught me.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.120]   I think that's a good question.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.040]   So I think a lot of times you won't know,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.140]   but I think if you have sort of normal response,
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:22.160]   when either by yourself with a partner,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.920]   I think that generally means
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.420]   that you are gonna get normal erection.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.260]   So I think, I guess when I say use it or lose it,
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.200]   it doesn't mean necessarily that the man
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.960]   has to stimulate himself or kind of make sure
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.900]   that he does have adequate function,
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.960]   because usually most of that normal function
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.880]   just occurs with his nocturnal penile tumescence,
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.000]   which we all get.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.280]   I think sometimes men do notice
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.240]   when they wake up at night.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   Sometimes in the morning you wake up with an erection
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.120]   and men notice that, but the absence of that
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.180]   doesn't mean it's not happening.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.520]   It likely is, just most people sleep through it,
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   which is normal.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.320]   Otherwise, men would never get any sleep
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.260]   because it happens many, many times a night.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.080]   So I think, again, if you're not having normal function,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.320]   I think that's something you should probably see
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.720]   a physician about.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.760]   And then same for urinary function.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.120]   I think if it bothers you, if you're waking up at night,
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.600]   you have to go to the bathroom often,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.680]   if your stream is getting weaker,
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.760]   those are all sort of complaints that we hear about.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.900]   - What is often, my understanding is that it's normal
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.120]   to wake up perhaps once during the night to urinate.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.140]   And this is, of course, assuming,
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.880]   and again, forgive me for all the caveats,
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.840]   but I've done this long enough that, you know,
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.760]   if I don't get really granular about some of this,
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.240]   then she would say, well, what if I drank, you know,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.100]   32 ounces of fluid right before sleep
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.960]   and I'm urinating three times per night?
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.860]   Well, we're assuming that people are tapering
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.320]   their liquid intake as they approach bedtime.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.020]   And that waking up once, maybe twice,
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.880]   but once in the middle of the night to urinate
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.940]   is normal for somebody, let's say age, I don't know,
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   18 to 40 and maybe from 40 to 100,
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.880]   that number might be in the one to two times per night.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.840]   Is that about right?
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I think once a night, yeah,
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.040]   is normal for most men.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.000]   And then I think, you know, if things start to bother you,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.980]   I think you could certainly see somebody,
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.480]   but it's hard to get better than once or twice a night
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.320]   for most men.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.380]   - My understanding is that there's a pretty good relationship
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:20.200]   between the nocturnal erection and the amount of REM sleep,
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.840]   rapid eye movement sleep that one is getting,
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.900]   that this tends to be more frequent toward morning
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.560]   as the proportion of rapid eye movement sleep increases.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   I don't know if that's true or not,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.360]   but I found a couple of studies that at least point
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.280]   in that direction, no pun intended.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.440]   So that raises a bigger issue
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.600]   that we haven't talked about yet,
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.980]   which is getting adequate amounts of quality sleep
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.920]   each night.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.160]   And I think for most people that's seven to nine hours,
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.440]   ideally, which means getting sufficient slow wave,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.600]   deep sleep, as well as rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.740]   But nowadays, a lot of people, including young people
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.720]   who are not working excessive hours are getting, you know,
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.120]   four or five, six hours of sleep per night.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.660]   Is there a direct relationship between getting less
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.080]   than sufficient amounts of sleep
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.480]   and sperm quality, testosterone levels and sexual health?
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.440]   - Yeah, I mean, I think certainly there's reasonable data
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.960]   for semen quality.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.580]   And there tends to be, you know, we call like in science,
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.920]   sort of a U-shaped relationship
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.340]   so that it's not sort of linear.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.440]   So as you get more sleep, things are better.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.560]   There's sort of, there's this concept of too much sleep
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.720]   and not enough sleep.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.420]   So the ideal, I think, as you pointed out,
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.840]   is seven to nine hours.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.400]   And for men that are not getting that,
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.720]   semen quality tends to be lower.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.760]   And then for men getting too much, we also see a decline.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.480]   And you know, why that is, is again, not certain.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.640]   Again, if you're able to get that much sleep,
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.320]   maybe there's other things as well that we should look at.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.680]   But so I think kind of getting in that ideal sleep amount
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.760]   is best for semen quality
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.360]   and probably for broad testicular function as well.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.640]   - You keep bringing up semen quality
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.160]   in a way that makes me wonder whether or not,
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.040]   is semen quality a proxy for overall vitality and health?
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.660]   Or is testosterone level a proxy
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.760]   for overall vitality and health?
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.020]   It sounds like semen quality is the metric
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.120]   that you keep coming back to in a way that,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.760]   I have to assume reflects your clinical experience
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.540]   and the many papers that you've authored in this area.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.440]   I think for people that hear semen quality
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.320]   and who are not interested in conceiving children now,
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.120]   or who are, which of course could include
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.360]   people who've already had children
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.720]   or who don't want children,
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.880]   semen quality sounds like something
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.200]   that relates to fertility.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.960]   But is semen quality something that is a good goal
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.120]   for those who are interested
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.000]   in overall male vitality and health?
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.780]   Is it one of the better metrics
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.360]   of overall male vitality and health?
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.120]   - Well, I think, you know,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.400]   I think it's an excellent marker for overall health.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.520]   I think there are studies that support,
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.960]   it can be a measure of how healthy you are.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.120]   You know, if you look at men with more health problems,
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.720]   they can have lower semen quality.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.640]   But also if you look at semen quality just by itself,
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.540]   and then you look into the future, how these men tend to do.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.240]   If they have higher semen quality,
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.640]   they tend to live longer, need to go to the doctor less,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.800]   lower rates of cancer.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.780]   So I think there's a lot of different ways
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.920]   that semen quality may be a good barometer of health.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.400]   You know, why that link exists I think is not known,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.600]   but there's lots of theories.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.720]   So one is that probably about 10% of the male genome
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.460]   is devoted to reproduction.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.160]   And so it makes sense given that we only have
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.600]   about 24,000 genes in the body,
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.800]   that there's a lot of overlap.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.060]   So one gene that plays a role in reproduction
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.000]   may play a role in the cardiovascular system
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.280]   or the neurological system.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.000]   And so if we get the first sort of sign
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.720]   that reproduction is not perfect,
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.640]   there may be some other health consequences down the line.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.440]   Another sort of hypothesis is that,
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.840]   again, sort of going along this line
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.200]   that reproduction is one of the first things that we see
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.600]   is that gestation is sort of very critical
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.200]   to our existence, right?
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.640]   And perturbations to that system have prolonged effects.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.740]   So the so-called sort of developmental origin
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:21.800]   of adult disease or the Barker hypothesis.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.840]   And so we know that premature children
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   have higher risk of cardiovascular disease,
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.440]   there have been studies to show that.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.760]   But we also know that these gestational effects
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.980]   can also play out on reproductive function too.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.000]   So that also may be kind of a link,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.880]   sort of early seeding of reproductive function.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.620]   And then that's maybe the first marker
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.240]   that we're gonna have for other health effects later on.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.000]   There are also just sort of inherent sort of similarities
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.480]   between reproduction and some other sort of social effects.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.680]   So kind of one sort of confounding factor
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.080]   when we're looking at some of these studies,
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.400]   I talked about looking at mortality, for example,
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.520]   and semen quality, is that there's sort of factors
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.380]   that necessarily involve reproduction.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.280]   So children and having a partner.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.580]   And having a partner prolongs life,
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.540]   having kids prolong life.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.360]   Even though it feels like kids are killing you,
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.420]   if you look at studies, men with kids tend to live longer.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.300]   So that's another possible explanation.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.460]   But I think really sort of this health link
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.540]   between fertility I think is sort of a powerful one.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.900]   So I do think it should be a barometer.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.660]   I think that it should be a sort of,
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.020]   when I've given lectures on this,
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.260]   I call it the six vital sign.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.400]   I think it's something that we should probably check
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.720]   because if there is sort of lower levels,
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.120]   that may tell us about something else going on.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.660]   When men come in from fertility evaluations,
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.020]   a lot of times we do diagnose these new medical problems.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.100]   Sometimes we diagnose cancer,
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.740]   sort of alluding to some of the questions you've asked,
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.360]   diabetes and some other
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.500]   very significant genetic conditions as well.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.260]   And the first way that we would identify it
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.660]   is reproductive failure
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.780]   because their sperm counts are low and other things.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.260]   So it is something I think that it's sort of,
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.020]   it's very important I think for people to realize,
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.820]   and it would be great I think.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.820]   Another I think advantage to like the Centers for Disease
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.540]   Control, for example, to start tracking it.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:23.100]   - Would it be a good idea for males in their 20s and 30s
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.080]   to get a sperm analysis just to have a baseline?
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.580]   I confess I'm 47 now.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.280]   One thing I wish I had done in my 20s
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.340]   was to get my blood hormone profiles and lipid profiles done
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.600]   when I was in my teens and 20s
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.580]   because I'd have something to compare to.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.900]   I started doing that in my mid 30s
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   and I'm so glad I did
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.540]   because I can now compare to my mid 30s levels.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.540]   I started including sperm analysis about eight years ago
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.460]   with the intention of freezing sperm.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.300]   And I did that because I was also reading at that time
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.840]   about the increased risk of autism
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.280]   in offspring of males older than 40,
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.460]   something that I really would like your take on.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.100]   But it seems like it's inexpensive enough
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.140]   to do a sperm analysis.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.820]   I think now people can get it done at home.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.060]   They have male kits,
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.160]   although I don't understand how the motility
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.260]   could be maintained if you're mailing your sperm back
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:20.340]   at room temperature or it's heading through the post office.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.240]   Now everyone's imagining all these sperm traveling
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.020]   through the postal service.
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.280]   They're out there folks.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.460]   Yeah, what are your thoughts?
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.660]   Should people invest the,
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.140]   I think it was a couple hundred dollars
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.280]   to get a sperm analysis more costly
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.820]   to get the DNA fragmentation
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   than you get up into the low thousands.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.020]   But if people have the disposable income,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.200]   is it a good idea for them to do?
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.640]   - I mean, I think it's a worthwhile test.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.700]   I think more information is always good.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.260]   I think sort of one of the same reasons
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.140]   that you're talking about checking like lipid levels
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.760]   or we tell men and women to get blood pressure checked.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.340]   I think getting that sort of early health indicator
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.660]   I think can be important.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.980]   I think going back to not knowing exactly
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.260]   why semen quality is telling us about health,
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.180]   what the exact link may be,
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.740]   it means that if somebody is coming in
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:13.940]   with a low sperm count or completely absent sperm count,
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.580]   it's hard to know exactly how to counsel that person
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.940]   other than there may be reproductive difficulties.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.040]   But I think just as sort of a marker
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.340]   for reproductive potential, I think it's useful.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.300]   And like you said, I think it's become a lot easier.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   One of the sort of innovations in the space
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.680]   and somebody that is in the reproductive world,
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.540]   I think it's just really great to see
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.820]   sort of this influx in capital and new companies coming in
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.680]   that try to just decrease the barrier
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.300]   to getting a semen test.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.660]   It used to be you have to go to a lab,
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.180]   schedule an appointment.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.720]   Sometimes they would send you to a bathroom,
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.300]   which can be uncomfortable
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.620]   'cause people are doing, you know,
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:49.980]   people doing a bathroom just next to you
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.820]   where you're trying to collect.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.540]   - Oh, they would send them in a common space bathroom.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.980]   They wouldn't even give them the quiet room
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.300]   with the red light, which is what I hear they do now.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.260]   - Some of them do have video.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.860]   So there are some higher level.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.100]   - Oh, I didn't even mean videos.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.840]   I just, I think that, okay, yes, I've done this.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.220]   I'll just say, I mean, I've been trying to normalize things
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.200]   related to all aspects of mental health, physical health.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.080]   So yeah, I decided to free sperm.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.980]   And basically they sent me to a room.
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.420]   I went to a university-based clinic.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.440]   It actually wasn't Stanford, but different university.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.680]   And yeah, they put the cup through the window.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.520]   They give you the cup.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.040]   They close the door and they tell you
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.080]   that as long as that red light is on over the door,
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.100]   no one's going to walk in and then they leave.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.260]   And I think the assumption now is that you figure it out
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.680]   one way or another, how to provide the sample.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.640]   And then you put the sample back through the thing.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.680]   And then one thing these clinics really need to work out
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.520]   is that anytime you're walking out,
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.240]   you see the people processing your sample as you walk out.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   So there's all this feigning of anonymity,
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.400]   but really it isn't there.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.420]   'Cause they're like, "See you later."
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.380]   And you're like, "Great."
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.060]   They rarely ask you questions on the way out,
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.980]   but it's a pretty simple process overall.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.040]   And I must say that the data are informative.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.100]   You get the volume, number, motile, forwardly motile.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:16.620]   I did opt for the DNA fragmentation data.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.160]   And I just love data.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.520]   So I think it's really interesting.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.400]   But again, maybe this is a good time to flag
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.920]   this set of findings.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.320]   I believe that there seems to be a small,
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.860]   but statistically significant increase
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.360]   in the number of autistic births due to pregnancies
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   where the male was over 40 at the time of conception.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.640]   So I figured, why not free some sperm
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.520]   and it's relatively inexpensive?
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.020]   - Yeah, so I think paternal age is also something
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.820]   that's increasing in this country.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.620]   So over the last 40 years or so,
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.540]   we've seen that the average paternal age has increased
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.100]   from about 27 and a half to about 31.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.140]   And I should say that this is all fathers.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.440]   So birth certificate data or birth data
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.860]   is collected at maternal level.
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.440]   So when a child is born,
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.880]   somebody comes in to collect data on the birth.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   So they ask all the characteristics of the mother
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.360]   and they also ask characteristics of the father.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.400]   Age, education, obviously region of the country
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.100]   the child was born.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.080]   So we don't know what number child that was for the father.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:21.920]   We know it for the mother.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.440]   They do ask, is this your first, second, third, et cetera,
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.420]   child?
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.160]   So the father, unfortunately we just have data
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.920]   that sort of all lumped together.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.740]   But over the last, again, 40 years, we've seen that increase.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.240]   Interesting over the last 40 years,
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.160]   the youngest father was 11 and the oldest was 88.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.700]   - 11? - Quite a span, yeah.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.480]   - 88? - Mm-hmm.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.000]   - Goodness, unrelated.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.360]   - I don't know, I assume, I assume.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.880]   - Goodness. - It's anonymized data,
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.440]   but I assume. - 11.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.760]   I have to ask this, sorry to take us on a slight tangent,
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.360]   but what is the average age of puberty in males
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.040]   in the United States now?
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.560]   - Yeah, so you're asking about, I guess, sort of spermarchy,
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.280]   when like sperm production begins.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.440]   So- - Yeah, there are a lot
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.240]   of markers of puberty, secondary sexual characteristics
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.640]   of beard growth, deepening of voice, et cetera.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.120]   They happen at different rates in different people,
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.520]   but yeah, thank you.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:17.520]   At what point are, yeah, males undergoing puberty
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.120]   at the level of, that we're talking about here?
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.200]   - Yeah, so it's, yeah, there has been data
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.360]   that we're going through puberty a little bit earlier now
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.720]   than we used to, but it really varies.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.320]   So I think it's not, just like testosterone ranges
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.920]   between like 300 and 900, it's a wide range for anybody.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   I think for most individuals, puberty is probably 12
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.800]   to kind of 15, 16 in general.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.260]   So I just give sort of a very wide range
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.560]   when we're gonna say that's okay.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.480]   And some of the data I'm basing it on
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.840]   is when sperm production begins in boys.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.360]   And it's actually not that simple to be able
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.400]   to figure that out because we don't generally talk
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.440]   to young boys about how to masturbate,
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.240]   how to collect and then check on that.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.340]   But there's something called first morning voided urine
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.760]   where we can actually look at that.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.280]   And there have been some studies done
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.720]   and they see if there were sort of nocturnal emissions,
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720]   whether there's sperm in there.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.320]   And so generally it probably starts around,
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.340]   the earliest would be kind of 11, 12, 13,
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.160]   but usually most is probably a little later.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.560]   So maybe I'll refine that puberty
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.960]   and move it a little bit later, probably 14 to 16
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.680]   is when probably about 70, 80% of boys
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.100]   are gonna have started producing sperm.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.980]   - My understanding is that in females,
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.680]   puberty is also shifting earlier,
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.800]   perhaps at a more dramatic rate
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.940]   than appears to be the case for males.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.880]   - Well, I think there is some data for males too.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.480]   I think, but again, for your listeners,
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.320]   I don't wanna have this onslaught of pediatricians
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.400]   seeing kids that haven't, when boys haven't gone
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.200]   through puberty by a certain age.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.820]   So I think it's still fairly wide.
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.520]   - Let's get back to age of the father
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.800]   and issues like autism.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.600]   What are the data there?
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.880]   And this to me is a practical issue
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.800]   because I think if there's one obvious takeaway
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.920]   from our discussion today,
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.400]   it's that males should probably not wait
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.260]   until they're trying to conceive
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.040]   in order to assess their reproductive health
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.600]   at the level of sperm quality, testosterone levels, perhaps,
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.900]   but at least sperm quality.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.680]   But perhaps men should also be freezing their sperm
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.760]   if in fact conceiving children after 40
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.840]   places their children at far greater risk for autism.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.660]   I mean, my understanding is that the rates of autism
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:38.800]   are somewhere between one and 80.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.940]   You'll hear as high as one in 50 male births,
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.320]   but I think it's probably more like one in 60 to 80.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.340]   Is that about right?
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   And that the age of the father is a risk factor.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.040]   - Yeah, I think that this gets into sort of the larger issue
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.600]   of how men sort of perceive fertility.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.260]   So we know that as women age fertility declines,
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.060]   but the oldest father ever is 96.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:03.080]   So the biologic potential certainly persists.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.160]   - Wait, I want to know how long he lived
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.680]   to see how long his child would grow up.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.760]   He conceived at 96?
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.240]   - Supposedly, supposedly, yeah.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.360]   - Well, I'm assuming he did not meet his grandchildren,
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.200]   at least not the grandchild of that child.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.980]   So, wow, how long did he live?
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:22.380]   - Well, so this is a man in India.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.640]   It's just sort of a famous story,
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.080]   but supposedly he had a child.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.440]   He had that child with him on,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.540]   like they're waiting at a bus stop.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.380]   He fell asleep.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.280]   The child was kidnapped and led to divorce.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.700]   So yeah, sort of a horrible end,
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   but the wife was also old, not that old, but in her 50s.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.640]   So yeah.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.960]   - Wow, tragic and incredible story for separate reasons.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.900]   Okay, I'll get my head around this 96 year old
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.240]   conceiving a child.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.720]   Okay, please continue, yeah.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.280]   - So people, I think, or men think that the,
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.280]   sort of the fertile road is sort of infinite,
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.620]   but I think that's very much not the case.
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:07.760]   So as you're alluding to,
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.560]   people have looked into risks for older fathers.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.220]   So about a hundred years ago,
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.780]   I was first noticed that dwarfism or chondroplasia
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.440]   was more common in last born children.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.380]   So eventually that link was made.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.540]   And since then, other conditions too.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.540]   So there's like these neuropsychiatric conditions
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:27.180]   you're talking about, like autism is certainly one,
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.220]   bipolar schizophrenia, people have looked at
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.180]   and also linked that with older age,
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:34.100]   you know, less attainment in school,
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:35.420]   you know, failing grades,
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.060]   all that has been shown to be a little bit more common
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.420]   with older fathers.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.700]   So, you know, why I think all of these exist,
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.940]   there can be sort of different explanations.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.500]   You know, one explanation for the autism association,
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.260]   I'll talk about, you know, some of this more genetic
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.440]   or kind of mutational reasons,
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.240]   but one thing that some people say is that, you know,
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.020]   it could be sort of a hereditary trait.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.660]   And so it may be that, you know,
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.580]   men that display some sort of autistic characteristics,
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.120]   you know, maybe they take a little longer to meet a partner.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.380]   And so it sort of delayed child-bearing.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:14.300]   So maybe that's one possible explanation.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.140]   But I think, you know,
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.940]   there's been a lot of convincing evidence
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:17.800]   that there could be, you know,
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.380]   real epigenetic changes that occur with age
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.640]   and mutational changes that occur with age.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.500]   I think I read a statistic and you would know more
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.740]   being a neuroscientist that 84% of the genes
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.080]   in our body are expressed somewhere
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.020]   in the central nervous system.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.340]   Does that make you- - Sounds about right.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.180]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.500]   - I don't want to stamp my name to that,
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.020]   but that sounds about right.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.420]   - So it's estimated that every year
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:48.420]   we generate about two mutations in our, you know, sperm DNA.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.220]   So you can imagine that, you know,
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.700]   a 40-year-old is gonna have, you know,
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:57.700]   20 or 40 more mutations than a 20-year-old.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:58.940]   So that rate does go up.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.400]   And if you're just randomly sprinkling mutations,
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.980]   you know, in, you know, a genome,
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.980]   that they're more likely to sort of manifest
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.300]   in, you know, maybe neuropsychiatric conditions.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:13.140]   So there are, you know, data, convincing data
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.360]   that shows that that does occur.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.860]   Now, again, there's billions of base pairs in the body.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.160]   So these random mutations, likely most of them
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.540]   will not result in anything,
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:21.840]   but there can be some meaningful ones.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.320]   So for example, a chondroplasia is due to a mutation
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.380]   in fibroblast growth factor receptor.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.120]   And what's interesting is that this condition
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.720]   is not that rare, right?
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.320]   Based on sort of these rare mutations,
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.140]   you'd expect this would, you know,
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.160]   occur maybe about one in 100 million,
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.760]   but it turns out these conditions occur
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.920]   in about one in, I think, 30 to 50,000 or so.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.240]   So there's sort of this discrepancy
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.720]   based on sort of mutational rate that we expect
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.980]   based on age and the rate that we actually see.
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.720]   So the explanation for this is something called
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.960]   selfish spermatogonial selection.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.400]   So what this suggests is that some of these mutations
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.840]   that occur randomly occur in proliferation pathways.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.000]   And so it gives the sperm that contain these
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.240]   sort of advantages over their, you know,
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.440]   brothers and sisters that don't have them, for example.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.560]   And so then they out-compete the other sperm,
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.340]   and so they're more likely to lead to a child
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.200]   rather than sort of a random smattering.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.800]   You can actually see that some of these mutations
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:18.240]   are more common in older men than younger men
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.280]   if you look, you screen for some of these mutations
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.140]   in some of these pathways.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.180]   Again, the longer that we're exposed to life,
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:26.640]   there's just more likely to be, you know,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.600]   different chemical exposures, other exposures.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.200]   And so people have looked at epigenetic signatures,
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.760]   sort of these signatures that, you know,
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.600]   that dictate which genes are gonna be expressed
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.740]   and which aren't.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:37.780]   And there are different patterns
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.240]   between older and younger fathers.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.580]   And, you know, what triggering those is not known,
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.840]   but there are differences.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.040]   So those could also potentially explain, you know,
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.680]   some of these risks that we see.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.440]   You know, it used to be that people thought that,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.640]   you know, if you're an older father,
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.600]   maybe there's a lot of advantages,
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.680]   you know, for the kids, right?
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.520]   'Cause if you're more resourced, right?
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.460]   I always tell patients that, you know,
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.360]   when they come to see me for like erection problems
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.200]   or anything, I always say,
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.280]   nothing gets better with age, right?
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.920]   And that's mostly true, although they pointed out
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.440]   that salary often goes up with age
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.680]   and wisdom goes up with age.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.600]   So you would imagine if you're more resourced,
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.980]   maybe the kids are gonna also have an advantage to that.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.320]   But, you know, again, there's a lot of convincing data
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.180]   that that's probably not the case.
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.480]   There's even, there's one study that I saw
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:24.260]   that showed that if you look at MRIs of brains of children,
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.520]   just after birth, they're actually a little smaller
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.920]   for older fathers compared to younger fathers.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.080]   So I think there are some, you know,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.400]   sort of talking about kind of neurocognitive development,
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   some of those effects.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.920]   And there's also been studies looking at cancer risk too.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.680]   So higher risk of breast cancer, prostate cancer
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.640]   in adult children, higher risk of, you know,
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.000]   leukemia or CNS cancers in children as well.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.300]   So I think the more we look,
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.060]   the more we find out of these associations
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.400]   with paternal age.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.900]   So I think it's something to certainly be aware of.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.000]   I think you talking about mitigation strategies,
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.360]   I think sort of education would be important for,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.200]   you know, couples to try earlier,
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.500]   you know, individuals to try earlier to conceive.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.240]   You know, if we think it's a mutational reason,
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.740]   I think, you know, certainly freezing sperm,
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.620]   I think is a good option as well.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.800]   - My understanding is that analysis of DNA fragmentation
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   in sperm does not allow for selection of the best sperm
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.120]   on the basis of a DNA composition translated to English.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.360]   What I mean is in order to tell whether or not
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.880]   the DNA are mutated in a sperm,
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.000]   you have to kill the sperm basically.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   So, and since in a given pool of sperm, so to speak,
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.960]   there will be forward motile, non motile, twitchers,
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.400]   twitching in place, dead sperm,
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.320]   some percentage of dead sperm or a motile sperm
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.640]   is presumably normal, some small percentage, hopefully.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.080]   And that some might have some DNA fragmentation,
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:54.960]   some might not.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.160]   So is the way to address this averages?
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.320]   What I'm hearing here is that if you haven't already
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.020]   had kids or if you want more kids,
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.880]   that you might want to know about your sperm quality,
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.860]   I would say you do.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.000]   And that if you can afford it,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.760]   you might want to take a look at DNA fragmentation data.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.400]   But having done this, what one receives is a chart
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.320]   that goes from red, bad to green, good.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.720]   And then they put the arrow, hopefully in the green zone,
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.880]   and then you say, oh, good, I'm in the green zone,
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.200]   I don't have fragmented DNA in my sperm.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.680]   But really that's an averaging of all the sperm, right?
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.800]   It could be that as you age,
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.240]   that some percentage of those sperm have fragmented DNA.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.440]   And if one of those is the one that successfully
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:47.160]   wins the eggs, so to speak, fertilizes the egg,
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.080]   then that fragmented DNA containing sperm
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.400]   is going to propagate that into your offspring.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.000]   So are there any technologies that can allow men
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   to select for or improve the DNA of their sperm,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.520]   not just the motility?
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.480]   - I mean, yeah, I wish, right?
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.840]   That's sort of the holy grail,
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.440]   because I think you pointed out sort of a variant
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.000]   of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is that we can't,
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.840]   if we identify which sperm is bad,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.560]   we're necessarily going to destroy it.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.720]   So to tell which one is harboring these mutations
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.520]   would be great, but I think we're not there yet.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.640]   I mean, one thing that we do do is wash sperm.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.840]   So we do sort of select the most motile sperm.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.520]   We clear out the dead ones.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.320]   And I think embryologists are pretty good
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.880]   at telling which sperm they think are better.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.440]   But again, we don't have any real objective data
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.240]   to try and understand which are harboring
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.080]   something or other.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.040]   But I think if we understood more about this link with age
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.200]   or again, other conditions,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.200]   hopefully we would be able to stop some of this pass-through.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.500]   - Let's get back to the prostate, this incredible gland.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.700]   Tell us about the prostate.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.240]   I think we hear about the prostate,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.720]   we hear about prostate cancer.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.280]   People might've heard that it's involved
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.880]   in the ejaculatory response.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   It's involved in erections.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.480]   It's involved in a number of things.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.320]   If you could give us a catalog of things
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.880]   that the prostate does.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.240]   I mean, you spent a lot of time thinking about this gland.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.920]   What are some of the cooler things that it does
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.160]   that we don't know about?
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.680]   How do we keep it healthy?
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.600]   And what are the consequences of not keeping it healthy?
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.320]   - Yeah, so the prostate is a gland
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.560]   about the size of a walnut.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.000]   It sits behind the bladder
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.280]   and it's involved in reproduction.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.760]   It produces some of the proteins, enzymes
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.160]   that are necessary for sperm to be supported
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.320]   and ejaculate to kind of keep the sperm healthy
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.400]   in the female reproductive tract.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.640]   So it functions in reproduction
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.240]   and then basically after reproduction is done,
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.920]   it doesn't really serve any useful function.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.280]   So then it just becomes a problem essentially.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.440]   So the urethra, which is where we pee through,
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.880]   so it connects the bladder to exits the body,
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.160]   runs right through the prostate.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.040]   And as we age, the prostate does get bigger.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.160]   That's sort of a known thing.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.200]   And as the prostate gets bigger,
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.560]   it creates sort of more resistance in this pipe.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.320]   And so it makes the bladder have to work harder
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.560]   and that leads to a lot of the symptoms
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.040]   that we've been talking about already.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.520]   Waking up at night, weak stream,
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.480]   this need to urinate urgently,
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.080]   sometimes feeling like you're not emptying all the way.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.660]   So it's sort of a consequence
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.160]   of the prostate sort of being there.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.240]   In terms of ways that you can keep the prostate healthy,
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.940]   I think that there's really nothing
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.480]   that necessarily you can do.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.680]   I think that one thing I talk to patients about
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.240]   when these sort of symptoms start
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.020]   is to know some of the triggers.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.720]   So like you mentioned,
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.580]   drinking a lot before you go to bed.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.920]   So if you don't wanna wake up at night,
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.040]   that's not a good practice.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.960]   You may even wanna go into bed sort of a little dehydrated
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.360]   just so you can try and last the night.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.080]   There are some particular drinks or foods
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.360]   that tend to be more irritating.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.240]   So like spicy foods, acidic foods,
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.840]   those can sometimes irritate the lining of the bladder
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   and make you have to pee a little bit more.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.840]   Caffeine is a diuretic, so it makes us urinate more,
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.160]   and it can also irritate the bladder
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.080]   and give you that sensation.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.800]   Alcohol will do the same thing.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.160]   So I think kind of knowing some of those triggers
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.160]   may kind of stave off some of the symptoms a little bit.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:07.040]   But again, if you enjoy those vices
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:10.240]   and you're willing to tolerate it, that's okay too.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.100]   - I'm hearing more and more about a practice
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:16.720]   of people taking low dose to dalafil, Cialis.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.620]   Low dose, meaning in the neighborhood
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.020]   of 2.5 to five milligrams per day,
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.580]   not necessarily for erectile dysfunction,
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.060]   but for prostate health.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:29.120]   And was somewhat surprised to learn
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.180]   that those drugs were actually developed first
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.640]   for treatment of prostate health,
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.600]   to increase blood flow to the prostate.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.100]   Is that true?
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:43.100]   And is there a good reason to think about taking 2.5
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.280]   to five milligrams of to dalafil per day,
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:50.080]   simply for maintaining blood flow to the prostate
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.960]   and thereby maintaining or improving prostate health?
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.240]   - I mean, certainly it can do that.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.360]   It can definitely help with some of these urinary symptoms
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.720]   that we've been talking about.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.520]   You know, looking at placebo controlled trials,
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.280]   sort of our highest level of evidence does show that,
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.540]   you know, low dose of to dalafil is two and a half
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:05.380]   to five milligrams.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.880]   Daily dosing can help with these urinary symptoms.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.920]   So I think that not necessarily it's a preventative measure,
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.680]   but for men that are bothered, you know,
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.000]   otherwise I think most men probably wouldn't want
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.320]   to take a pill every day,
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.720]   but certainly if you have some of these symptoms,
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.460]   it can definitely help with urinary bother.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.300]   And then the added benefit is you also alluded to,
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.100]   is it can help with erectile function as well.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.980]   - Even at the 2.5 to five milligram dosage, interesting.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:31.500]   Yeah, my experience is that there are a lot of people
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.440]   who would love to take pills every day.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.220]   There seems to be a kind of binary distribution where,
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.920]   and here I'm just thinking about the males that I hear from,
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.960]   because I hear from of course, males and females,
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.140]   but I get a lot of questions about what can I take?
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:47.980]   What can I take?
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:48.800]   What can I take?
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.680]   But as you point out, there's also a category of men
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.880]   who seem to not want to take anything,
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.400]   not want to measure anything, not want to take anything,
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.780]   but especially not take anything.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:00.500]   And then there's the other group.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.720]   And the other group somewhat surprisingly
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.840]   seem to be the younger, excuse me, population
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.900]   who maybe grew up in the YouTube era
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.040]   or maybe in the era where sexual health
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.180]   was discussed more openly than it was
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.280]   certainly when I was in college.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.880]   I mean, the extent of sexual health discussions
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.100]   at my high school, and I went to a very good high school,
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.560]   where it only takes one sperm,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.160]   which as you pointed out is true for IVF,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.600]   but more is better if you're trying to conceive naturally.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.120]   And there were discussions about communication and consent,
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.700]   obviously super important.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.960]   And then they just kind of turned us loose
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.640]   to learn from our friends and other sources.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   I mean, and family sometimes had the discussion,
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.540]   sometimes didn't.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:45.640]   Different families, different discussions, obviously.
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.200]   So very little information.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.880]   Nowadays, I think there's a lot more discussion
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.920]   about these things.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:55.120]   And so the 20 to 40 year old male crowd
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.920]   seems to be the crowd that are asking,
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.160]   yeah, what can I take?
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.800]   These are also the people who are getting on
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.400]   testosterone therapy early, perhaps without the need.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.680]   I just want to flag that because I think,
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.320]   if I understand correctly,
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.320]   you're seeing a lot of testosterone therapy
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.960]   that perhaps people don't need.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.920]   Is that right?
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.840]   - Well, I think it's a mix.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.000]   Some people probably do need it,
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.320]   but I think that before starting it,
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.800]   everybody should be aware of all the risks
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.720]   and you've kind of highlighted some.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.120]   Testosterone, any medication is going to have some risks.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.760]   And so everybody needs to be aware of what those are.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.480]   And for testosterone, reproduction is certainly one of them.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.400]   - And if they're not already doing all the other things,
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.320]   getting adequate sleep, limiting their alcohol intake,
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.040]   not smoking, getting exercise, et cetera,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.700]   seems that testosterone therapy
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.880]   would not be the primary entry point.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.700]   Like first work out all the basics.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.840]   I think that's the big difference.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.800]   I think nowadays the what should I take question
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.380]   comes up early when people aren't necessarily doing
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:53.640]   all the other things that they could do
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.680]   to promote their health.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:57.200]   Anyway, this is observational on my part.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.560]   You're the one who's clinic they're showing up to.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.240]   I have a question about UTIs.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.320]   We hear about UTIs, urinary tract infections
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.640]   in women pretty often.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:13.000]   Do men get UTIs?
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.800]   If they're getting more than one UTI per year,
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.780]   is that abnormal?
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:22.780]   Should men be examined for this bladder,
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.460]   urethra, prostate, penile architecture?
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:28.080]   I know there are ways that people can come in.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.160]   I was reading about this prior to this episode
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:33.680]   that can ingest a dye and then they can dye image
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.520]   the whole apparatus, is that right?
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.040]   - That's true. - Without having to cut
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.600]   anything, is that right?
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.160]   Is that worth people doing or is that only under conditions
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.860]   where people are experiencing some vexing issue?
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.760]   - Yeah, I think that some of those tests
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.980]   should only be done if there's a problem.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:52.360]   But I think a male urinary tract infection is rare enough
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.760]   that it should be evaluated.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.920]   So women have very short urethras,
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.500]   but men have a very long urethra, right?
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.560]   It has to go through the entire penile urethra,
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.320]   the prostatic urethra up into the bladder.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.280]   And so the way a urinary tract infection would happen,
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.500]   one way would be that a bacteria actually gets
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.520]   all the way back and that's just a much longer trek.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.360]   And so if something rare like that does happen,
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.080]   we look for anatomic causes for that.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.560]   So there can be different scar tissue in the urethra,
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.800]   for example, there can be stones in the bladder,
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.600]   there can be stones in the kidney.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.680]   Sometimes men aren't emptying their bladders all the way.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.400]   So those men should be evaluated
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.860]   because there can be some pathology
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.600]   that we could hopefully identify and correct.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.300]   - Let's talk about erectile dysfunction.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.360]   I put out the call for questions
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.260]   in anticipation of this episode.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:42.260]   And no surprise, at least 30% of the questions
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.940]   from males were about erectile dysfunction.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:52.020]   Or questions about what's normal in terms of libido level.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.920]   Kind of interesting, right?
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.140]   And we'll deal with the first question first,
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.840]   but what are the most common causes of erectile dysfunction?
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.560]   Are they hormonal in nature?
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.500]   I think that's a common belief
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.560]   that if people are experiencing erectile dysfunction,
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.920]   that it's because their testosterone levels are too low.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.280]   Hence all the interest in testosterone therapy.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.640]   Or are there other, say blood flow related,
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.640]   pelvic flow related, neural brain to body neural connections
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.180]   that are responsible, I'm guessing it's all of these things.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:29.180]   How do we parse this and tell us about erectile dysfunction,
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.660]   what you most commonly see,
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:34.320]   what you most commonly do in order to treat it.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.040]   - Yeah, so erectile dysfunction, as you know,
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.960]   is sort of the inability to consistently achieve
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.280]   and maintain an erection.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.880]   And it's fairly common, of all the conditions I see,
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.640]   that's definitely the number one.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.840]   So if you look at men who are experiencing erectile dysfunction
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.520]   so, you know, if you look at men over the age of 40,
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:55.160]   over half will have some trouble with erections.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.800]   Under age of 40, it's probably about 15 to 20%.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.540]   So this is a very common condition that we see.
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.800]   In terms of the etiology, it can vary a little bit.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.640]   You know, we used to think
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.280]   that they were primarily psychogenic,
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.200]   but that was, you know, years, that was decades ago.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.920]   Now we know that most of them are organic,
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.760]   so it's actually a blood flow issue.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.680]   So the most common conditions, just sort of nationally,
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.160]   would be the same things that cause blood flow problems
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:18.980]   anywhere in the body.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.120]   Like blood pressure, diabetes, you know, atherosclerosis,
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.280]   anything that sort of can impair blood getting,
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.760]   you know, to the end organ.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.100]   And sometimes, you know, there has been data that,
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.980]   you know, trouble with erections can actually predate
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.120]   other more, you know, serious, you know, vascular conditions.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.540]   So the blood vessels in the penis,
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.160]   the penile arteries are about one millimeter, you know,
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.480]   and the heart and the brain, they're much larger.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.400]   So, you know, it's much easier to occlude a small vessel
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.240]   than a large vessel.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.700]   So that's why there have been some studies to support
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:51.240]   that it's sort of an early marker for vascular disease.
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.280]   So I think looking at those risk factors, you know,
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.640]   sort of lifestyle, obesity, again, is another,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.420]   is a common one.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.440]   Endocrine disorder is actually fairly small.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.500]   It's probably less than 10%, probably around 5% or so.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:07.240]   Pelvic cancer treatment is another very common one
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.440]   after, you know, treatment for prostate cancer,
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.560]   whether it be radiotherapy or surgical therapy,
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.580]   bladder cancer, sometimes rectal, colorectal cancer,
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.420]   that treatment also.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.720]   Anytime we're, you know, involving some of the nerves
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.520]   and the vasculature and the pelvis,
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.880]   that can also impact erectile function as well.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.680]   - What about hernia?
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.420]   - Hernia, that should be separate.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.020]   So sometimes if they're, you know,
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:34.260]   I always say that in medicine, you can never say never.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.560]   But, you know, generally if that was gonna manifest
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.760]   as erectile function, it would probably be due to
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.680]   maybe some pain syndromes can rarely happen
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.360]   during just the early post-operative period.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.100]   But the blood supply, the nervous supply is separate.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.740]   - So you said something very important for people to hear,
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.080]   so I'm gonna highlight it.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.780]   You said that less than 10% of erectile dysfunction
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:57.780]   is due to a hormonal issue.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.720]   I don't know how much time you're spending
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.160]   on YouTube and the internet,
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.900]   but that is going to be a shocker for a lot of males
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.140]   out there because so much of the discussion
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.880]   around testosterone is around libido and sexual function.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:15.840]   So it's key for people to hear that.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.440]   It's also key for them to know about this other 90%.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.120]   When you say blood flow issue,
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:27.000]   then what is the common first pass for treatment?
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.960]   And again, and forgive me for listing this off
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.860]   over and over, but we are assuming here
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.240]   that people have gotten their body weight down,
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.140]   they're sleeping enough,
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.040]   they're not ingesting excessive alcohol,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.760]   they're not smoking or vaping,
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.440]   they're not smoking cannabis or doing the edibles,
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.740]   although maybe we should talk about edibles
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.160]   and cannabis and endocrine effects, we'll do that later.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.720]   - Doing all the things right,
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.040]   avoiding doing the wrong things too often
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.380]   or at least completely.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:54.820]   So we're assuming they're doing all that correctly.
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:57.360]   Their testosterone levels are somewhere in that 300
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:00.400]   to 900 nanogram per deciliter range.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.840]   That's typical for the so-called reference range
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.220]   in at least in the US, I think it goes up to 1200
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.840]   or maybe 1400 in other countries,
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.860]   but as other countries like to point out,
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:15.120]   but it starts at two, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.420]   But assuming they're doing everything correctly
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:20.200]   and it's not a testosterone issue,
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.320]   then if it's a blood flow issue,
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.080]   meaning they haven't had treatment for some pelvic cancer,
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.800]   what is the first line of treatment?
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.760]   - Yeah, so assuming that lifestyle
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.880]   and all that has been optimized,
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.740]   medical treatment has been optimized,
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:36.780]   there's a lot that we can do.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   I always tell men, as long as you have a penis,
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.680]   we can always make it hard.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.080]   So there's a tremendous amount.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.240]   - I'm sure that you're the most popular doctor
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.080]   in your field as a consequence.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.620]   - Yeah, that usually does kind of ease everybody.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.160]   So usually we start with oral therapy.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.660]   So phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy.
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.600]   So that would be like sildenafil or Viagra,
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.600]   Tidalafil, Cialis, Avanafil, Stendra or Vardenafil, Levitra.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.580]   - Would you be willing to talk
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.680]   about some of the specifics there?
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.200]   Are you, is the typical thing to put people
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.760]   on this 2.5 to five milligrams per day low dose
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.460]   or to give the higher doses that are more commonly used
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.220]   for erectile dysfunction per se?
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.500]   - I think it depends, you know,
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:15.600]   why we're putting them on it
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.480]   and how much sex they have too.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.180]   You know, on average, people probably have sex,
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:22.740]   you know, partnered sex maybe once a week on average.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.380]   You know, when we're looking at men
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.680]   in their kind of thirties and beyond, you know,
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.660]   sometimes it can be a few more times a week than that.
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.760]   But you know, if they're having sex every day
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.160]   or very often, then sometimes a daily dose can be useful.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.040]   But generally, most men are on just on demand
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.140]   'cause they're gonna fall into that, you know,
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.040]   maybe about, you know, a few times a month category.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.720]   So that's usually where we start.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.840]   And you know, there are sort of a titration
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.680]   that can be done.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.820]   You can go slightly, you know, higher doses or lower doses.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.460]   So usually we start in the middle to the higher doses.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:53.820]   And you know, we talk about some of the side effects
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:57.040]   they may have, but those probably help 60 to 70% of men
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.120]   and they work well.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.640]   You know, in terms of another common question
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.880]   is how do we decide which one we're gonna start?
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.800]   Sometimes insurance will tell us which one we're gonna do.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.040]   That's a common one.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.960]   You know, all these medications tend to be somewhat similar.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.480]   One difference tends to be the time of onset.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.760]   You know, how quickly they reach peak levels in the body
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.560]   and then also how quickly they're cleared from the body.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.520]   So Tidalafil is somewhat different and then it lasts longer.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.420]   The half-life is about 20 hours or so.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.340]   So it's sort of marketed as a weekend pill.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.020]   So some people like the idea of that, you know,
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:28.480]   taking a pill on Friday,
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.240]   still having some left on Saturday.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.680]   But for others, you know, we start with one of the other ones.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.440]   - The fact that these drugs like Tidalafil,
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.620]   also called Cialis, right?
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:40.460]   - Cialis, yeah.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:41.280]   - Is Cialis the brand name?
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.120]   - Right.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:44.400]   - And Viagra, is that a brand name?
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.240]   - Right.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.060]   - Stands for, what is the generic name?
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:48.900]   - Sildenafil.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:49.740]   - Sildenafil, okay.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:52.260]   So because they are effective
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.240]   in such a large percentage of cases,
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.520]   what does that say about the vascular system
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:00.980]   of all these males that are having erectile dysfunction,
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.080]   but then it's getting resolved by these drug treatments?
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.120]   Is that, in other words, somebody comes into your clinic,
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.060]   they're having this issue, you prescribe one of these drugs,
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.680]   they come back and say, "Everything's working great,"
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.400]   or maybe they don't come back, they just, you know,
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.280]   send an email and say, "Everything's great."
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.660]   But do you need to have a discussion with that person
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.760]   about their overall vascular health?
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.900]   Because a few minutes ago, you told us that
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.480]   the fact that they weren't getting erections
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.720]   due to what now appears to be a vascular issue
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.360]   can be resolved for the penile tissue,
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.200]   but is it going to solve their other vascular issues
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.920]   or should those people be on the lookout
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.620]   for cerebrovascular, cardiovascular disease
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.380]   that can potentially cause things at least as bad
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.360]   as erectile dysfunction or maybe worse?
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.200]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.260]   Well, I think they should be screened.
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:50.360]   So, you know, sometimes I'm diagnosing in the first doctor
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.480]   that they're seeing in a long, long time,
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.860]   but otherwise I do encourage them
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.600]   to see a primary care doctor to be screened
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.000]   for blood pressure, lipid levels, fasting, blood glucose,
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]   all those things, again, sort of for early markers
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:02.820]   or some of these.
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.480]   Sometimes they're identified, sometimes not,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.080]   but I think it's, you know, I think we kind of talked about
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.040]   sort of the ideal patient that's perfect body weight,
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:09.960]   nothing else is going on,
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:12.400]   but that's, as you know, a very rare entity.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.980]   So usually there's something that can be done
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:14.880]   to be optimized.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.240]   And I don't, I try not to be alarmist about this,
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.480]   but I do want to, you know,
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.540]   encourage men to sort of take ownership of the health
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.360]   'cause that sometimes can improve, you know,
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.300]   some of these conditions.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.940]   But again, we have terrific medications
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:28.160]   for men in whom we cannot.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.080]   - What are the common side effects of these drugs?
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.440]   - So they're vasodilators, they open up blood vessels,
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.020]   so we get some off-target effects.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.880]   So headache, facial flushing, backaches,
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.520]   leg cramps, indigestion, nasal congestion,
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.520]   those would be the most common.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.760]   - Before the last Super Bowl,
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.200]   there was some press about the fact
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:47.400]   that a lot of the players were taking these drugs
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.320]   at low dosages before the game,
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.400]   presumably to increase blood flow to their muscles
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.680]   and brain, is that what the rationale was?
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.520]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.960]   You know, another is we talked about sort of how
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.960]   cycling may lead to erectile problems or sexual problems.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.640]   There has been some data looking at taking like Viagra
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.720]   or one of these medications, Cialis, Todalafil,
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.360]   before a ride, again, to try and increase circulation
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.840]   to decrease the chance of any of the negative effects
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.080]   of prolonged saddle pressure.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.160]   - So it sounds like just increasing blood flow
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.680]   and lowering blood pressure slightly
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.640]   is just a good thing all around.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.840]   - Yeah, I think there's certainly a benefit.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.620]   Yeah, 'cause these medications were originally,
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.640]   I think, as you're alluding to,
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.840]   were developed as a blood pressure treatment.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.560]   And this was sort of an amazing off-target effect
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.840]   that has turned into a billion dollar industry.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.440]   - So you mentioned about 10% or less
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.080]   of erectile dysfunction is due to endocrine issues.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.480]   Was it 60 to 70% can be resolved
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.760]   with these blood flow enhancers?
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.640]   I know that's a terribly nonclinical,
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.160]   non-scientific way to describe it,
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.260]   Viagra, Cialis, Todalafil, et cetera.
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:55.440]   What about the remaining percentage
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.600]   and are there other treatments that you prescribed
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.600]   or given, in which cases do you need to resort to,
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.800]   I guess, more invasive approaches?
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.980]   - Yeah, so another therapy we have
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:10.180]   is urethral suppository.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.600]   So you can actually put a medication
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.440]   in the tip of the penis
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.560]   and send absorbed by the rest of the penis.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.340]   - Also inject, it's suppository.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:19.480]   - It's suppository or a gel, or a jelly, yeah.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.900]   So it's also a vasodilator.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.840]   Sort of the concept is very similar.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.560]   Sometimes that is okay for men and they tolerate it.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.400]   It's safe for partners as well.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:31.600]   It can tingle a little bit.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.040]   So we definitely let men know
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.240]   'cause one of the main medications
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.840]   does cause like a little bit of a burn as well.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.800]   - Why would somebody do this
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.680]   as opposed to taking the pill form
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.080]   of the drugs we were just talking about?
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.200]   - Mostly efficacy would be a big one.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.980]   And so this can sometimes help where others cannot.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:50.600]   So that's one.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.400]   Penile injections are another common therapy.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.200]   So the efficacy of penile injections
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.260]   are probably 80 to 90%.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.980]   Again, we're injecting vasodilators into the penis.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.320]   So the idea is just opens up blood vessels,
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.240]   easier to get and to keep erections.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.100]   You can imagine there's a huge psychological barrier
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.500]   to putting a needle in your penis.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.640]   - Is this something that the patients
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.880]   are doing for themselves at home
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.940]   or that you're doing, is it long lasting?
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.620]   Is that something you do at the clinic
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.960]   and then they come back every few weeks or so?
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.720]   - No, yeah, this is an on-demand treatment.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.960]   So we teach them how to do it
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.880]   the first time they do it with us in clinic.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.680]   Ideally, we try and get an erection
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.000]   that lasts probably 20 or 30 minutes.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.840]   So we usually start at a low dose
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.140]   and then they just increase at home
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:31.240]   until they get an erection that lasts
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.240]   for that amount of time.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.960]   - Is it injected subcutaneous
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.520]   or actually into the, goodness,
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.520]   the meteor tissue of the penis?
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.620]   - That's right, yeah, into the erectile bodies directly.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.840]   Yeah, and you only have to inject one side.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.640]   They do communicate with each other.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.460]   Most men say it's fine.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.040]   It's a small, it's a very small gauge needle,
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.040]   about as big as a few strands of hair.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.640]   - I'm an appointment over in ophthalmology
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.940]   and I've seen injections into the human eyeball
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:58.380]   and it is incredible how fast
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.080]   and how painless that procedure is
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.440]   when it's done by the right person.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.300]   Nobody should try that at home on their own,
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.700]   but when it's done by a skilled ophthalmologist,
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:06.540]   it's just striking.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.600]   You hear, you think about needle in the eye,
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.520]   what's worse?
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.760]   It's like the childhood rhyme, right?
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.600]   Stick a needle in my eye.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.840]   So you can't think of anything worse,
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:17.420]   but maybe an injection in the penis sounds almost as bad,
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.980]   but you're telling me that if patients are prescribed this,
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.880]   that they can do this with limited, if any, discomfort.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.680]   - Well, it does have a high dropout rate.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.400]   - Surprise, surprise.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.920]   - Yeah, I think no one's excited about it.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.960]   It's, I guess the mood can sometimes be affected,
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.580]   but a lot of couples are very comfortable with it.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.660]   Again, it's very efficacious.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.080]   The man can do it, his partner can do it.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.020]   So it does work well.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:43.500]   - And I guess here we're sort of ascending
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.920]   the list of invasiveness.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.760]   What is at the sort of top tier of invasiveness
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.540]   for erectile dysfunction?
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:54.780]   - So then we go into penile implants.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.700]   So there's actually a surgical procedure we can do
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.080]   to put a device inside the penis
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.700]   that can help men be hard when they want to.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.520]   And that comes in sort of two main forms.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.780]   There's either non-inflatable or inflatable.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.240]   So the non-inflatable is sort of a bendable.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.460]   It has sort of a metal core.
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:13.220]   And so when men don't wanna have sex, they bend it down.
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.620]   When they're ready for sex, they can kind of bend it up.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:17.280]   - It's really just they're on demand.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.980]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:19.960]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.720]   So it's very simple to use.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.260]   Sort of the more, I guess,
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:26.620]   kind of sort of natural form would be the inflatable.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.520]   So when you're not using it, it's deflated.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.120]   And then when you're ready to use it, it's inflated.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.700]   And you inflate it with basically a pump
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.640]   that's in the scrotum.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.500]   So all this is sort of surgically implanted inside a man
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.100]   all under the skin.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.500]   Unless you know what you're looking for,
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.680]   it'd be very difficult to tell
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.360]   if a man has it or doesn't have it.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.980]   But when he's ready, he pumps it up
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:46.980]   and it moves fluid from a reservoir,
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.860]   which usually is also surgically implanted
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.800]   into the penis to get a rigid erection.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.900]   - What is the relationship
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:57.180]   between psychological arousal and erection
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.820]   as it relates to these technologies?
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:48:59.860]   I mean, the way you're describing it
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:02.780]   sounds purely mechanical, right?
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.380]   We're talking about nocturnal erections,
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:06.980]   which I suppose people could be having erotic dreams,
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.540]   but I don't think that's a prerequisite
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.820]   for nocturnal erections at all, right?
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:16.820]   So is the idea that if adequate blood flow is achieved,
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:21.160]   then any signal from the brain can initiate a cascade
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.860]   of blood flow that creates the erection?
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:26.220]   Or is it the case with some of these treatments
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:31.220]   that it sounds like blood flow is almost autonomous?
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.340]   - Right, well, I think a lot of these,
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.700]   yeah, the blood flow is not adequate
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:37.040]   and that's why we're having to sort of go beyond.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.220]   But generally, as you point out,
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.340]   there's different stimulation,
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:43.100]   whether it be visual, tactile, or factory,
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:46.060]   that sort of starts that cascade
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:47.920]   that releases neurotransmitters in the penis
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.700]   that leads to this vasodilation naturally,
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:52.220]   and men get erections.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:57.220]   - Few years ago, I was reading about vasopressin inhalants.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.660]   There was a bunch of stuff hitting the market.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:01.880]   By the way, I don't suggest that people
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.020]   get experimental with this stuff.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:06.500]   As a neuroscientist who also knows the thing
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.560]   about neuropeptides and neurohormones
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.740]   that can impact the hypothalamus,
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:13.900]   I just cover my eyes and kind of cringe
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:16.380]   when I think about people inhaling vasopressin thinking,
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:18.860]   oh yeah, there's a study that vasopressin
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.260]   increases sexual desire or something like that.
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:24.500]   But nowadays, I'm reading a lot more
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:27.700]   about a really interesting peptide treatment,
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:30.180]   which I think is a FDA-approved prescription drug,
[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:35.180]   which relates to a melanocyte-stimulating hormone
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:37.500]   that comes out of the medial pituitary
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.980]   that is used to increase sexual desire.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:42.480]   It's prescribed for women.
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.480]   But men are starting to take it.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.980]   And it seems to have,
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:50.140]   at least from what you read on the internet,
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.060]   a pretty profound impact on libido
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.860]   and on erectile frequency and persistence.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:00.260]   Is this something that you're using in your clinic?
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.620]   Yeah, what about these peptides
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.340]   that people are inhaling and injecting?
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:07.220]   And some of them are taken in oral form,
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:09.460]   but most often I think it's nasal inhalant
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:16.260]   or it's a subcutaneous injection.
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:19.220]   Yeah, so those are not ones that we use in clinic.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.260]   But I think looking at sort of
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.020]   just sexual dysfunction broadly,
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.540]   there are a lot of things that we do try and help.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:29.740]   And one of the things that kind of relates to that,
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.900]   that it's been a proposed treatment for it,
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:35.720]   is this concept of delayed orgasm or delayed ejaculation.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:36.980]   So I think everybody's familiar
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:38.400]   with premature ejaculation, right,
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.460]   where men ejaculate too quickly.
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.660]   But on the other end of the spectrum,
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:45.700]   there's men that takes a long time to ejaculate.
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.980]   And what that is is sort of defined differently,
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:50.240]   but generally most people would say
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:52.500]   like sort of two standard deviations above average.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:55.060]   So on average, probably around five minutes or so,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.660]   two standard deviations would be kind of 20 to 25 minutes.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:00.060]   So for men that take that long to ejaculate,
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:01.260]   that would be considered delayed.
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.700]   Or sometimes they don't ejaculate
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:05.300]   every time that they have relations.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:07.740]   So for those, I think there is a need for treatment
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:10.100]   because there's no FDA approved therapy for that.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.940]   And so that's why I think providers are trying
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:15.380]   some of these other more experimental things.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:19.020]   There's some that we use, just not that one in particular.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.260]   There's also some devices that have been trialed as well,
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.980]   but it's a challenge because I certainly
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.820]   really feel for these men.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:27.580]   It's one of the pleasures in life.
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:29.380]   And some of them are never able to have sex
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.580]   or only, or sorry, never able to orgasm,
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.060]   and some are only able to do it very rarely.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.660]   So we do want to offer them benefit.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:40.100]   What about pelvic floor health more generally?
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:42.420]   The topic of pelvic floor health is something
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:46.420]   that comes up more often around female reproductive health
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.300]   and urology.
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:52.860]   You hear about Kegels, Kegels, Kegels, I don't know.
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.540]   I guess we'll have to ask him because it turns out Kegel,
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:59.820]   Kegel was a person who named the exercise after himself.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:03.000]   Whether or not he did them or not, I do not know.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.260]   But my understanding is that Kegels
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.900]   are a pelvic floor strengthening exercise.
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:13.060]   And my understanding is that some people
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:16.760]   experience urinary or sexual dysfunction
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:21.760]   because of a overly relaxed, aka weak pelvic floor,
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.980]   but that some people have the exact same problems
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:28.860]   because of a hyper contracted, aka overly tense,
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:31.380]   tight, strong pelvic floor.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:33.560]   Meaning don't run out and start doing Kegels
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.700]   just 'cause you heard about them.
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   They're not good for everybody.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.940]   They might be bad for certain people.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.620]   But what about pelvic floor health?
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.900]   I mean, should men be paying attention
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:41.740]   to pelvic floor health?
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.260]   Should men be doing pelvic floor exercises?
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:45.900]   - I mean, I think it's really key that you say that
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.900]   'cause not everything you hear about is good.
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:49.740]   And I think it's not good for the right person.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.660]   So there are certainly men that I see that have very,
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:54.640]   just a lot of tension, a lot of anxiety.
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.020]   Sometimes these men urinate every hour.
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:58.640]   I mean, there's other things that you could just tell.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:00.620]   They're just sort of very wound up.
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:03.620]   And I think for that man, one of the issues
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.660]   you kind of allude to is he probably needs to relax more.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:08.860]   So pelvic floor physical therapy can still benefit you
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:10.900]   'cause there are some just different feedback exercises
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:12.440]   that could be done to help with relaxation.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.900]   So in the urologist office,
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.740]   there's usually a list of a lot of different providers
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:19.300]   around the region that can help with some of these.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.980]   Kegel exercises though can be useful, for example,
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.860]   for prostate cancer rehabilitation.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.500]   Some of these men where we're trying to kind of rebuild
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:30.280]   some of the strength or maintain or improve continents
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.120]   in these men.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.020]   We do wanna strengthen some of these muscles
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.700]   just so that they can sort of recreate or replace
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.540]   what was lost when the prostate was removed.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:39.900]   So I think for the right man, they can be useful,
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:43.460]   but yeah, it could be a dangerous tool in the wrong hands.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.260]   - And you mentioned that if people want to learn more
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.460]   about pelvic floor therapy,
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:51.100]   they can contact their local urologist
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:53.380]   and find a good pelvic floor,
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:55.220]   good male pelvic floor specialist.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.500]   Do they tend to specialize male, female?
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:00.780]   - They're usually pretty much gender or sex agnostic.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:03.720]   So they usually are able to help all.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:06.420]   - And forgive me for asking
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.520]   for an abridged anatomy lesson here,
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:12.080]   but could you describe the pelvic floor muscles
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.020]   and how they relate to the bladder prostate,
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:18.300]   urethra penis anatomy that you talked about before?
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.820]   'Cause I have the picture
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.640]   of the bladder urethra prostate penis in my brain.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.540]   I know my life experience where the testes in scrotum
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:30.500]   are relative to all of that,
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:33.040]   but now I'm trying to figure out how like,
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.880]   so the pelvic floor,
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.500]   a bunch of muscles that are attached to the pelvis,
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:40.460]   but how do they interact with those organs?
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:41.420]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:44.460]   So they sit beneath the sort of in the perineum.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.880]   So the area between the scrotum and the anus
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.980]   and back beyond too.
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:50.260]   So they basically support all the structures there.
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:53.820]   They support the base of the penis, the prostates,
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.980]   the bladder, the rectum,
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:59.640]   and they kind of keep main adequate tension
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.960]   to keep all those structures up.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.060]   They relax when different functions are necessary.
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.820]   They're very important for ejaculation.
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:08.280]   Some people think that they kind of trigger
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.380]   some of the orgasmic response as well.
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:14.520]   Sometimes men will have pain in that area,
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:17.500]   in the perineal area can transmit to other parts of the body
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:18.860]   like the scrotum.
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:21.960]   One cause of scrotal pain and there can be many
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.700]   can sometimes be pelvic floor dysfunction.
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:27.780]   So I think, again, pelvic floor therapy can be useful
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.000]   for sort of a constellation of symptoms
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.080]   against some urinary symptoms as well.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:34.540]   So I think for some patients it can be helpful,
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:39.020]   but again, if you get things too tense,
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:40.440]   that can sometimes be harmful.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.580]   - So presumably these pelvic floor therapists
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:45.260]   also help people achieve a more relaxed pelvic floor
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:46.200]   if that's what they need.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.040]   - Exactly.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.880]   - Got it.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.040]   Going to some of the questions that came back to me
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.340]   when I solicited for questions
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:54.940]   in anticipation of this episode.
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:57.880]   Several, not a few.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.260]   Let's say a couple of dozen people asked
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:03.140]   about split urine stream.
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.900]   Is that a signature of prostate overgrowth?
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:09.100]   Is that a urethral issue?
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.420]   Is it perfectly normal?
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:15.300]   I'm assuming here they mean a split stream of urine
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.660]   that doesn't unify at any point.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:20.940]   They're talking about a consistently split urine stream.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.300]   And for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about,
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:23.740]   we're talking about a urine stream
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:25.060]   that's actually two urine streams.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.740]   And we're assuming one urethral opening
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.300]   'cause I hit the literature on this.
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.460]   And there is a case of a failure
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.220]   to fully fuse the urethral duct during development
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:38.720]   where some, I'm assuming small fraction of males
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.720]   have a urethral opening on the base of the penis
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.380]   and at the tip of the penis.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:45.120]   Let's rule that out as a possibility for now.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.820]   But now that it's on the table,
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:51.780]   what percentage of males have that two urethral openings?
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:54.060]   - So well, hypospatias, which you're describing
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:57.260]   where the actual meatus is not at the tip,
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:00.500]   but it's kind of along the proximal urethra
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.500]   or even further down sometimes in the scrotum,
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.000]   probably about 1% of births.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.560]   And usually it's recognized at birth
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.300]   and oftentimes it's surgically corrected
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:11.740]   'cause it's better to prepare it early rather than later.
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.720]   - Okay, so ruling that out,
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.900]   what is the cause of split urine stream
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:20.460]   and is it a signature of a larger issue?
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.220]   - One of the reasons that we urinate
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:25.180]   sort of from an evolutionary standpoint, right,
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:30.180]   is to basically deposit in sort of a convenient time
[01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:32.420]   our waste and we don't want to get it everywhere
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:35.960]   'cause we don't want to sort of label ourselves
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:37.620]   with the smell of urine 'cause that'll be easier
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:39.400]   for predators to be able to identify.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:40.620]   So just similar to today,
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.140]   we'd like everything to get in the toilet
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:43.060]   without creating a mess.
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:45.980]   So anytime there's turbulent flow,
[01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:48.140]   it certainly could signal an issue.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:49.700]   So it could be like urethral issues
[01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:53.580]   or pointing out a prostatic issue, inadequate speed
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:56.220]   of getting the urine out of the anus.
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:59.500]   So you definitely should see a physician to get evaluated
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:02.340]   because there's likely some issue that can be improved.
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:08.420]   - The most popular question I received from males, however,
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:12.780]   was about, perhaps no surprise, penis length.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.560]   You're an expert in this, actually.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.640]   Not just because you're a urologist,
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.280]   male reproductive health expert,
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.620]   but you published a study recently
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:29.140]   on the changing trends in penile length.
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.980]   Tell us about that study.
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:35.380]   I have so many questions about the methodology
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.940]   because I have to assume
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:39.040]   this didn't involve self-report, right?
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.140]   - Those were excluded, yeah.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:43.160]   - Yeah, so lying was excluded.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:48.240]   Being facetious here, but yeah, how was this study done?
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:53.240]   I mean, pretty incredible study and the results are,
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.860]   I don't know if they're surprising or not.
[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:57.300]   At first I thought, oh, this is surprising,
[01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:59.040]   but the results were only surprising
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.500]   in light of what you were talking about earlier
[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.300]   about sperm and testosterone levels.
[02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:05.660]   I think I'll let you describe the study now
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:07.800]   rather than giving people the punchline here.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.780]   - Yeah, so I mean, the origin was that we were looking at,
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.100]   we wanted to know average lengths
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.720]   for another project that we were doing.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.940]   And going down the rabbit hole,
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:18.180]   this has been reported for decades.
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:19.100]   There's different reasons
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:21.420]   that people have reported penile length.
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:23.860]   Sometimes they do it just on volunteers,
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:25.620]   again, to sort of get the average lengths
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:27.100]   of different populations.
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.120]   Sometimes it's done pre and pro-surgically
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.480]   to try and understand what changes would occur.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.160]   So we just sort of culled the literature,
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.320]   found data on 55,000 men all over the world
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.700]   and wanted to see if there was
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:41.520]   sort of a time pattern with that.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.920]   And similar to your hypothesis,
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.660]   we assumed based on all the other data
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:46.760]   that we would likely see a decline,
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.200]   whether it be chemical environmental exposure.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:51.880]   But if nothing else, if we're getting bigger,
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.920]   the functional penile length should decline
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.680]   because the suprapubic fat pad will get a little bit bigger.
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.800]   And so we'll kind of lose penile length with that.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.180]   And so much to our surprise-
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:03.320]   - The suprapubic fat, excuse me,
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:05.600]   being the pad of fat directly over the penis.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.760]   - Right, right.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.680]   And so if that gets bigger,
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.960]   that'll necessarily compromise penile length.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.560]   But as you alluded to,
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:13.780]   what we found is actually the opposite,
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:17.360]   that the penises were getting longer with time.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.000]   So how it's measured, it measured differently.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.180]   So one of our inclusion criteria
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:23.540]   was that all the studies have measured
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:26.220]   sort of in an office, sort of in a clinical setting.
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.420]   So whether it be a clinician
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:30.440]   or whether it be a researcher that actually did it.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.160]   So there's different ways you can measure a penis.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.900]   You could just do a stretch length.
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:35.780]   So you kind of stretch it up as much as you can
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.380]   and then use sort of a ruler to measure how long it is.
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.780]   Again, from as deep as you can get,
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:44.640]   the pubic bone ideally up to the tip of the glands.
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:46.160]   - Okay, guys, so here's what he's describing.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.080]   He's talking about measuring from the top,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.700]   not from the bottom.
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:52.640]   Believe it or not, people ask questions about this.
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.140]   - My daughter made that joke, actually.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:54.980]   - Oh, yeah?
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:56.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.900]   Measuring from the top, not from the bottom, no cheating.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:00.140]   You're talking about stretching the penis
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:01.980]   while it's flaccid, presumably,
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:05.000]   and then measuring from essentially contact
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.860]   with a location that's contact with the pubic bone
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:09.360]   to the tip.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.660]   - Right. - Okay.
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:15.640]   So that length was recorded in 50,000 men?
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:16.480]   Wow.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.720]   - Yeah, so that was one.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.120]   And then we also looked at erect length.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:20.840]   And so there's different ways that an erection
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.860]   can be achieved sort of in a clinical setting.
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:25.500]   So one is you could ask a man to stimulate himself
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:26.340]   and then measure.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:27.340]   So that was some of the studies.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:29.580]   And then the other method, as we alluded to earlier,
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:31.060]   is you could inject the man with the medicine
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.600]   to give him an erection and then measure it.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.620]   - And did 50,000 men participate in that aspect of the study?
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:38.460]   - It was less.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:42.700]   Yeah, I think that was about probably 10 to 15,000 men.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.980]   - I have to wonder whether or not it's easy or difficult
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:47.940]   for people to recruit subjects for these studies.
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:48.780]   I don't know.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:50.020]   I could see it going both ways.
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.400]   - Yeah, some of the studies actually had a tremendous number,
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:55.340]   had about like 15,000 men.
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:57.020]   Some individual studies contributed to that.
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:58.680]   And actually, interesting, after we published it,
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.700]   there were some men that volunteered
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.700]   for the next study to be measured.
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:04.100]   - I'm sure you'll hear from some of them
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:05.160]   after this episode.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.560]   What was the major finding?
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:09.800]   - So the major finding we wanted to do
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.040]   is just give normative data.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:12.560]   We found that it varied around the world,
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:14.840]   so based on different regions,
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.840]   the average lengths varied a little bit.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.800]   But generally, on average, a wrecked penis
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.920]   is probably between about five to six inches
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:24.000]   somewhere in that neighborhood.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:24.840]   So that was kind of the take-home we wanted.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:26.000]   - That was the average.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.160]   - The average for a wrecked length.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.940]   - Did you publish the full distributions?
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:31.780]   - We didn't.
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:34.880]   Our plan was actually to make a follow-on study
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:37.760]   so we could show everybody I guess probably
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.280]   they were interested where they kind of fell on the graph.
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.000]   But it was fairly, it was normally distributed.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.360]   - Yeah, we think that despite the wide availability
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.400]   of pornography that the distributions,
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.240]   like the scatter plots of all the data,
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.640]   would be interesting to men.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:00.280]   For the same reason that the testosterone
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:04.680]   by function of age data published as a scatter plot
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.640]   in that textbook I referred to earlier.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.160]   Very interesting because the scatter plot distributions,
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:15.080]   I feel like point to other takeaways
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.900]   that one can be in their 70s and have testosterone levels
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:21.280]   equivalent to a healthy male in his 30s.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:24.000]   That one can be in their 30s and have testosterone levels
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.940]   that are twice as much or half as much as age match cohort,
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:28.840]   this kind of thing.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.180]   I think there's value in that.
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:36.180]   So what other takeaways arrived with the data
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.220]   from the penis length study
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:39.860]   that perhaps we didn't hear about?
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:42.980]   Like what did you find most interesting about the data?
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:44.740]   - Well, that there was any change over time.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.780]   This was a fairly short study.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:49.340]   It was probably about 30 years or so.
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:50.740]   But we did find that penile length
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:52.220]   has been increasing over time.
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:55.500]   So that was just sort of fascinating
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.620]   that we would see sort of in such a short interval of time
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:58.900]   that there would be a change, number one,
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.020]   but that we'd see a lengthening, number two.
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:04.620]   So, again, similar to the concerns that arose
[02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:07.140]   for these relatively short period of time
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:09.940]   where you would see changes in semen quality,
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:11.820]   it suggests something sinister, right?
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.820]   It's unlikely to be a genetic change
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:17.500]   because that would take centuries probably,
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:18.620]   certainly several generations.
[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:21.080]   So the fact that this happened so quickly
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.080]   was just surprising.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.260]   - This brings to mind some of work
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:26.820]   that I was involved in years ago
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.220]   when I was a master's student.
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:31.980]   I studied early organizing effects of hormones
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:34.460]   on the brain and body.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:38.360]   And I'm sure this has been updated since then,
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:43.360]   but my recollection is that during embryonic development,
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:47.540]   males are exposed to a certain amount
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.580]   of dihydrotestosterone, not testosterone,
[02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:54.840]   but dihydrotestosterone, which organizes the brain male,
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:56.220]   as they used to say.
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.700]   Now, the verbiage around that
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:05:59.980]   would probably be a little bit different,
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:04.980]   but the idea is that males are born with penile tissue,
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:08.580]   of course, but then it's during puberty
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:10.940]   that the same hormone, dihydrotestosterone,
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:14.540]   then exerts an activating effects on the genitals
[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.500]   and the genitals grow during puberty,
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.300]   penis length increases.
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.300]   So assuming that the study that you did
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:24.640]   was on males post-puberty, I'm assuming it was,
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:28.600]   then it would imply that something's changing
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.500]   about the levels or the signaling
[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.340]   related to dihydrotestosterone.
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:36.140]   How could that happen?
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:37.980]   Do we have any ideas about what might be happening?
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.060]   I mean, this is the opposite
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:43.100]   of environmental endocrine disruptors preventing sperm
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:46.300]   from being as high quality and numerous as they could be
[02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:51.300]   or environmental factors, either in utero or post-utero,
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:54.000]   suppressing testosterone levels.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.140]   Here, we're talking about the opposite effect.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.780]   We're talking about dihydrotestosterone levels,
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:01.140]   presumably being higher in males over the last 30 years
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:04.000]   and thereby longer penises.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.080]   - Right, so I mean, I think there's different conjectures
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:07.740]   that you could make about why this could happen.
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:08.820]   I mean, it could be, you know,
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:11.900]   maybe endocrine disrupting chemicals, you know, in utero,
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:13.620]   some early exposure, you know,
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:16.740]   that some of the mothers had to kind of androgenic effects
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.100]   during the male programming window
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:20.960]   that may have led to some longer lengths.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.180]   Another hypothesis we had is that
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.620]   if males are going through puberty earlier,
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:27.080]   the earlier one goes through puberty,
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:28.820]   the longer length tends to be.
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:31.620]   So maybe that provides sort of this link.
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:34.580]   - So earlier puberty tends to be longer,
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.260]   potentially means longer duration exposure
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:40.740]   to dihydrotestosterone, longer penises.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:42.920]   Yeah, you may be surprised to know,
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:45.560]   you might not be surprised to know
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:48.000]   that there is a subculture online.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.680]   I know because they contacted me
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:51.420]   in anticipation of this episode.
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:55.940]   Of post-pubertal males
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:00.020]   who take a combination of dihydrotestosterone
[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:03.480]   and low levels of growth hormone
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:06.600]   in efforts to try and increase their penile length.
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:09.900]   And the ones taking dihydrotestosterone,
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:11.140]   they're not taking pure DHT,
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.700]   they're taking things like oxandrolone,
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:16.240]   which very closely mimics the structure of DHT.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:21.100]   They report some success.
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.980]   Fortunately, they did not send me pictures.
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.580]   Otherwise, I would have just forwarded them to you
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:27.220]   for your next study.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.540]   But this stuff is happening in post-pubertal males.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:36.480]   So it all rests on this dihydrotestosterone hypothesis.
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:38.500]   Just a point of interest.
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:39.420]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:40.960]   Just physiologically, it doesn't make sense
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:43.920]   why that would work as you're pointing out post-pubertally.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.320]   Unless they're doing other things,
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.460]   some sort of stretching exercises or I think called julking.
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:52.560]   But yeah, I would not recommend that.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:53.400]   - Thank you.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.540]   That was the response I was looking for.
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:59.540]   So that community will be listening with open ears.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:00.860]   Don't do it.
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:05.400]   As long as we're talking about DHT, dihydrotestosterone,
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.780]   it's only fair to discuss the drugs
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:12.840]   that many people take to suppress dihydrotestosterone
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.320]   in hopes to keep or grow their hair.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.500]   Things like finasteride, dutasteride.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:24.420]   Some, maybe many, not all people who take these drugs,
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:26.640]   particularly in oral form,
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.320]   experience sexual dysfunction issues
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:34.000]   and other issues related to suppressing DHT.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.120]   That said, my understanding is that these drugs
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:39.840]   are also quite useful, maybe even life-saving in some cases
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.340]   for staving off certain forms of prostate cancer.
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:46.660]   What are your thoughts about finasteride, dutasteride?
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:48.940]   Do you see people coming into your clinic
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:52.140]   who are having sexual dysfunction or other types of issues
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:55.540]   because of their hair or attempt to maintain
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.460]   or grow their hair issues?
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:00.960]   And equally important is that we talk about
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.180]   so-called post-finasteride syndrome.
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:06.320]   I got a lot of questions about post-finasteride syndrome
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.400]   because I'll describe it in a couple of minutes.
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:12.100]   It sounds pretty devastating for these people's lives.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:16.760]   And I'll explain why it's so devastating for them
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.600]   in a moment.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.360]   But what about finasteride, dutasteride
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.920]   and these drugs that are effectively DHT blockers?
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.320]   DHT levels, if they get too high,
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.680]   indeed can miniaturize the hair follicle,
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.400]   cause people to lose their hair typically upfront
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.920]   or in the back, so-called crown or whatever,
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.920]   widow's peak or everywhere in some cases.
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.840]   It also induces hair growth on the back,
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:42.480]   beard growth as we understand.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.040]   But then people go and take these drugs
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.940]   to try and maintain or grow their hair.
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.880]   And oftentimes they have erectile dysfunction
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:48.720]   or other issues.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:50.600]   Is that surprising to you?
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.280]   - I think the men that we see these side effects are,
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.560]   tend to be younger men in their 20s, 30s and 40s.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:00.040]   And they take it as you're pointing out for hair loss.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.200]   So before it was FDA approved for that indication,
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.780]   at least finasteride was,
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:06.160]   they did randomized controlled trials to look.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:09.200]   And one of the other things that we'll talk about too
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:10.440]   is just reproductive effects.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:13.160]   So they did lots of studies to see if there were changes
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.480]   in semen quality for men on finasteride versus the placebo.
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.380]   And there were some very subtle changes,
[02:11:19.380 --> 02:11:21.120]   but sort of in post-marketing now,
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.720]   we see these patients in clinic.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.740]   Everybody to enroll in these studies had normal function.
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:28.680]   So I think that's sort of important to understand.
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.240]   And obviously that's not life, right?
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:32.800]   That people come in with sort of different baselines
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.200]   and different amounts of reserve.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.120]   And so we now know that there's probably people
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:37.080]   that are a lot more sensitive
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.720]   to these medications than others.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.800]   And so there are some men that drop
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:42.320]   their sperm counts dramatically.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.600]   And usually if we stop these medications,
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.100]   their sperm counts can recover.
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:48.560]   And usually the spermatogenic cycle
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.800]   is probably about two to three months.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.880]   So usually in maybe three to six months,
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.520]   we usually see recovery for most men.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.000]   But similarly for sexual function,
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.620]   I certainly have a number of patients
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:02.000]   that do complain of low libido erectile function,
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.680]   this post finasteride syndrome.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:06.400]   And the mechanisms I think are less certain
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.300]   because measuring testosterone levels,
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:10.960]   which we do, sometimes if androgens are low,
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:13.380]   or even if androgens seem to be in the maybe normal range
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:14.220]   or low normal range,
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:16.560]   we'll try and increase testosterone
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:17.560]   through a variety of means.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.520]   Testosterone, clomiphene sometimes will give.
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:21.940]   It helps some men, but not all.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.640]   So I think the exact mechanism of what is going on here,
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:30.640]   what is changing, I think we need more understanding
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.880]   about the exact sort of pathophysiology or neurochemically.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.720]   - It seems like a pretty serious trade off
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.280]   to either maintain or grow hair or lose sexual function.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.020]   I mean, I've talked about DHT
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:48.180]   and some of these side effects of finasteride,
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:50.880]   dutasteride on previous episodes.
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.660]   And, you know, I'm not a clinician,
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:54.360]   but my encouragement is always for people
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.420]   to approach these drugs with a real level of seriousness,
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:00.040]   if not caution.
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:02.620]   The post finasteride syndrome was described
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:06.080]   in these online questions as seemingly permanent,
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:11.080]   even though people had ceased to take finasteride
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:11.940]   or dutasteride.
[02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:14.680]   So in other words, they were taking this stuff.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.000]   I don't know how they felt while they were on it,
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.380]   but they stopped taking it.
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:20.240]   And the sexual dysfunction issues
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:22.160]   don't seem to be resolving.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:24.640]   Does that mean they should go see you
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.880]   or another male urologist reproductive health specialist?
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:31.740]   - Yeah, I mean, oftentimes they do for these complaints.
[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:35.000]   They start to notice that when they're on the medication,
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.340]   then when they usually through online research
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:39.360]   kind of learn about this potential entity,
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.760]   sometimes they discontinue.
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.840]   Now, some men do have resolution when they stop,
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.800]   but there is this permanence in some handful of men.
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:48.200]   You know, they've done MRI imaging
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:50.840]   to try and understand sort of more anatomically
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:52.440]   or functionally what exactly is going on.
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.880]   I think there's still a lot of unknowns about it,
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.000]   but it can be permanent for some.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.480]   So they come in and they see me in clinic,
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:00.880]   erectile dysfunction, low libido,
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:02.960]   and then we go down to all the host of treatments
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.440]   that we talked about and evaluations that we talked about.
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:06.800]   Again, we have resolution in some,
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:09.360]   but there are some that seem treatment refractory.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.460]   - Yikes, that's my only response.
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:16.460]   I mean, permanent effects on sexual health
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:20.640]   as a consequence of an attempt to maintain one's hair.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:23.920]   I mean, this is where, you know, in all seriousness,
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:25.440]   it just sounds like something
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.400]   that people need to think very seriously about.
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.040]   Because as I understand, there's nothing that can predict
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.040]   whether or not someone will have post-phenasteride syndrome.
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:37.140]   Right? - Right.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:41.000]   - And I did a bit of reading on this
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.600]   within the scientific journals as well.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.680]   There isn't a lot of information, as you point out,
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:46.120]   'cause it's a fairly recent phenomenon
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.560]   that highlights a different issue.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.860]   This may be the first time in history
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:54.120]   where young males are taking phenasteride and dutasteride,
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:56.400]   and that might be the cause
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.640]   of the post-phenasteride syndrome, right?
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.580]   I think you alluded to this earlier.
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.440]   But these drugs have proven to be very beneficial
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:06.020]   for older men treating prostate issues.
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:07.160]   - Exactly, yeah. - Right?
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.920]   So this is a post-phenasteride syndrome,
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:12.720]   I think falls under the category of medical conditions
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.680]   that, you know, a few years ago,
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:18.600]   we would hear the same about chronic fatigue syndrome.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:21.240]   Even fibromyalgia, not long ago,
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.280]   was considered one of these,
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.720]   oh, is it all a psychosomatic issue?
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:27.200]   Now, we now clearly know that's not the case
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.400]   for fibromyalgia, by the way.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.260]   But I can recall a time not that long ago
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:34.420]   when people in the medical profession kind of like,
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:36.680]   oh, yeah, I don't know if this is a real thing,
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:39.200]   but post-phenasteride syndrome sounds certainly real
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:40.560]   for the people that are suffering from it.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.580]   - Exactly, yeah.
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:43.320]   - Okay, well, the reason I'm spending so much time on this
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:45.960]   is that I get a lot of questions about it,
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.360]   and there are clearly a lot of young males
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.220]   who take phenasteride or dutasteride
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:53.140]   or are thinking of doing that for cosmetic reasons.
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:54.320]   And I think they should be aware
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.420]   of the potentially serious consequences.
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:15:57.960]   - Yeah, agree. - Yeah.
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.040]   - But you did say earlier that if someone has a penis,
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.720]   you can get it hard.
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.760]   So all is not lost even for these
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:07.600]   post-phenasteride syndromes and-
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.240]   - That's true. - Good, okay.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.780]   We'll hold you to that. [laughs]
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:13.040]   You mentioned clomiphene.
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:18.240]   Could you explain what clomiphene is and what it's used for?
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.240]   Because, again, we want this discussion to be centered
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.800]   around the real science, the real medicine,
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:29.660]   but there is a growing sub-community of people out there
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.800]   who are saying, "Okay, testosterone therapy
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.760]   can cause these sperm suppressive issues
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.320]   and perhaps some other issues."
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.160]   But doing nothing might not be an option
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:43.120]   for somebody who wants to increase their whatever libido,
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.420]   other aspects of androgen function.
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:50.280]   And so there are a growing number of people out there
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.760]   who are taking clomiphene only
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:55.520]   in order to presumably increase testosterone.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.940]   But my understanding is that it would impact
[02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:00.500]   the estrogen pathway as well.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:01.780]   Yeah, what's clomiphene?
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:04.740]   What are your thoughts about people using clomiphene,
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:08.560]   sort of off-label, simply to increase androgens?
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:11.000]   Seems sketchy to me for reasons related
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.140]   to changes in neural circuits.
[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:16.180]   But you'll tell us how it works.
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:18.040]   - Well, thank you for including the off-label disclosure.
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:21.500]   Anytime I talk about this, I always have to say that.
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.240]   So clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:26.040]   So basically it blocks estrogen.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:27.760]   And so from our earlier discussions
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:29.680]   of how the pituitary works,
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:31.260]   there's sort of an elaborate feedback loop
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:33.760]   between the pituitary and the gonads
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.000]   and the man, the testes.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.760]   And so what happens is FSHLHC's gonadotropin
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:41.380]   stimulate the testicle to make sperm and testosterone.
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.640]   Testosterone is peripherally converted to estrogen
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:46.760]   and that feeds back on the hypothalamus to stop that.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:48.940]   So again, you don't get an overproduction.
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:50.960]   So by blocking the estrogen receptor
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:53.760]   at the level of pituitary or the hypothalamus,
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:55.440]   you'll stop that.
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.200]   And so the idea behind blocking that
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:59.800]   is that you'll get more production of FSHLHC's,
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:01.200]   more of these drivers.
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:02.800]   So you get more testosterone,
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:05.040]   you get a higher stimulation of the testicle.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:06.880]   You know, the hope is that for fertility
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.040]   that sometimes it can improve sperm production too.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.200]   And there's some limited data that can help.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:12.920]   But I think as you're alluding to,
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.660]   it's sort of a way to just augment
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:16.920]   your body's own production of testosterone.
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:17.960]   So it certainly does that.
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:20.960]   I think there's no question that testosterone levels do rise.
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:23.200]   I think that the reason that doesn't always help
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.880]   is because not every problem is solved by testosterone.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:29.240]   We kind of talked about somewhat in this discussion,
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:30.240]   but also that, you know,
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:32.600]   you do need some estrogenic signaling as well.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:35.400]   And so by blocking that, you know, even partially,
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.120]   'cause there's also some partial agonist effects
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:40.620]   of clomiphene as well, it may limit it.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:42.720]   And, you know, it turns out that estrogen signaling
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.260]   is important for a lot of things.
[02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:46.340]   It's important for, you know, bone health,
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:48.400]   but sexual health too, it's important for libido.
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:50.520]   So that may be partially blunting
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:52.780]   some of the hope for benefits of testosterone.
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.460]   I found that men tend to be happier
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.420]   on testosterone than some of these other forms,
[02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:59.140]   and that could be a possible explanation.
[02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:00.800]   But one of the advantage of clomiphene,
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.620]   if we are thinking about this as a treatment
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:04.860]   for low testosterone hypergunadism,
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:07.000]   is that it doesn't have the same toxic effects
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.300]   on sperm production.
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.420]   So by maintaining the body's own production of testosterone,
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:14.140]   by maintaining production of FSHLH,
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:16.220]   we'll continue to get sperm production.
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:19.160]   So for this reproductive age man that has low testosterone
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:21.420]   and symptomatic low testosterone, you know,
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.180]   low energy levels, sex drive, mood, sleep problems,
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:27.120]   it can be a worthwhile treatment.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:30.580]   And it does help a lot of men, but not everybody.
[02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:34.380]   - I've always been curious why,
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:36.580]   if the goal is to increase sperm production,
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.780]   that the most common treatment is HCG,
[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:42.500]   human chorionic gonadotropin.
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:44.820]   Because as you mentioned earlier,
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:48.560]   luteinizing hormone and FSH, follicle stimulating hormone,
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.100]   are deployed from the pituitary,
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.620]   and travel to the testes where they stimulate
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:57.020]   testosterone production and sperm production,
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:59.000]   but it's the FSH specifically
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.480]   that encourages sperm production.
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:06.480]   So why wouldn't a man who's taking,
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:08.260]   maybe testosterone therapy,
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:11.560]   or who perhaps just wants increased sperm count and quality,
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.980]   take FSH instead of human chorionic gonadotropin,
[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:18.160]   which is more or less a proxy for luteinizing hormone?
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.180]   - That's a really good question.
[02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:20.940]   And so what FSH does, like you said,
[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:22.420]   is it stimulates sperm production.
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:24.380]   So it seems like it'd be a much more logical treatment.
[02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:27.280]   And actually, in randomized placebo-controlled trials,
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:28.320]   it does do that.
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:29.340]   So one of the reasons-- - It does not.
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:31.120]   - It does do that, it does help.
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.640]   So it's beneficial, and we should give it more.
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:35.880]   But one of the reasons that we don't is cost.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:38.020]   So it's rarely covered by insurance.
[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.940]   And HCG, a month of that is in the hundreds of dollars.
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:42.940]   So let's say like three to $500.
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:46.000]   But a month of sort of therapeutic FSH
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.940]   is probably two to $3,000.
[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:49.320]   So that cost is really limiting.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.420]   It takes two to three months to make a sperm.
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:55.280]   So men often would have to be on it for several months.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.900]   But there is reasonable data that would help.
[02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:00.220]   And it does make a lot more sense that that should be given
[02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:03.820]   as adjuvant therapy with testosterone rather than HCG.
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.460]   But HCG does work.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:07.820]   Everyone's surprised it does actually help.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:10.220]   But yeah, I agree, there is sort of a contradiction there.
[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:12.220]   So if the price came down, it doesn't,
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:15.640]   this is another off-label medication for that indication.
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:18.440]   It would be, it could be worthwhile.
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:21.300]   - One hormone that we haven't discussed is prolactin.
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:25.220]   I'm familiar with prolactin from a variety of perspectives,
[02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:28.740]   but I always think of dopamine and prolactin
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.880]   as kind of a seesaw relationship.
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.960]   Dopamine's up, prolactin is down.
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:35.640]   Dopamine is elevated with sexual desire, sexual activity,
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.180]   post-ejaculation.
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:40.680]   Prolactin goes up, sets perhaps the refractory period
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:43.200]   on erection and ejaculation for some period of time.
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.360]   Then dopamine comes back up.
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:45.720]   But you know, this kind of thing.
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:47.260]   And I realize that's far too simplistic,
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:48.660]   that prolactin is doing many things
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:51.040]   in the brain and body besides that.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:54.240]   But how often do you see hyperprolactinemias,
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:22:00.140]   I don't know if plural, prolimias is clinically correct,
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:02.380]   but elevated levels of prolactin
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:06.960]   that are causing problems for men.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.900]   What are some of the telltale signs of that?
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.500]   And this I'd like to use as a segue
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:14.860]   to talking about some of the sexual dysfunction
[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:17.800]   that is commonly discussed around the use of SSRIs
[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:20.360]   and other drugs to treat depression
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.200]   and mental health issues that sometimes create endocrine
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:27.460]   and/or sexual health issues.
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:31.380]   - Yeah, so prolactin is sometimes,
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:34.280]   it's a diagnosis, hyperprolactinemia is a diagnosis,
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:35.440]   maybe not that many times.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:38.880]   I would say less than 1% of the patients that we see
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:39.840]   will end up having that.
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:41.640]   But usually it's a handful of times a year
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:44.160]   'cause we see a lot of patients.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:46.880]   Typically the telltale sort of symptoms
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:50.460]   would be ones of low testosterone, that's a common one.
[02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:52.200]   But in my practice, I see it a lot
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:53.920]   with very low sperm production.
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:57.300]   So I've diagnosed several prolactin secreting tumors
[02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:59.480]   and the manifestation of that was,
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:00.500]   they weren't getting pregnant.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:02.880]   We checked the sperm count, it was very low.
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.560]   That mandates a check of testosterone,
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:06.100]   which is also very low.
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:08.040]   And then that leads to a prolactin, which is very high.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:10.380]   And then that was diagnosed.
[02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:12.660]   So it's something I think to be aware of,
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:14.880]   but I don't know that there's not usually a lot of symptoms
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:16.920]   and sort of going to a clinician
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:19.440]   when you're having sexual dysfunction,
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.340]   symptoms of low testosterone or fertility problems
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:24.840]   will usually be able to diagnose if it's present.
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.080]   - Are there any other hormones in the galaxy
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:33.680]   of sexual health related hormones that fall into
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:37.980]   common clinical practice for you?
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:40.580]   - I check estrogen as well.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:41.580]   So I think that's another one.
[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.960]   It's again, because of the relationship with obesity,
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.960]   I think that can be important.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:47.080]   Sometimes there's too much aromatization.
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:50.080]   And so sometimes that can be a problem.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:51.880]   I think just like we talked about normal,
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:53.000]   estrogen signaling is important.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.580]   I think too much can be bad.
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:56.520]   So there are some men where we do see manifestations
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:58.880]   that it can manifest as gynecomastia in some cases.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:23:59.720]   - Male breast tissue.
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:01.260]   - Male breast tissue, yeah.
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:04.300]   - As I was told, what was it?
[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:08.400]   That the male breast tissue is sort of like the appendix.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:10.840]   It's there, but it's not very interesting.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.680]   - Right, right, yeah.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:13.960]   Everybody has some and we just don't want the growth
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:14.880]   to get out of control.
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:16.800]   - Could you tell us about one of the world's
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:20.520]   most difficult to pronounce words, which is varicocele?
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.280]   - Yes, so varicocele, it's a very common condition.
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:26.080]   Probably about 15% of all men have it.
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:28.400]   And it's a very common cause of infertility.
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:31.800]   If you look at all the etiologies, it can be 30 to 40%.
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:34.820]   So basically what it is is dilated veins in the scrotum.
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:36.300]   So obviously we need veins to get blood
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.640]   out of the testicles.
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.840]   But sometimes they can be a little larger than average.
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.360]   And there's sort of a normal sort of thermal regulation.
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.800]   So if the veins get too big,
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.800]   it's thought to warm up the testicle.
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:47.940]   The other thought is that it doesn't adequately clear
[02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:49.880]   some of the metabolites.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:52.760]   So exactly the pathophysiology is somewhat debated,
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:55.120]   but I think those probably contribute.
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.320]   And it's something that everybody should be evaluated for
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.100]   if you're concerned about fertility.
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:00.880]   So again, we see it very commonly.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.660]   Given the fact that a lot of men have it,
[02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:04.880]   about one in seven men have it,
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:06.000]   it doesn't always cause a problem,
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.600]   but maybe about 20 to 25% of the time it does.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.960]   So men will manifest with low sperm counts, we see.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:15.160]   Sometimes discomfort, ache, worse at the end of the day
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.460]   than at the beginning, worse at the activity.
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.780]   Anytime blood can pool, sometimes it stretches
[02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:19.840]   and some men feel that.
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:21.460]   And then in kids, sometimes it can lead
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:24.600]   to either stunted testicular growth
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.620]   or shrinkage of the testicle.
[02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.460]   It's also thought to be a progressive lesion.
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:31.120]   So the longer a man has it, the more damage it can do.
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.960]   It usually manifests around puberty in general.
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:35.600]   So it's not a concern for everybody,
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:36.880]   but I think certainly if couples
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:38.420]   are having difficulty conceiving,
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:40.840]   you're having discomfort in the area and you have one,
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:42.480]   it's a discussion you should have.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.640]   - What about Peyronie's disease?
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:47.920]   - Yeah, so Peyronie's is a scarring of the penis,
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:50.360]   which leads to curvature or deformity.
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:52.920]   So the way erections work is everything swells.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:54.500]   And you can imagine if there's a scar tissue,
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:55.660]   it doesn't swell symmetrically.
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.440]   So you'll get like a curvature deviation.
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:00.200]   Sometimes you can get an hourglass or sort of a banding.
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:02.280]   If you look it up on the internet,
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.640]   you can see a host of different deformities that men get.
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:08.440]   It's probably present in about five to 10% of men.
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.400]   So it's very common.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.240]   Sometimes it could be from injury,
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.240]   from like a penile fracture or other sort of less severe form
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:19.520]   of injury to the penis.
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:21.840]   Sometimes men have described hitting it on different things.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.000]   Potentially that could lead to it.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.000]   Sometimes it can manifest after prostate cancer surgery
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.320]   or other kinds of surgeries, which can sort of stun the penis
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:35.200]   or injure some of the nerves of the penis.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.400]   So that's another condition we see commonly.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.680]   Obviously it can lead to bother.
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:42.040]   And erections are not straight.
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.680]   That can just cause a psychological bother to men.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:48.760]   It can also physically make it difficult
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:50.080]   for a man to have sex.
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.640]   Sometimes it can limit certain positions.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.260]   So that's another common complaint we see.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.080]   I think it's something that men should be aware of.
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:58.460]   There's now awareness campaigns.
[02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:00.960]   Now there's an FDA-approved medicine for it,
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:02.300]   collagenase or Xioflex,
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:05.160]   which is a medicine that dissolves scar tissue.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:07.380]   So that's one of the treatments we have for it.
[02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:10.740]   There's also different devices, sort of stretching devices,
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:13.780]   where we try and just mechanically remodel the penis
[02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:15.780]   to allow it to be a little bit straighter.
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:18.000]   And then there's also surgical options too.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.780]   So there's a lot we can do.
[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:21.780]   I always tell men again, as long as you have a penis,
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:24.620]   we can make it hard, but we can also make it straight.
[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:29.640]   - I'm wondering why in the study about penis length,
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:34.280]   testicular size and volume wasn't also measured.
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:36.600]   And that's something that we haven't discussed.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.000]   What is the relationship between testicular size and volume
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.900]   and some of the other parameters we've been talking about?
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:46.200]   And maybe this is also a good time to highlight
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:51.040]   any kind of morphological signals
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:54.360]   that would warrant people coming to the clinic.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.680]   So asymmetry in testicle size, for instance,
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:02.080]   changes in testicular size, obviously a pea-sized lump
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.780]   they taught us in high school is a warning sign
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:08.560]   of potential testicular tumor or cancer.
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:12.620]   We didn't really talk about testicles.
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.580]   - Yeah, so I think that kind of being aware,
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:19.040]   the average size of a testicle for a man is about,
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:20.200]   it's sort of about a walnut.
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:22.600]   So it's about 16 to 20 CCs.
[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:24.840]   Usually if you were gonna measure it,
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.360]   it'd be about four to four and a half centimeters
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.780]   and longest axis to give your listeners
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:32.840]   or viewers some idea.
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:34.440]   If it changes, certainly let people know.
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:35.700]   If you feel anything, let people know.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:40.700]   Although our national guidelines on screening practices
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:44.760]   recommends against regular testicular self-exams,
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:46.920]   interestingly, because I think the concern
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:48.680]   is that it leads to more anxiety
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:50.600]   than cancers that it would diagnose.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:52.200]   But I think, I always tell men,
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.640]   no one knows your scrotum better than you.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.640]   So if you identify a problem,
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:56.700]   you should bring it to attention.
[02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:59.660]   So the classic appearance or the way
[02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:03.640]   that a testis cancer manifests is a firm painless mass
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.800]   that you kind of feel coming from the testicle.
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:10.540]   - I find it interesting that, at least as I understand,
[02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:13.060]   women are encouraged to do regular self-exams
[02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:15.000]   of their breasts for lumps.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.320]   But you're telling me that men are actually discouraged
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:19.540]   from doing regular exams of their testicles
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:21.040]   for lumps that could be cancer.
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:24.480]   That feels like a unfair asymmetry.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.120]   It does, I mean, cancer, I mean,
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:30.380]   both seem very important.
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:31.840]   - Oh yeah, well, I think there's no question,
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:32.920]   obviously, I'm very biased.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:34.280]   - Yeah, yeah, I was trying to say it
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.480]   so you didn't have to, right?
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:36.880]   - Oh yeah, I don't want to get in trouble
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:37.700]   with the US preventative services task force.
[02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:39.980]   - I mean, I don't want anyone to get cancer.
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:42.900]   I mean, so I don't even want a dog to get cancer.
[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:47.440]   So I'm surprised that they discourage self-exam.
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:50.080]   But is it because men are getting it wrong?
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:51.040]   They're coming into the clinic
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:52.520]   thinking they have testicular cancer
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:54.360]   and then most of the time they don't?
[02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:56.000]   - I think that's the concern that, you know,
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.980]   the number of cancers that are diagnosed
[02:29:57.980 --> 02:30:02.980]   versus the false lumps that they identify
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:05.840]   just lead to more anxiety
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:08.660]   and end up not actually causing more harm than good,
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:09.680]   I think is the concern.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:12.400]   But yeah, it was a surprising recommendation
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:13.480]   when it came down.
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:14.680]   Usually if patients ask about it,
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:16.960]   I certainly don't discourage them from doing these exams.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.040]   And I have, we've certainly identified cancers
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:20.600]   through that means before.
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:21.920]   - Well, I saw the episode of ER
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:23.560]   where the guy was having trouble breathing
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.720]   when he was an elite runner
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:26.520]   and it turned out he had testicular cancer
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:28.680]   and he had overlooked the lump on his testicle.
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:30.840]   So I'm going to continue to self screen.
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.840]   - Okay, fair enough.
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:33.620]   - Numerous times today,
[02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:35.700]   we've talked about the potential benefit
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:38.940]   of getting a blood test for hormone profiles, lipid profiles
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:41.240]   and other things, as well as a sperm analysis.
[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:45.520]   My understanding is that one can only do that
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:47.760]   if they have the disposable income
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:51.180]   to elect to do that through some commercial online service.
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:57.120]   But is there any way that patients who have insurance
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.360]   can approach their physician
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:02.560]   in a way that this would be covered by insurance?
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:04.320]   I don't want to get you into any trouble here,
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:07.620]   but you know, it's always such a shame.
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:10.680]   It is such a shame when we're talking about something
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:15.680]   that is really pervasively related to health
[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:18.580]   as is sexual health, reproductive health.
[02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:22.420]   And people are not aware of a potential problem
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:23.800]   in the present or in the future
[02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:25.080]   that could have been mitigated
[02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:27.800]   simply because they didn't get a blood test
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:30.960]   or do something as simple as a sperm analysis.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:35.000]   So we can't be presumptuous in saying,
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.140]   "Oh, well, you know, $200 or $1,000, no big deal."
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:40.300]   I mean, for a lot of people, that's a huge deal.
[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:42.780]   It's prohibitive for many people.
[02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:45.560]   So how can people get this stuff assessed?
[02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:48.640]   Should they talk to their primary care physician?
[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:50.720]   Should they call a urologist?
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:52.120]   What's the best approach?
[02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:53.520]   - Yeah, I think both are good strategies.
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:56.440]   I think, you know, insurance is becoming a lot more open
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.740]   to covering some infertility, at least testing,
[02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:59.820]   sometimes treatment as well.
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:02.440]   So I think a lot of insurance does cover that now.
[02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:04.600]   You know, sometimes we check semen analyses
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:06.580]   for other jacketory issues.
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:09.200]   But I think that, you know, again,
[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.480]   as more of this data gets out,
[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:12.620]   I think as more recognition how important the mail is,
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:15.540]   I think we'll get sort of more buy-in and coverage.
[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:16.860]   Obviously, women have, you know,
[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:19.300]   the automatic feedback of obituary cycles.
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.980]   So they kind of know if there's a problem,
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:23.180]   they can bring that to the attention.
[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:24.900]   But men don't have that feedback
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:26.660]   without some of these testing.
[02:32:26.660 --> 02:32:28.420]   - Yeah, and we probably should have mentioned this earlier.
[02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:31.180]   So forgive me, this was on me to mention that
[02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:33.060]   when we talk about sperm quality
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:35.500]   and we sort of shifted back and forth to semen quality,
[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:40.140]   it's possible to have normal semen volume
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:41.860]   and have very low sperm count, right?
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:42.700]   We're not talking about
[02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:44.420]   the total amount of ejaculate per se.
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:47.420]   We're talking about the density of forwardly motile,
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:51.580]   healthy, non-DNA fragmented sperm in that semen, right?
[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:56.020]   So in other words, it's not sufficient to just assume
[02:32:56.020 --> 02:32:59.580]   because you can ejaculate that your sperm are healthy.
[02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.420]   - That's exactly right.
[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:01.380]   Yeah, I mean, I think, you know,
[02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:03.660]   about 15% of men have low semen quality,
[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:06.940]   whether it be concentration, movement, shape.
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:09.180]   About 1% of men have no sperm in the ejaculate.
[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:11.340]   And that's something sometimes they have no idea about.
[02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:12.260]   So the only way to know
[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:14.300]   would be to actually do a formal test.
[02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:16.020]   - Well, I'm encouraging people
[02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.980]   to get these parameters assessed.
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:20.680]   And I'm making that statement
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:23.120]   because it's very clear based on everything
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:23.980]   that you've told us today
[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:27.720]   that sperm quality and hormone levels
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:29.580]   are just oh so important,
[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:33.880]   not just for sexual health, but for urinary health
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:37.020]   and for reflecting prostate health
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.820]   and other aspects of whole body health.
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:42.660]   And sexual health relates directly to mental health, right?
[02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:44.980]   Now, we didn't talk so much about the psychogenic issues,
[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:48.500]   but the two go hand in hand, exactly.
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:51.540]   I wanted to thank you so much for coming here today
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:53.580]   and sharing so much knowledge with us.
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:55.000]   I mean, these really are the issues
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:59.020]   that males think about and wonder about
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:01.180]   and have questions about.
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:05.080]   And they do so to varying degrees,
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:07.220]   depending on where they're at in life.
[02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:12.220]   But I think especially for younger men who are hearing this,
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:15.260]   who are not at the point where they want to conceive,
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:17.340]   it's really important to start thinking about these issues
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:18.740]   for all the reasons you mentioned.
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:20.980]   I think these issues are really important
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:22.980]   for women to know about as well,
[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:24.460]   just as it's important for men
[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:27.380]   to understand female reproductive health
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:30.180]   and to not just improve communication,
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:34.220]   but this after all is at the heart of the presence
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:35.740]   and proliferation of our species.
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:38.140]   So thanks for taking care of the male half
[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:42.260]   and thanks for doing the work you do, it's incredible.
[02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:43.340]   The large scale studies,
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:48.140]   the more detailed studies on smaller populations,
[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:51.460]   you asked the questions that it seems many people
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:55.020]   are just afraid to ask and you get right in there
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:58.220]   and come out with the really rigorous data and answer.
[02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:00.140]   So thank you so much for what you do.
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:00.960]   - My pleasure, thank you.
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:03.620]   Thank you for highlighting men's reproductive health.
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.440]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:44.560]   Not during today's episode,
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:47.340]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:48.580]   we discuss supplements.
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:50.760]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.080]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:55.780]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support,
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:57.180]   and improving focus.
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:35:59.060]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:00.540]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:03.100]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:06.280]   so livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:08.160]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.860]   it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:13.980]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:15.500]   Threads, Facebook, LinkedIn.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.700]   And on all those places,
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.660]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:20.140]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:21.560]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.460]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:24.660]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:28.080]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:29.240]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:31.500]   to our monthly Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.260]   the Neural Network Newsletter is a completely
[02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:36.500]   zero cost newsletter that gives you podcast summaries,
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:39.140]   as well as toolkits in the form of brief PDFs.
[02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:42.380]   We've had toolkits related to optimizing sleep,
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:46.060]   to regulating dopamine, deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:49.620]   mental health, learning, and neuroplasticity, and much more.
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:51.420]   Again, it's completely zero cost to sign up.
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:54.340]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go over to the Menu tab,
[02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:57.020]   scroll down to Newsletter, and supply your email.
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:59.220]   I should emphasize that we do not share your email
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:00.460]   with anybody.
[02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:01.740]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:04.380]   for today's discussion with Dr. Michael Eisenberg.
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:06.620]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:08.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:13.480]   (upbeat music)
