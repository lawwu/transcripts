[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter and the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.200]   The seventeenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:29.880]   For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.200]   For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.900]   We are studying at the moment what is customarily called the prologue of John's Gospel, these
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.720]   first eighteen verses in which the apostle introduces the great message and theme of
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.040]   his Gospel.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.160]   And we are doing so for a very particular reason.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.400]   It is, I am venturing to assert, the very reason which led the apostle himself ever
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   to write the Gospel at all.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.040]   We must always remember that the Gospels, the four Gospels, as well as the epistles,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   were written to churches.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.160]   They were not documents which were written for the world.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.080]   They were written specifically for Christian people, for believers, for members of the
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.440]   Christian church.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   And they were written because they had become necessary.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.560]   And they had become necessary because of a certain confusion which had arisen in the
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.400]   life of the church on many grounds, not only in practice, in conduct and behaviour, but
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.320]   there was a good deal of confusion with regard to this all-important matter of the very person
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.120]   of the Lord himself and what it is he has made possible for those who believe in him.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.160]   And that is why John wrote his Gospel.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.520]   He says at the end, do you remember, in chapter 20, the end of chapter 20, "These things
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   write we unto you that these things are written that ye may know that Jesus is the Christ,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.080]   the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name."
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.280]   That was the reason.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.120]   The only way to get this life is to believe this truth concerning him and what he has
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   done.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.880]   And why I am calling attention to it, I say, for exactly the same reason.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.560]   Surely the greatest need of all in the world this morning is that the church herself should
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.600]   be as she is meant to be.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.160]   The need was never so great.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.600]   The world is helpless.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   The church alone has the message.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   But is she delivering the message?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   Are men and women aware of what we have and what we offer?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.560]   In other words, to me the most urgent question is this, is the state and the condition of
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.120]   the Christian church herself?
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   Are we exemplifying this teaching?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.760]   Are we giving the impression that the Christian message is indeed the most wonderful and glorious
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.640]   thing that the world has ever heard or ever known?
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   Are we men and women of whom it can be said that we are rejoicing in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.280]   with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.560]   Are we men and women who give the impression that we know and have received the unsearchable
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840]   riches of Christ?
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.520]   Are we giving the impression that we are complete in him, or to use the language of this prologue,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   can we say, of his fullness of all we receive and grace for grace?
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Now that's why I'm calling attention to this.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.520]   Is it not obvious that somewhere or another we are failing, somewhere or another we've
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   gone astray?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   Far too often we give the impression that as Christians we are miserable, and that the
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.720]   main effect of Christianity is to make us miserable and to take from us something.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.680]   And so the world appears to be happier than the church, which is all wrong and misleading,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.080]   of course.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.400]   And therefore it behoves us to examine ourselves and to discover the cause of our condition.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.640]   Are we rejoicing in the Lord this morning?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.920]   Do we say that we are of all things and abound because we are in him?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.320]   Now the suggestion is that if that is not our state and condition, it is essentially
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   due to this, our failure to realize the truth concerning him and what he has made possible
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.560]   for us by his work on our behalf.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.360]   So we are examining this, and we see that the apostle divides it up in various ways.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   The first thing we had to consider was this, inadequate views of the person himself.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.840]   It's almost incredible, but it's so true, that there are so many of us who are Christian
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.040]   who somehow seem to forget that the Son of God has literally come into this world in
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.000]   order to save us and to give us a share in this great salvation.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.640]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.600]   Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   Now we should be people who reflect this, that this is God's salvation, a salvation
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.720]   which has been provided for us in such an astonishing manner, even by the incarnation
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   and by the life, death, and resurrection and ascension of the Son of God.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.080]   So we have to start with that.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.760]   Then having considered that, we came to a second point, which is emphasized in the fifth
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.720]   verse we were looking at last Sunday morning.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.960]   The light, he is the light.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.360]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   He is the light.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.500]   John the Baptist just came to bear witness to the light.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.880]   He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.080]   That was the true light, which lighted every man coming into the world.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.040]   Very well, but we saw this.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.120]   The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   Though the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, the world didn't recognize him.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.640]   He was in the world, and the world was made by him, yet the world received him not.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.320]   He came unto his own, the Jews, and his own received him not.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   Well, why?
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.080]   Well, because of the darkness, the darkness in which they dwelt, and the darkness that
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   was in them.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.400]   And this is still the trouble.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.600]   The world rejects him this morning because of this darkness, and the extent to which
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.960]   you and I are failing to recognize his glory and to realize what he's done for us and
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.800]   to rejoice in it.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.480]   That is the measure, I say, of the darkness that still remains in us.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.600]   It's the darkness.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.440]   That's always the cause of the trouble, and we work that out.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.040]   But now this morning we come on to a different aspect of this matter, another theme, another
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.160]   subdivision, if you like, because you see, here is the problem, stating it again fundamentally.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.760]   Not merely why doesn't the world recognize him, but why don't we?
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   Why isn't the Church filled with life and power and vigor and joy and thanksgiving and
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   praise?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   Why not?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.840]   Well, there we've looked at two of the reasons, and we're going to look at another one this
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   morning.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   And this one is, of course, our failure to see what he has done for us in terms of the
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   law.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.880]   Now that's the very matter that is dealt with in this seventeenth verse in this prologue.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.560]   It's a subdivision of the general theme.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.600]   In a prologue you introduce your themes that are going to be worked out in greater detail,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.720]   and that's exactly what the apostle does at this point.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.880]   Now this is, therefore, one of his major themes, which is a subdivision of this great central
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   theme.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:18.760]   Our failure, I say, to realize what the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Eternal
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:27.720]   Word, has done for us in terms of the law, or our relationship to the law.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.360]   Very well, the first thing we have to do, therefore, is to look at our text and make
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.800]   quite certain that we are clear as to the meaning of the text itself.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:42.840]   "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.720]   Now then, this is a verse that's often misunderstood.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.640]   The first thing we have to indicate is that this statement is not meant to depreciate
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.400]   the law, or to dismiss the law as if it were of no value at all.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.240]   There are many who have interpreted it like that, that John is saying here, "The law
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.680]   was of no value at all.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   Forget it.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   Forget all about it.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.020]   Dismiss it."
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.280]   In this Christian era, the law shouldn't be mentioned.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.800]   Preach Christ, nothing else.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.000]   They do interpret it like that, I say, as something that's meant to depreciate the
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.360]   law, to dismiss it altogether, drive it right out of God, so that it shall never be mentioned
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   again.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.680]   I say it isn't that.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.520]   Another common misunderstanding of it is to regard the contrast that's in the verse
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   as an absolute contrast.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.400]   What I mean is this.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   There are those who interpret it as meaning this, that he's saying here, "Oh, the
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.960]   law was given by Moses, but there was no grace and truth in the law.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.440]   Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.120]   That's the contrast.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.680]   There was no grace in law.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.160]   There was no truth in law.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.320]   It's only in him that we have grace and truth.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.080]   They press the antithesis, the contrast, that the apostle is making to that extreme limit.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   Well, now why do I say that this is wrong?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.600]   Well, the answer, of course, is this, that the law, after all, was God's law.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   It is God's law, not a human law.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.120]   It isn't Moses' law.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.880]   It was simply given by Moses, through Moses, but it isn't his.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.360]   It isn't something he conjured up.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.880]   There are people who believe that, I know, but John didn't believe that.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   And we don't believe that.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.520]   We believe the scriptures which tell us that God gave the law to Moses.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.160]   He was taken up onto the mount and he was given the law in all its details.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.200]   It's God's law.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.440]   And it has been given by God.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.040]   Not only that, we are told very plainly in more than one place in the scriptures that
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.000]   it was mediated by angels.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.160]   God used the angels in order to give it to Moses, Galatians 3.19, for instance.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.440]   Talking about the law, he says it was added because of transgressions, "Till the seed
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.320]   should come to whom the promise was made, and it was ordained by angels in the hand
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.660]   of a mediator."
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.300]   We mustn't depreciate the law.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.360]   The giving of the law was in many ways the pinnacle of everything that happens in the
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.520]   Old Testament.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.120]   It was God dealing directly with his servant through the instrumentality of the angels
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   in this way.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   And the author of the epistle to the Hebrews points out exactly the same thing, where he
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.320]   exhorts in the second chapter the people to hold on to the things that they have heard,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:39.440]   and he puts it like this, "For if the word spoken by angels were steadfast, and every
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.880]   transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.480]   if we neglect so great salvation?"
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.120]   Now that's his way of referring to the law, the word spoken by angels.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   And it was steadfast.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   Well, why?
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.600]   Well, because it was God's law, and mediated in that way through the angels.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   Never speak lightly of law.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.760]   The last thing John ever intended was to depreciate the law, or to dismiss it, or to speak lightly
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.320]   of it, as if it were something of no value at all.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.720]   That's a complete misunderstanding.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   It is God's law, mediated through angels, given to Moses, and passed on by Moses to
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   the people.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.080]   But it's not only that.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:33.720]   There is, after all, in the law itself an element of grace, and of truth.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.140]   What is the meaning of the burnt offerings and the sacrifices and all the ceremonial
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.680]   of the law that was given by God to Moses for the people?
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.880]   What's the meaning of the tabernacle and the temple, and all the furniture and all
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.080]   the dress, and all the symbolism?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.200]   Well, there's only one explanation.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.360]   Why was the lamb slain morning and evening, and so on?
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.480]   Why the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer?
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   There's only one answer.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.480]   That's the element of grace.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.240]   That's the thing that points forward to the coming of the Messiah, the Christ, the
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   Deliverer.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.840]   You mustn't say there's no grace in the law.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   There is.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.360]   There is grace and truth in the law.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.600]   It was meant to convey that.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   They were all shadows pointing to the great anti-type.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:26.440]   So we must never press this antithesis, this contrast, to that ridiculous extreme.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.760]   No, no, that isn't what John intended.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.600]   What John was doing was this.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.560]   He doesn't want so much to bring down the law, to depreciate the law.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.720]   What he's out to do is to elevate and to show the superiority and the all-sufficiency
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.280]   of our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   You don't dismiss the dawn because it isn't midday sunshine.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.120]   How ridiculous it is to do this.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.160]   No, no, it's simply the difference between the partial and the complete, the preparation
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   and the fulfilment.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.840]   You mustn't dismiss the law nor depreciate it.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.640]   No, what he's anxious to do is to show the superiority, the greatness, the glory, the
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.880]   all-sufficiency of this blessed one who has come.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   So he contrasts Moses with Jesus Christ.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.720]   The law was given, grace and truth came in all its fullness in and through the Son of
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   God.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.760]   In other words, he's more or less saying here exactly the very thing that the author
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.640]   of the epistle to the Hebrews says in his first verse, where he introduces his theme
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   in much the same way.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.440]   "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past and to the farthest through
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.280]   the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his Son."
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.120]   It's God who spoke in those divers manners and in different times and forms and ways.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   Don't forget that.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.600]   It's always God speaking.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   It's God.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   He did it then like that.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.840]   He now has done it once and forever and perfectly in his Son.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.560]   But you don't deride that, you don't dismiss it, you don't despise it.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   No, no.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.440]   What he calls us to do is to realize that when the fullness has come, you don't remain
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.480]   with the shadow and with the type.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.720]   That's his first reason.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.440]   But he also had a second reason for thus putting it.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:31.760]   And that was, of course, to correct the misuse of the law of which the Jews in particular
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.280]   were so guilty.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.240]   Now that was the main trouble with the Jews.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   It was their main reason for rejecting the Son of God.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.200]   It was because they held on to the law and somehow felt that he was violating the law.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.520]   John knows that.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.160]   The real stumbling block to the Jew was the law, the law of God.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160]   But he'd misunderstood it, he'd misinterpreted it.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.400]   And therefore John is anxious that they should become clear in their thinking with regard
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.840]   to the law, what it was meant to do, what's its function and purpose, and its whole relationship
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.500]   to the gospel and this new dispensation.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.340]   So he takes up this whole question of the law that was given through Moses and grace
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.940]   and truth which have come by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.040]   Now then, there is the meaning of the text.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.920]   I trust we're all clear about that.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   Well, now then, having defined the terms of our text and having got that clear in our
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.440]   minds, let me go on to the second principle, which is this.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.680]   The importance of all this for us.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.560]   What's the value of all this to us?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.640]   Why, says somebody, you know the times are much too serious for us to spend our moment
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.440]   in some theoretical discussion about law.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.040]   I find the world very difficult to live in, says somebody.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.160]   I'm surrounded by the world, the flesh and the devil, and I've got my temptations and
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.000]   I see the whole world on fire.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.240]   And are you going to just indulge in some theoretical consideration of law and grace?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.440]   Oh, my dear sir, says somebody, you're a century at least behind the times.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.240]   We are not living in those halcyon days of mid-Victorianism a hundred years ago when
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.360]   everything was so quiet and peaceful and people had the leisure to deal with these theological
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.600]   and doctrinal problems.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:26.480]   Ah, my friend, I want to show you that this is the most relevant thing to you.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.280]   In Jesus Christ there is an absolute fullness, and you and I are meant to be receiving of
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   that fullness.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.160]   That's the way to live in this world.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.600]   The only people who have ever conquered this world and mastered life are the people who
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.720]   have received of his fullness and grace for grace.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   And if you are finding life difficult, and if you are failing, and if you're unhappy
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.840]   and defeated, do you know why it is?
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.080]   I'm going to show you.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.200]   It's because somewhere or another you're getting muddled about this whole business
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   of the law.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.560]   There's nothing more practical than this.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.240]   It was practical then, it is practical now.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.040]   I put it like this.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.640]   Why is it that we are not more thankful to God for what he's done for us in the Lord
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.520]   Jesus Christ?
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.000]   Why is it that we are not filled with a sense of praise and of thanksgiving perpetually
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and always?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Why is it?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   What's the matter?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.840]   Well, I suggest that it's all due to this failure on our part to realize the truth of
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.360]   the text that we're looking at this morning.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.760]   Now this is something that happens in two main ways, and I want to put them before you.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.720]   Should every man examine himself as to which of the two groups we belong to?
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.160]   The first danger, the first tendency on our part always, is the one I've already been
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:57.280]   referring to, namely to dismiss the law, and not to allow it to do its work in us and upon
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   us.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:06.160]   Now I believe that this is the peculiar difficulty with those of us who call ourselves evangelical.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.920]   I think this is the commonest misunderstanding amongst evangelicals, to dismiss the law.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.600]   Say, "We don't want law now, we are in the New Testament, we are preachers of grace."
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   You don't preach law any longer, you preach Christ only, offer salvation in his name.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.340]   Now let me show you the fallacy there.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:34.000]   It is the fallacy of regarding grace as something which dismisses the law altogether.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   But I say that that is a terrible fallacy, that grace was never meant to dismiss law,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.160]   and it must never be regarded as something that does so.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.120]   Now I've got the authority of the great Apostle Paul himself for saying this.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.560]   If ever there was a preacher of grace, it was the Apostle Paul.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.560]   And of course we know that in the first section of his great epistle to the Romans, this is
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.960]   the great point he makes, especially in those first three chapters.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.400]   He had to deal with this whole problem of the law, he had to deal with it in the Jews,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.680]   he had to deal with it in the Gentiles, people were getting muddled about this, and then
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.800]   he shows them that they are now saved by grace.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.000]   And then he imagines the Jews saying, "Very well then, you are saying that the law was
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   of no value.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.560]   It was a mistake, it didn't do any good."
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.040]   So he puts it like this at the end of chapter three, the last verse in chapter three, Romans
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   3, 31.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.880]   "Do we then make void the law through faith?"
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.320]   And he's horrified at the suggestion.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.640]   God forbid, he says.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.560]   Yea, we establish the law.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.000]   You see, take the context of that now.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   "Where is the boasting then," he says after he's outlined the great way of salvation,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.240]   "it is excluded."
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   By what law?
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   Of works?
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.440]   Nay, but by the law of faith.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:04.680]   Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.160]   Is he the God of the Jews only?
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.760]   Is he not also of the Gentiles?
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.080]   Yes, of the Gentiles also, seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.120]   faith and uncircumcision through faith.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.440]   Do we then make void the law through faith?
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.960]   God forbid.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.920]   Yea, we establish the law.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.040]   Don't imagine for a moment, says the apostle, that my argument, my reasoning means that
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.360]   I'm making the law void, saying there's nothing in it and of no value, that you forget all
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   about it and this way.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.520]   Never, he says, God forbid that, we are establishing the law.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   What's he mean by that?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.720]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.280]   And this is the real exposition of this verse.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.360]   Grace can only be measured truly in terms of law.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.280]   You will never know the real value and meaning of grace until you've understood the teaching
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   concerning the law.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.320]   In other words, you and I will never know what the grace of God in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:21.760]   has really done for us until we realize deeply that it has saved us from the condemnation
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.920]   of the law.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   It's the only way to measure grace.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.920]   We'll never know what grace is.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.360]   We can't appreciate grace except in terms of our understanding of our position under
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   the law.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:41.040]   Now, let me hold before you the perfect statement of that, the most perfect exposition of that
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.240]   that has ever been given.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.400]   And it is that incident which is recorded in that seventh chapter of the gospel according
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:55.480]   to St. Luke from verse 41 to 50, which we read at the beginning.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   You remember the incident.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.320]   Our Lord is invited into the house of a Pharisee to have a meal.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.680]   And our Lord sits down or he climbs upon the couch and a woman, a great sinner in the city,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.760]   came along and she began to wash his feet with her tears and to wipe them then with
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.720]   the hair of her head.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.960]   And the self-righteous Pharisee was amazed at this.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.120]   He said if this man were a prophet, he'd know exactly what this woman is and what she's
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   been.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.000]   And so to touch him, not even to come near to him, leave alone to do what she's doing
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   to him now.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.640]   This man's not a prophet.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.440]   And our Lord realized what was in his mind, so he said, "Simon, I have something to
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   say unto thee."
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.360]   And he said, "Masters, begone."
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.800]   And he began to speak, you remember, about those two debtors which a certain man had,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.200]   most important teaching this, and often misunderstood.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:57.560]   He said here a certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.840]   And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.200]   "Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.560]   Simon answered and said, "I suppose that he to whom he forgave most."
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.040]   And he said unto him, "Thou hast rightly judged."
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.400]   And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, "Sayest thou this woman," and then he goes
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.560]   on, you remember, to draw the contrast between Simon and the woman.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.800]   Simon receives our Lord with great politeness, but he doesn't anoint his head and he doesn't
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.720]   wash, give him no water to wash his feet.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.240]   He didn't kiss him, very polite and formal.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.800]   But the woman, there she is kissing his feet, washing his feet with her tears, wiping them
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.480]   with the hair of her head, and then anointing them with the most precious oil which should
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.560]   have been used on our Lord's head by Simon, who was his host.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.200]   This is an amazing contrast.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.240]   And what's it due to?
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.920]   Well our Lord gives this explanation in verse 47.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.560]   "Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much,
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:09.360]   but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.000]   What's he mean?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.280]   It looks at first as if he's saying this, doesn't it?
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.240]   The more you sin, the better it is, because the more you sin, the more will be forgiven
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   to you, and the more that will be forgiven to you, the more you will love.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.760]   "Now said our Lord to these men, this woman's treating me like this, and in a manner so
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.400]   different from you, because she realizes the greatness of my forgiveness to her.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   You've treated me as you've done, because you don't realize my great love to you and
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.120]   the forgiveness of your sins."
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.560]   Is he putting a premium on sinning?
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.520]   Is he saying it's a good thing for us to sin very heavily and deeply in order that we shall
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.200]   have more forgiven and therefore love more?
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.920]   Of course, the thing is a sheer impossibility.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.120]   Well what is he teaching?
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   Oh, what he's teaching is this.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.000]   It is the realization of the forgiveness of sins that matters.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.960]   The woman realized that she'd been forgiven.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.460]   Simon didn't.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.400]   Being a proud Pharisee, he didn't see any need of forgiveness.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.160]   He'd never lived this adulterous life of this woman.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.560]   He'd been a very good and respectable man, like the Pharisee in the other parable of
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.040]   our Lord in Luke 18.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.880]   He gives a tenth of his goods to the poor.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.320]   He fasts twice in the week.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.960]   He doesn't see any need of forgiveness.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.240]   That man never asked God.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.320]   He says, "God, I thank Thee that I'm not as other people."
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.640]   He doesn't see the need of forgiveness.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.760]   He hasn't received any, so he doesn't love.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.240]   But that doesn't mean that he didn't need forgiveness.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.960]   It doesn't mean that he wasn't a sinner.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.840]   Of course he was a greater sinner than the woman because of spiritual pride, which is
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.760]   the greatest sin of all, or the failure to realize your sinfulness.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   That's the trouble, says our Lord.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.880]   People don't love me because they don't realize what I've done for them.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.480]   To whomsoever, he says, little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.920]   Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.160]   Well now then, here is the whole point.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.960]   What is the state of your love and mine to the Lord this morning?
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.800]   Do we love him?
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.960]   Do we rejoice in him, I ask again, with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:31.140]   Can we say with Peter, whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.000]   yet believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.040]   How much love do you feel to this blessed Savior, the Word that was made flesh and died
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.240]   for you?
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.960]   To what extent do we love him?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.480]   The answer is this.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.760]   The extent to which we realize the greatness of the forgiveness that we receive in him
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.520]   and through him.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.320]   And what makes us realize the depth and the greatness of the forgiveness?
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.280]   There is only one answer.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.920]   That is our consciousness of our sinfulness and our need of forgiveness.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.660]   And the thing that gives us that is the law.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.360]   Nothing else.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   Nothing else.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.520]   So you see, you'll never appreciate grace until you've understood the teaching of
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.000]   the law and have seen yourself under the law.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.380]   So a man who dismisses the law, he'll never know much about grace, and he doesn't.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.760]   And that is a part of our trouble.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.240]   We've dismissed the law.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.880]   And because we've dismissed the law, we've never realized our true need.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.360]   We are too healthy.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.520]   We are too light-hearted.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.880]   We talk too glibly about loving the Lord.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   But it's not a glib thing, it's a very deep thing.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.920]   It's the sort of thing that makes somebody do what that woman did to him.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.080]   It's the profoundest emotion conceivable.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.280]   But you see, we talk lightly about loving the Lord.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   We know these things.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.580]   We repeat the phrases.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.280]   But I'm asking, my friends, are we not too healthy?
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   Are we not too light-hearted?
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.160]   Are we not too glib?
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.040]   Have we ever known deep repentance?
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.080]   Have we ever known sorrow for sin?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.000]   Have we ever known the plague of our own heart?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.760]   These are the people who love the Lord.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.600]   Our Lord himself has taught it there in the parable that he uttered in the house of Simon.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:33.200]   To how much is forgiven, the same loveth much.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.240]   And nothing gives us a realization of how much has been forgiven us, except we see ourselves
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.940]   under the law of God and its condemnation.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.360]   Don't you dismiss what was given through Moses?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.320]   You'll never know much about grace if you do.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.040]   That's a complete misunderstanding.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.920]   The trouble with us, my friends, is that we've been healed too quickly, too lightly.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.440]   We're in too much of a hurry.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.480]   We want relief and we want peace.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:10.160]   No, no, the trouble with us is that we've substituted a believism for faith.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.720]   We've rushed to grace before the law has done its work upon us.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   We've dismissed the law.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   We're impatient with the law.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.520]   We want Christ presented positively.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.280]   We want to come immediately to the gospel.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.840]   We don't want introductions.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.080]   And because we don't want introductions, we have no gospel finally.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:30.160]   No, no, we must be clear about this.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:40.000]   There is only one way to know and to appreciate the grace of God in Jesus Christ, and that
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.280]   is to know the depth of iniquity that is brought out by the law that was given through Moses.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.840]   Therefore, I say, let us examine ourselves in the light of this.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.600]   Do you find yourself, as you face this great prologue, do you find yourself saying to yourself,
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.200]   "Well, am I a Christian at all?
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.240]   I don't thrill unless I think of him.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.800]   I can't say I love him like that.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   I can't say that I'm living to him and to his glory.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.280]   What's the matter with me?"
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.240]   Examine yourself in terms of law, my friend.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.800]   Have you been healed too quickly?
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:16.600]   Were you forced or pressed to some decision before you really knew your need of Christ?
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.680]   It is the one to whom much is forgiven that loves much, and to whom little is forgiven
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.480]   the same loveth little.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.040]   If our love is small, it's because we don't feel we've been forgiven much.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.540]   And we don't feel we've been forgiven much because we've never seen our need of forgiveness.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.440]   And we've never seen our need of forgiveness because we've never listened to the law that
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.560]   was given through Moses by God.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.880]   That's the trouble.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:52.040]   And it works out, of course, in exactly the same way in our whole attitude towards sanctification.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.640]   If we enter into this life in the wrong way, we'll probably continue in the wrong way,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.700]   and we tend to continue, again, avoiding the dictates of the law.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:08.560]   In other words, isn't there a tendency among us to regard sin as primarily a nuisance?
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.040]   What's our definition of sin?
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.360]   Isn't it this, as that which spoils life for us?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.700]   Don't we tend to think of sin always in a purely subjective manner?
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.700]   This thing that gets me down, that makes me miserable and unhappy.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.600]   If only I could get rid of it.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.100]   That's our approach to sin.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.640]   Sin is some sort of a nuisance in our lives, something that gets us down, something that
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   spoils our lives.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:40.200]   We tend to think of sin like that rather than to think of it in the sight of God.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.420]   We start with ourselves, we end with ourselves.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.840]   But you see, the law makes us think of sin in the sight of God, not ourselves.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.040]   "Before thee, thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight," says David.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   He'd committed a sin, he'd murdered a man, he'd committed adultery.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.320]   But what worries him is not that it's made him miserable and unhappy.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.920]   "Before thee, thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight," that's the thing.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.000]   But God hates it and he sinned against God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.840]   That's one trouble, therefore.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:25.400]   And another one is this, that we desire to be happy rather than to be holy.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   We want happiness.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.200]   So we go to our meetings, our conferences, our conventions, to get it.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   What's it?
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   This happiness.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   "Get rid of my problem, I want to be happy."
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.280]   Oh, there was a book written, you know, which has had a great influence and it's got a significant
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.320]   title.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.440]   The Christian Secret of a Happy Life.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440]   That's it.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.960]   See, always looking at us.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.180]   Happy life, come along, I'll tell you, I can make you happy quite easily.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.920]   You needn't wade through your Bible, you needn't understand theology, you needn't go this long
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.600]   roundabout way via law.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   Here you are.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.480]   The Lord's Christian Secret of a Happy Life.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.040]   But happiness doesn't come first, my friend, it's holiness.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:08.520]   The moment you put happiness in the title, you've already gone wrong.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.700]   The Christian Secret of a Holy Life is what we need to know.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.400]   You notice how our Lord himself puts it in the famous Beatitude?
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:21.920]   "Blessed are they," who are the happy ones, who are the ones that are going to be happy?
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.280]   "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for happiness."
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   No, no.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:34.840]   "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   They shall be filled.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.960]   A man was wanting happiness and saying, "Oh, I wish I could get rid of this sin.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.640]   I wish this would go or that would go."
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.800]   Happiness, then I'd be perfectly happy.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.320]   You see, that's the whole trouble I so often have to deal with.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.480]   People come to me and give me the impression that they think if only they could get rid
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.040]   of this one sin, they'd be perfectly happy.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   They've never seen themselves as sinners.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.280]   They've never understood righteousness.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.040]   It isn't the one sin that matters.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.640]   It's your whole condition before God.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:17.360]   Not happiness primarily, but holiness, righteousness, godliness, justice, truth, grace and truth
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.280]   came by Jesus Christ.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.360]   So you see that eventually in terms of this sanctification, this misunderstanding of the
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.560]   law works out into what is called antinomianism.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.160]   And antinomianism means this, that you don't recognize any law at all.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.440]   And then you say in the light of that, "Well, it doesn't matter very much what I do.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   I'm under grace.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   I'm saved.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   I'm a Christian.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   I'm now all right.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.080]   Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   The law is finished.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   We don't talk about law any longer.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.880]   We're in the New Testament now.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.240]   You don't bring law in again."
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.040]   And so many Christians are thinking that, you see, and acting accordingly.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.840]   And there's a lowering of the life.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   There's an antinomianism.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.200]   There's a living in a worldly manner.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.120]   The world enters in and everybody feels it's all right.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.760]   Grace, we are under grace.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.320]   That's sheer antinomianism.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.080]   Antinomianism is that terrible misunderstanding of grace which says, "Because you're saved,
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.340]   you're always saved, and it doesn't matter what you do."
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.200]   The first two statements are right.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.640]   Because you're saved, you are saved, and you're always saved.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   But if you go on to say, "Therefore, it doesn't matter what I do," well, then the question
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.880]   is are you saved at all?
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.520]   Because the man who's saved knows what he's saved from.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.580]   He knows what he's saved for.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.800]   And he knows that his supreme desire is to serve God and to honor him and to magnify
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   and glorify his great and holy name.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.300]   So you see, a dismissing of the law leads to those terrible consequences at every point
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.660]   in our coming into the Christian life, in our continuing in the Christian life.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:37:03.300]   It always leads to a superficial, glib, lightly happy Christian life which has a false joy.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.540]   The people who say, "I never had a doubt ever since I was converted."
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.820]   Some of them need to have doubts very much.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.540]   When you examine their lives, you see the contrast.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:17.140]   How can they be happy like that in view of the things they do and say?
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.860]   There is a false joy as well as a true joy.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.420]   And the way to get rid of that is to examine yourself in the light of the law.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.620]   Very well, there is the first misunderstanding.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.700]   Let me say just a word on the second misunderstanding before I close this morning.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.220]   If that first tendency was a tendency to dismiss the law altogether, the second is the tendency
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.540]   to mix law and grace.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.180]   The first man says, "Grace, get rid of law."
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.020]   The second man mixes grace and law.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.020]   That is equally bad.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.540]   It brings us equally into trouble.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:59.780]   Because the moment you begin to mix grace and law, well, you will have no joy at all.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.780]   Of the two, it is the better.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.060]   It is better to have no joy at all than to have a false joy.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.660]   It is better to be miserable than to assume you are all right when you are not.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.260]   But these people who mix the two, they have got no joy at all.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.260]   Why?
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.220]   Well, because they are constantly slipping back into the law in their thinking, in their
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   outlook.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:23.700]   There are many Christians who oscillate between the two, law and grace, instead of having
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.300]   these things clearly in their minds.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   How do they do that?
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:31.780]   Well, here are some instances.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.320]   If you go and ask them what it is that makes a man a Christian, they will be perfectly
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.620]   clear about it.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.380]   They realise they are saved only by the Lord Jesus Christ and his perfect work on their
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   behalf.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.700]   Then they suddenly fall into sin.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.180]   They are wretched, they are unhappy, you can do nothing with them.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   Why?
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.060]   Oh, they have put themselves back into the law again.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.500]   You see, they have left the grace position.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.580]   They have gone back again to the law.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.820]   They raise the whole question of their justification.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.980]   They doubt whether they have ever been forgiven, because they have fallen into sin.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.540]   Now, what is happening there is that they are mixing grace and law.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.460]   They have gone from the grace position back to the law position, and a Christian must
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.900]   never do that.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.100]   He is under grace, not under law.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.220]   I will explain that more fully later.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.060]   But I am just giving illustrations of this.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:27.860]   Then it sometimes happens in the matter of prayer.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:34.940]   When we are given some dim realisation of who God is and what he is, and we have been
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.820]   honest with ourselves, or we have been searched by a sermon or by a book that we have been
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:45.220]   reading, and we feel unclean and unworthy, and we say, "How can I possibly go to God
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.540]   and talk to him or enter into his holy presence?"
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.180]   And you feel you cannot pray.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.180]   Same thing again.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.180]   You have gone back under law.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.740]   You have forgotten that you are under grace.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.780]   You have mixed up grace and law.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:04.980]   And the third example is what we do in connection with sanctification.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.300]   And this is a very subtle thing.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.740]   Here we are in the Christian life.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.740]   We have believed the right things, and yet we are somehow unhappy.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:17.260]   There is a contradiction within us, and we are lacking in joy, and there is a failure
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.500]   in the life.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.180]   Somebody comes to us and says, "Now, it is quite simple.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.140]   It is all right.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.580]   You just do this, and you will be all right.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.860]   Your problems will be solved.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   Listen to me.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   Do this."
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.060]   And they are ready to listen.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.620]   That is nothing again but going back immediately under the law.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:40.420]   You see, the cults teach that kind of thing, don't they?
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.180]   The cults can always solve our problem for us quite easily.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.980]   We have only one thing to do, and everything is put right automatically.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.980]   Quite simple.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   Shortcut.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   And there we are.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.380]   The moment you accept that you are back under law for this reason.
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:01.460]   Any teaching which comes to me and says, "Only do this, and you will be all right," is always
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:05.500]   the law.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.140]   That was exactly what the false teachers were saying to the members of the Church of Galatia.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.540]   They said, "Yes, you are Christians.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.780]   That is quite all right.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.860]   But if you really want to have the fullness of blessing, you have got to submit to circumcision.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.500]   Yes, you are all right.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   But all you have got to do is just add on circumcision, and you will have had it all."
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   There is only one answer to this.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:40.820]   "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.020]   again with the yoke of bondage."
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.020]   You must not add anything.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.420]   If you try to add anything at all, you have detracted, you have taken from it all.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.140]   Did not the apostle say that?
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:59.780]   "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:06.180]   For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.740]   So that if you say, "I have only this one thing to do, and then I will be completely
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.500]   sanctified," or whatever it is you are seeking as a blessing, "If I just do this one thing,"
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.340]   yes, but it is you who are doing it.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.700]   And the moment you say, "I do," you are back under the law again.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.140]   And you have mixed up grace and law.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.420]   And all who do that, of course, find themselves in perpetual misery.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.100]   They take up teaching after teaching.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.500]   They are always trying to get this, it, this wonderful experience, this shortcut that is
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.900]   going to put everything right, and they never get it.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.900]   Why?
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.180]   Well, because, you see, they have gone back under the law.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.740]   It is they who are going to believe this or do that.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.660]   No, no, it is not like that.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:53.780]   It is of him that we receive the fullness, and it is always of him.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:00.820]   So it is as bad and as wrong and as foolish to mix up grace and law in that false way
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:07.500]   at any point as it is to dismiss the law, to deride it, and to say, "We have nothing
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   to do with it."
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:15.900]   Very well, then, there are the two chief misunderstandings with regard to this whole question of the
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.700]   relationship of law and grace.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:23.500]   And God willing, next Sunday morning, having shown how it all applies to us and how relevant
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:28.980]   it is to our daily life and living and experience, God willing, we will go on next Sunday morning
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:38.620]   to try to define what exactly, then, is the function and the value of the law, both positively
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.620]   and negatively.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:51.460]   "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath set you free, and be not entangled
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.260]   again with the yoke of bondage."
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:01.180]   Now let us sing our closing hymn, which is hymn number 373.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:12.340]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:31.540]   Well may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad."
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:45:00.180]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:28.820]   Well may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad."
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:57.460]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:26.100]   Well may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad."
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:54.740]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   Well may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad."
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:45.900]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:48:14.540]   Well may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad."
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:36.980]   "O happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God!"
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:46.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
