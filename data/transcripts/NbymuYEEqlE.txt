[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]   the more ultra-processed foods you eat,
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.980]   the worse your physical and mental health, both.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.440]   It's cardiovascular disease, it's obesity, it's diabetes,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.940]   it's mortality, it's cancer.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.980]   It's also a broad range of mental disorders.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.920]   And so we know that.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.840]   We've got more granular data that hyper-focuses on the mental health story.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.960]   You know, one study, over 300,000 people,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.340]   the more ultra-processed foods you eat, a direct linear relationship.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.360]   It was shocking how linear it was.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the worse your mental health.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.660]   And it was so striking.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.260]   It was not a subtle difference.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.280]   It wasn't like, you know, oh, it was a 3% difference between the lowest.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.500]   It was a three-fold difference.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.920]   The people who consumed ultra-processed foods every day,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.260]   multiple times a day, 58% of them had poor mental health,
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.820]   compared to only 18% of the people who rarely or never consumed ultra-processed foods.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.120]   Wow.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.160]   So this would be even just, like, somebody has, like, a bag of chips and some, you know,
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.380]   just pour-in-water type pre-made soup or something like that.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.280]   Those are ultra-processed.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.040]   This would be somebody orders a sandwich at the deli for lunch,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.780]   which can be done in a relatively healthy way, depending on what's in that sandwich,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.980]   and then does soda and bag of chips on the side.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.780]   Like, I mean, you're, that's a lot of, in my opinion, highly processed food.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.620]   But people, I think sometimes people don't think of it that way.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.860]   One of the, I was surprised and somewhat delighted to learn that one of the ways that
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.420]   the, you know, the public health folks got kids to smoke fewer cigarettes,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.920]   because when I was growing up, like, smoking was cool.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.320]   Like, if you smoke cigarettes, it was cool.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.100]   People thought it was cool.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.940]   It definitely is reinforcing because of the nicotine, the dopamine increases.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.840]   And it was considered cool.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.100]   You had your, like, Marble Man image from the preceding decades.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.240]   But then it was really the, the, the 90s kind of, it was the actors and models and stuff
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.020]   that made it cool.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.920]   Like, people smoked and it was supposed to be cool.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   And one of the ways that we ended up with people smoking far less was not just to ban it
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.740]   on campuses, because that just makes teens want to do it more, right?
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.500]   In college, you want to do it more, was to have these commercials of these, it was all
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   to be direct.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.920]   It was just like these rich white guys in a room that was portraying, like, the boardroom
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.040]   of a tobacco company.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460]   And they were, like, cackling and talking about, like, ha, ha, ha.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.580]   They think we're going to, they don't think it causes cancer and this kind of thing.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.180]   Basically, pitting youth against adults so that the youth felt like their money was being
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.920]   taken by the, by the establishment.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.460]   So is there a world where, you know, kids are going to be like, you know, forgive me,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.560]   but, you know, like, F that.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.260]   I'm not eating Doritos.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.440]   You know, like, I'm not going to be manipulated by highly processed foods, or I'm going to hold
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.680]   on to my mental health by making healthy choices in terms of food.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   It's tricky.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.120]   But it has a lot of the same parallels to cigarette use or alcohol use.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.920]   But I feel like the only way to really get Americans to change their behavior, besides
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120]   scaring them fundamentally, but even if you do that, is to incentivize it.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.620]   And one of the best incentives historically for public health change has been to pit the,
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.680]   make the public feel like they're pitted against the people that are trying to take their money
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.500]   unfairly and make them unhealthy at the same time.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   You got to activate that kind of rebellious spirit.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   No, uh-uh, not going to do it.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.960]   Just telling people it's bad for you doesn't work, right?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.540]   We know that.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.160]   How do we incentivize people?
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.100]   Yeah, I'm not going to give a cliche answer because this is the trillion dollar question
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:18.100]   that everybody's asking, and it really, you know, the health of our country really kind
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.180]   of depends on it.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:30.640]   With billions of dollars that this industry has in revenue annually, they can spend a lot
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.200]   of that money on really impactful marketing campaigns, getting people to believe that it's not as unhealthy
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.820]   as Chris Palmer and Andrew Huberman are saying.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.120]   It's fine.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.760]   Everybody deserves a treat.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:58.040]   Within the last couple of weeks, the American Heart Association was actively lobbying against
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.480]   a Texas bill that was trying to restrict spending food stamp money on junk food.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.580]   I saw that clip.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.300]   It's so disturbing to see someone from the American Heart Association actively lobbying to keep tax
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.360]   dollars directed towards including sugary soda, not even diet soda, but sugary soda in lunches
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.140]   and food for people who are low income.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:36.200]   And he went on record as saying this junk food, this ultra-processed food is not the root cause
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.320]   of obesity or diabetes or any of these health conditions, which is an absolute abject lie.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:59.280]   And when you have supposedly respected organizations being bought by industry, promoting misinformation,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   it's really hard.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.080]   You know, everybody's all upset that like, oh, people don't trust the science.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.460]   They're not respecting the respected organizations.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.640]   Well, the respected organizations need to step up and start behaving in a respectable manner.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.720]   They need to stop.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:27.260]   The American Heart Association should not be taking a dime from any industry that plays a
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.480]   role in heart disease.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   Like they, it would be like, it would be like the American Heart Association taking money from
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.020]   tobacco companies and tobacco companies and then coming out and say, smoking doesn't really cause
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.080]   heart disease, people.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   Everybody calm down.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.300]   There's still a lot that we don't know.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.680]   We need more research.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.980]   We need more research.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.940]   Smoking doesn't cause heart disease, people.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.560]   This is just scaremongering.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.020]   This is just paranoid conspiracy theories.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.560]   That is exactly what's happening now.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.660]   They're taking money from food companies that have no vested interest in the human, in the
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.300]   health of the population that they are feeding.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.660]   They know perfectly well that these foods are highly palatable.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.860]   And what does that mean?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.620]   It means addictive.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.940]   And again, if I was selling food, I would want people to be addicted to the food I was selling.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.280]   Why?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.220]   Because you sell more.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.180]   Higher margins.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.160]   If you sell food that people aren't addicted to, they'll just move on to the other food that is
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.580]   addictive and then you'll be out of business.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.860]   So it's not an easy problem to solve.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.780]   I don't mean to imply it's easy because if, if one or two companies steps up and does the
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.360]   right thing, they'll just go out of business.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.340]   Well, I feel like the, the smoking parallel is, is critical and maybe the trans fat, um,
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.980]   the history of, of entire cities banning the use of trans fats, for instance, or the use
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.920]   of a styrofoam containers, right?
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.400]   I mean, it's very different, uh, very different issue.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.440]   This doesn't directly get to human health of the styrofoam is not good, but it's about,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.080]   it's about waste and, and, um, environment.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.960]   But I feel like there has to be a top down ban and Americans also don't like bans, right?
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.920]   We don't, we don't like things we like choice, but we don't like the consequences of those
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.760]   of choice.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:34.800]   And then we want people to fix the consequences of those choices, um, with treatments that
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.660]   don't have side effects.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.880]   And then this is like kind of the cycle that, that I've observed in my lifetime over and
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.400]   over again.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.960]   You know, I think it's the rebellion piece.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.380]   It's when people realize they're being manipulated.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.940]   Once people realize they're being manipulated, I feel like that's when they're,
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:58.740]   willing to intervene, uh, and stop a, uh, otherwise reinforcing activity, uh, reinforced
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.460]   addictive activity, save money and like take a different direction.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.040]   Like that's, that's inherent to the American spirit.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.940]   As much as we love freedom, we also, we have this like, no, you're not going to, you're not
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.840]   going to do this to me kind of spirit.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.640]   We see it everywhere.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.780]   This is my belief.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.960]   But then again, I was kind of a rebellious teen, but, but if it's in service to health,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.360]   I'm, I'm hopeful.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:29.100]   I mean, my, my understanding, by no means am I an expert, but my understanding of what
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:39.480]   really drove the reduction in tobacco use was the taxes and the ban on advertising, the ban
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.040]   on television advertisements.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.780]   Interesting.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.360]   That, that when you get rid of the advertisements, you're no longer tempting people with it.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.260]   Um, you're no longer able to spread misinformation.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:58.380]   Um, and when you make the product so expensive, people just, even if they want to try it, even
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.960]   if they're already addicted to try it, already addicted to it, now they are highly motivated
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.000]   to get off of it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.380]   Why?
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.060]   Because it's costing them an arm and a leg.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.740]   Money hurts.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.620]   And, and they, and they realize that I, I just don't want this.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.200]   We could do similar things with ultra processed foods.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:23.160]   If rebellion, education, whatever, I, I don't care what works, but we're all of the above.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.140]   We're, we're, we're really fighting an uphill battle.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:34.460]   We're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're.
