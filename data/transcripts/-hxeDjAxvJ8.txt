The actual mechanism of doing the actual mechanism of doing the open source AI should be legal.

I wonder where Twitter would would think about Churchill and Hitler and Stalin, you know, I mean look to this day there, you know, there's there are lots of very interesting real questions around like how America, you know, got, you know, basically involved in World War Two and who did what when and the operations of British intelligence in American soil and did FDR this that Pearl Harbor, you know, yeah, we're doing Wilson ran for, you know, his his his candidacy was run on an anti-war will you know that he ran on the platform and not getting involved World War One somehow that switch, you know, like I'm not even

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:31.940]   two ways of looking at that, which is, oh my God, we've lost this old world in which we could trust institutions. And that was so much better. Cause like that should be the way the world runs. The other way of looking at it is we just know a lot more now. And the great mystery is why those numbers aren't all zero.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.980]   Like now we know so much about how these things operate and like, they're not that impressive.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.800]   And also why do we don't have, uh, better institutions and better leaders then?
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:49.840]   Yeah. And so, so, so this goes to the thing, which is like, okay, had, had we had the media environment of what we've had between the 1970s and today, if we had that in the thirties and forties
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   or
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:31:18.880]  .
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   It's
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   It's
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   a
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.180]   It's a
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:19.180]   It's a
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:19.280]   feedback loop process.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   in the media environment change reality.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.940]   And so that's what they had at that time. Like, I think we probably most likely would have been just like them.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   Yeah, I think we probably most likely would have been just like them.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.700]   Yeah, I think we probably most likely would have been just like them.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:32:02.720]   So don't you think that our perception and understanding of reality, would you be more and more mediated through large language models now?
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:19.060]   So you said media before. Isn't the LLM going to be the new, what is it? Mainstream media, MSM, it'll be LLM. That would be the source of, uh, I'm sure there's a way to kind of rapidly fine tune of making LLMs real-time.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.100]   That would be the source of, uh, I'm sure there's a way to kind of rapidly fine tune of making LLMs real-time.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.180]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:19.240]   Yeah.

[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:49.280]   Yeah.

[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.120]   For Mark Andreessen's, there's a controversy section
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.700]   for his Wikipedia page.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.960]   In 1993, something happened or something like this.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.760]   Bring it up, that will drive engagement up anyway.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.960]   I mean, look, this gets this whole thing of like,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.700]   so the chat interface has this whole concept
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.720]   of prompt engineering, right?
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.860]   So you have to consider prompts.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.880]   Well, it turns out one of the things
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.540]   that a lot of times they're really good at is writing prompts.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.120]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - And so, like, what if you just outsource?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - And by the way, you can do that, right?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - Yeah.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - And so, like, what if you just outsource?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - Yeah.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - And so, like, what if you just outsource?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   - Yeah.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:58.120]  , and then ask yourself that question to give me the result.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.220]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:58.260]   - And then, as you, exactly to your point,
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.260]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.260]   - there will be these systems are gonna have the ability to be learned
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:58.360]   and updated essentially in real time.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.260]   And so you'll be able to have a pendant or your phone or whatever, watch or whatever.

[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:12.960]  , and then it'll be able to be updated.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.120]  , and then it'll be updated.

[00:36:38.880 --> 00:37:07.800]   building open source, right? You know, you didn't figure out a waste optimize these things. Um, and then, you know, we're just gonna get like overwhelmingly better at generating trading data. We're gonna, you know, bring in like blockchain networks to have like an economic incentive to generate decentralized training data. And so forth and so on. And then basically we're gonna live in a world of open source and there's gonna be a billion LLMs, right. Of every size scale, shape and description. And there might be a few big ones that are like the super genius ones, but like mostly what we'll experience is open source. And that's, you know, that's more like a world of like what we have today with like

[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:37.900]   - Yeah, so the huge advantage of startup's have is they just, there's no sacred cows. There's no historical legacy to protect. There's no need to reconcile your new plan with existing strategy. There's no communication overhead. There's no, you know, big companies are big companies.

[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:37.760]   I was born.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.920]   A small, small child.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.880]   Actually, with this, yeah, let's go there.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.000]   Like, what, what did you, when would you first fall in love with computers?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.120]   Oh, so I hit the generational
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.680]   jackpot.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.520]   And I hit the Gen X.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:50:18.540]  .
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   .
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:48.560]   and.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   And I hit the Gen X.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   and I hit the Gen X.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:48.580]   and I hit the Gen X.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:51:18.600]   and I hit the Gen X. and I hit the Gen X.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   It
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:28.720]  let. I as hotnal
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.580]   of Illinois. I went to
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.580]   school and so the other
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.580]   stroke of luck that I had
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.580]   was I went to Illinois
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.580]   basically right as that money
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.580]   was just like getting dumped
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.580]   on campus. And so the
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.580]   consequence we had on campus
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   and this is like, you know,
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.580]   89, 90, 91. We had like, you
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.580]   know, we were right on the
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   internet backbone. We had
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.580]   like T3 and 45 at the time
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.580]   P3 45 megabit backbone
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.580]   connection, which at the
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.580]   time was, you know, wildly
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.580]   state of the art. We had
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.580]   crazy computers. We had
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.580]   thinking machines, parallel
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.480]   supercomputers. We had
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   Silicon Graphics workstations.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   We had Macintoshes. We had
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   NextCubes all over the
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   place. And so we had a lot
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.580]   of money. And so the
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:08.580]   consequence we had on campus
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:34.620]   we had like every possible
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.620]   kind of computer you could
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   imagine because all this money
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   just fell out of the sky.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   You were living in the future.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   Yeah. So quite literally, it was
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:54.660]   And then they gave every
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.660]   undergrad a computer account and
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.660]   an email address. And the
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   assumption was that you would
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.660]   use the internet for your four
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.660]   years of college. And then you
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.660]   would graduate and stop using
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.660]   it. And that was that, right?
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.660]   Yeah. And you just retire your
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.660]   email address. It wouldn't be
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.660]   relevant anymore because you'd
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:05.660]   go off in the workplace and
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.660]   they don't use email. You'd be
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.660]   back to using tax machines or
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:07.660]   whatever.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   Did you have that sense as
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   Well, like what you said, the
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   back of your head was tickled.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   Like what was your what was
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   exciting to you about this
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   possible world?
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   Well, it's just
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   It's just a little bit of a
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   a bunch of people, but it's
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:30.700]   But I don't think it's a bunch of people that
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:52.740]   a bunch of people. But I think it's a
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:52.740]   a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:57.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:57.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:57.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   I think it's a bunch of people that are in a bunch of them.

[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:27.020]   right. You know, when you're experiencing awe, right? You know, there's like, there's like a, there's a simplicity to it when you're having an honest interaction with somebody, there's an aesthetic, it was like home comes over you because you're actually being fully honest and trying to hide yourself. Right? So there. So it's like this very deep sense of aesthetic. And he would trust that judgment that he had to keep down. Like, even if the engineering teams are saying this is this is too difficult, even if the whatever the finance folks are saying, this is ridiculous, the supply chain, all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:25.140]   I mean, he, you know, you know, he thought very deeply about what it meant for something to be in your hand all day long. Yeah. But for example, he, a, a, here's an interesting design thing. Like he, he never wanted it. It's my understanding is he never wanted an iPhone to have a screen larger than you could reach with your thumb one handed. And so he was actually opposed to the idea of making the phones larger. And I don't know if you have this experience today, but let's say there are certain moments in your day when you might be like only have one hand available and you might want to be on your phone.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:25.460]   Yeah.

[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:53.220]   ... is a
[00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:23.700]  weres into this, like there are very successful companies on both sides of that approach. Right? Like that is a fundamental difference, right, in how to operate and how to build and how to create that you have world class companies operating in both ways. And I don't think the question of like, which is the superior model is anywhere close to being answered. Like, and my suspicion is the answer is do both answers you actually want both. They lead to different outcomes. Software tends to do better with the
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:23.700]   .
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:23.700]   The iterative approach.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:52.460]  ,
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:52.620]   hardware tends to do better with the, you know, sort of wait and make it perfect approach. But again, you can find examples in both directions.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:52.620]   So the jury's still on on that one. So back to Mosaic. So what, it was text based. Tim Berners-Lee.

[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.540]   It was a big bang. Yeah.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.300]   Microsoft was operating on the other.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:19.580]   It was Microsoft was operating on the other.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.760]   It was Microsoft was operating on the other. So Steve, Steve, Apple was running on the Polish.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:45.900]   So Steve, Steve, Apple was running on the Polish. It was perfect. Microsoft famously ran on the other model, which is shift and iterate. And so in the old line in those days was Microsoft version three of every Microsoft product. That's the good one. Right. And so there are you can you can find online Windows one, Windows two. Nobody use them. Actually, the original Windows, the original Microsoft Windows, the Windows are not overlapping. And so you have these very small, very low resolution screens. And then you've had literally, it just didn't work. It wasn't ready yet.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   And then you've had literally, it just didn't work. It wasn't ready yet.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   Well, and Windows 94.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   Well, and Windows 94.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:03:14.620]  , I think was a pretty big leap. Also,
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:24.460]   in retrospect, it felt like it took forever. But that in historical terms, like that was a very fast ramp from even a graphical computer at all on your desk to the iPhone. It was 15 years.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:33.380]   Did you have a sense of what the internet will be as you look into the window on the back? Like, like what you like, there's just a few web pages for now.

I'm looking for my about about, oh, yeah. Um, so, um, so the what's new page, I would literally get up every morning and I would, every afternoon. Um, and I would basically, if you wanted to launch a website, you would email me, um, and I would list it on the most new page. And that was how people discovered the new websites as they were.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   We're

[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.020]   You know, in those days, PCs actually didn't have TCP IP drivers come preinstalled.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.220]   So you had to learn what the TCP IP driver was.
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.520]   You had to buy a modem.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.820]   You had to install driver software.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.820]   I have a comedy routine.

[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:58.020]   And so you had to, you had to look through these practical and then, and then, and then speed performance 14, four modems.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.020]   Right?
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.920]   Like it was like watching, you know, glue dry.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.620]   Um, like.

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:25.440]  ather

[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.260]   Civilization?" Yeah, so those days it was all around crime and terrorism.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:42.760]   So those arguments happened, you know, but there was no sense yet of the internet having like an effect on politics or because that was it was way too far off.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.460]   But there was an enormous panic at the time around cybercrime.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.080]   There was like enormous panic that like your credit card number would get stolen and you'd use life savings to be drained and
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.280]   then you know criminals were gonna there was oh
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:00.340]   When we started one of the things we did we one of the the Netscape browser was the first widely used piece of consumer software that had strong encryption
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   It was the first widely used piece of consumer software that had strong encryption built in.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   It was the first widely used piece of consumer software that had strong encryption built in.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   It was the first widely used piece of consumer software that had strong encryption built in.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   It was the first widely used piece of consumer software that had strong encryption built in.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:29.760]  , And at that time strong encryption was actually illegal to export out of the US.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   And so we could feel that product in the US we could not export it because it was classified as ammunition. So the Netscape browser was on a restricted list along with the Tomahawk missile as being something that could not be exported so we had to make a second version with deliberately weak encryption to sell overseas with a big logo on the box saying do not trust this which it turns out makes it hard to sell software when it got a big logo that says don't trust it's not trust it.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:35.020]   And then we had to spend five years fighting the US government to get them to basically stop trying to do this. And then we had to spend five years fighting the US government to get them to basically stop trying to do this.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:35.260]   Right.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:50.580]   But because the fear the fear was terrorists are going to use encryption right to like plot you know all these all these all these things. And then you know we responded with well actually we need encryption to be able to secure systems so that the terrorists and criminals can't get into them. So that was anyway that was the that was the 1990 site.
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:59.180]   So can you say something about some of the details of the software engineering challenges required to build these browsers? I mean the engineering challenges required to build these browsers I mean the engineering challenges required to build these browsers I mean the engineering

And of course, the answer is, that's correct. But what you get when you make it text is all of a sudden, well, the big breakthrough was the view source function, right? So the fact that you could look at a web page, you could hit view source, and you could see the HTML, that was how people learned how to make web pages. Right?

[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   You know there's a small number of people who are really good at doing exactly that most people can't and most people are excluded from it and so actually that was where that is where I picked up that idea was was like no no you want you want you want these things to be resilient to error in all kinds and this would drive the purist absolutely crazy like I got attacked on this like a lot because yeah I mean like every time you know all the purists who are like in all this like markup language stuff and formats and codes and all this stuff they would be like you know you can't you're encouraging that behavior because.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   They wanted the browser to give you an effect fault error
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   The browser to give you an effect fault error
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:58.260]   a lot of performance we made that that initial experience for the first few years was pretty painful but but the bet there was actually an economic bet which was basically the demand for
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:58.260]   the performance thing was we gave up a lot of performance we made that that initial experience for the first few years was pretty painful but but the bet there was actually an economic bet which was basically the demand for
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:58.260]  ,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   the web would basically mean that there would be a surge in supply of broadband like we because the question was okay how do you get how do you how do you get the phone companies which are not famous in those days for doing new things at huge cost for like speculative reasons like how do you get them to build up broadband you know spend billions of dollars doing that and you know you could go meet with them and try to talk them into it or you could just have a thing where it's just very clear that's going to be the people love that's going to be better if it's faster and so that that there was a period there and this was this was fraught with some peril but there was a period there and this was this was fraught with some peril but there was a period
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:58.300]  ,
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:58.300]   and we were trying to force the emergence of demand for broadband which is in fact what happened so you have to figure out how to display this text html text so the blue links and the purple links and there's no standards is there standards at that time
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:58.300]   there's no standards is there standards at that time
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:58.300]   there's no standards is there standards at that time well there's like there's implied implied standards right and they you know there's all these kinds of new features they're being added like css with like you know there's all these kinds of new features that are being added like css
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.440]   like css what kind of stuff a browser should be able to support
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   what kind of stuff a browser should be able to support
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.400]   what kind of stuff a browser should be able to support features within languages within javascript and so on
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:04.420]   features within languages within javascript and so on
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.560]   features within languages within javascript and so on but you
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:05.580]   but you
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.640]   but you you bait you're setting standards
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:08.660]   you bait you're setting standards
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.360]   you bait you're setting standards on the fly yeah yourself yeah well to this day
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:12.400]   on the fly yeah yourself yeah well to this day if you
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.840]   on the fly yeah yourself yeah well to this day if you if you create a web page that has no css
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:14.880]   if you create a web page that has no css
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.720]   if you create a web page that has no css stylesheet

[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.840]   stylesheet the browser will render it however it
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:16.860]   the browser will render it however it
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:38.520]   wants to yeah right so this was one of the things there was this idea this
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.240]   wants to yeah right so this was one of the things there was this idea this idea at the time and how these systems were built which a
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   idea at the time and how these systems were built which a
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.780]   idea at the time and how these systems were built which a separation of content from format or separation of yeah
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:41.780]   separation of content from format or separation of yeah
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.680]   separation of content from format or separation of yeah content from appearance and that's still it
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:43.700]   content from appearance and that's still it
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.240]   content from appearance and that's still it people don't really use that anymore because
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   people don't really use that anymore because
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:45.780]   people don't really use that anymore because everybody wants to determine how things look and
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:17:14.700]  , everybody wants to determine how things look and
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:24.480]   Whit
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.860]   even .
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:42.960]   Sh I, I,,,,,,
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.600]  ahl the development of HTML and CSS and how those in interface and
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.360]   JavaScript and this whole Java applet thing.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.800]   Well, the big one, probably JavaScript, CSS was after me. So I didn't,
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.880]   that was not me. But, um, JavaScript was the big JavaScript,
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.920]   maybe was the biggest of the whole thing that was us. Um, and, um,
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.360]   and that was basically a bet. There's a bet on two things. One is that,
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.320]   the world wanted a new front end scripting language. Um,
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.000]   and then the other was we best thought at the time,
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.940]   the world wanted a new backend scripting language. Um, so JavaScript,
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:11.940]   was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:11.940]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:11.940]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:11.940]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:40.660]  , So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:40.680]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:40.700]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a,
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:40.740]   So, um, so it was designed from the beginning to be a front end and back end.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.780]   Exactly. So he wrote JavaScript over a summer. Um, and it, it, I, I mean, I think it is fair,
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:51.020]   it is fair to say now that it's the most widely used language in the world and it seems to only be gaining in,
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.120]   in, um, in its, uh, in its range of adoption.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:00.100]   You know, in the software world, there's quite a few stories of somebody over a weekend or over a week or over a summer
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.800]   writing some of the most, uh, impactful revolutionary pieces of software ever.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.680]   Well, look, that, that should be inspiring. Yes.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:18.160]   around
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:31.140]   thin. And never

[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.920]   If you need the third pizza, you have too many people.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.320]   And I think that's, I think that's, I think it's actually the one piece of rule.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.940]   For the, for the really creative work, I think it's two people, three people.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:01.760]   Well, that's, you see that with certain open source projects, like so much is done by like one or two people.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.340]   It's so incredible.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.300]   And that's why you see that.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.560]   It gives me so much hope about.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   That's why you see that gives me so much hope about.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   That's why you see that gives me so much hope about.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:36.620]   that gives me so much hope about.

[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.820]   So that's rude interruption by me now by way of succession. So that was at the height of the deal making and money and just the fur flying and like craziness. And so yeah, it was just one of those. It was just like, I mean, there's the entire Nescafe thing from start to finish was four years, which was like for one of these companies, just like incredibly fast. You know, it went public 18 months after we got moved. We were founded.

[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:46.600]   um and it's really important to kind of talk about the sort of very nature of what intelligence is and
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.660]   Fortunately, we have a we have a predecessor to machine intelligence, which is human intelligence
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:55.680]   And we've got you know observations and theories over thousands of years for what?
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:24.060]  , intelligence is in the hands of humans and what intelligence is right?

[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:52.900]   and so and this is where you get it.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.800]   And again, if you just look at the history of millenarian cults, this is where you get
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.700]   the people's temple and everybody killing themselves in the jungle.
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:02.220]   And this is where you get Charles Manson and you know, sending in to kill, kill the pigs.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.860]   Like this is the problem with these.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.940]   They have a very hard time to run the line at actual violence.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.600]   And I think, I think in this case, there's there, I mean, they're already calling for
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.560]   it like today and you know, where this goes from here as they get more worked up.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.340]   Like I think it's like really concerning.
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.340]   Okay.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:22.940]   But that's kind of the extremes, you know, the extremes of anything I was concerning.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:52.980]   I think it's also possible to kind of believe that AI has a very high likelihood of killing
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:52.980]   and therefore we should maybe consider slowing development or regulating.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:52.980]   So not violence or any of these kinds of things, but saying like, all right, let's, let's take a pause here. You know, your biological weapons, nuclear weapons, like whoa, this is like serious stuff. We should be careful. So it is possible to kind of have a more rational response, right?
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:49:23.020]  , like, you know, we should be careful. So it is possible to kind of have a more rational response, right?

It feels like you could have models, machine learning, that, like, kind of, they don't perfectly predict the future, but they they help you do something, because there's pandemics that are like, meh, they don't really do much harm. And there's pandemics, you can imagine them, they could do a huge amount of harm, like they can kill a lot of people. So you probably have some
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:16.860]   you probably have some kind of data drive.

[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:17.120]   That's when you need to shut down the data center.

[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:26.620]   This is not anything.

[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:31.060]   ran only well a
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.000]   just bugs in the code
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:42.380]   accidentally, you know, force you the results in the bombing of like large civilian areas.
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:42.780]   Okay.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:49.280]   And to, to a degree that's not possible, um, in the, in the current, um, military strategies.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:49.620]   I don't know.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:53.480]   Well, actually we've been doing a lot of mass bombings of cities for a very long time.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.420]   And a lot of civilians died.
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:56.280]   And a lot of civilians died.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.080]   And if you watch the documentary, the fog of war McNamara, it spends a big part of it talking about the fire bombing.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:01.080]   Корre.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:01.080]   It's a big part of it talking about the fire bombing.

[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:07.120]   better
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:28.680]   scary. I ab'm,,,,
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:38.480]   get
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:39.960]   Wha But I is and
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:45.640]   activ
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:56.360]   receivers, and, and, .,,,,,,, read something
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:02.200]   or what I think are fundamentally suspicious reasons.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.900]   - Emotional, psychological reasons.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:05.400]   - I think it's very clear that the machine's gonna do
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:06.660]   a better job making that decision,
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:10.100]   'cause humans making that decision are godawful.
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:10.940]   Just terrible.
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.780]   - Yeah.
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:13.860]   - Right, and so, so yeah, so this is the thing.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:16.400]   And then let's get to the, can I, one more sleight of hand?
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.240]   - Yes, please.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.080]   - Okay.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.140]   - Please, I'm a magician, you could say.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:20.980]   - One more sleight of hand.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:23.100]   These things are gonna be so smart, right,
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:24.400]   that they're gonna be able to destroy the world
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.380]   and wreak havoc and do all this stuff and plan
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:28.080]   and do all this stuff and evade us and have all their
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.980]   secret things and their secret factories and all this stuff
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:29.980]   Кор, I'm sorry.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:29.980]   - Okay.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:03:00.020]   - Okay.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:00.020]   - Okay.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:00.020]   - Okay.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:00.020]   - Okay. - Okay.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:00.020]   - Okay. - Okay.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:11.020]   After
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.720]   and I think it's going to be super genius level that humans aren't going to be able to counter.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:26.800]   I don't know how you get the one without the other. Is it possible to be super intelligent without being super wise? Well, again, you're back to that. I mean, then you're back to a classic autistic computer, right? Like you're back to just like a blind rule follower. I've got this like core is the paperclip thing. I've got this core rule. I'm just going to follow it to the end of the earth. And it's like, well, but everything you're going to be doing to execute that rule is going to be super genius level that humans aren't going to be able to counter.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:26.240]   is a little bit of a spicy take. So Robert Oppenheimer famously said now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds as he witnessed the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16 1945. And you write an interesting historical perspective, quote, recall that John von Neumann responded to Robert, Robert Oppenheimer's famous hand-wringing about the role of creating nuclear weapons, which you note helped end World War Two and prevent World War Three.

[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:56.240]   with the AI, you can't do it. You can't get it down the scale that we think is allowable. Are we going to invade? Right? And you have figures on the AIX risk side who are advocating, you know, potentially up to nuclear strikes to prevent, you know, this kind of thing. And so here you get into this thing. And again, you know, you could maybe say this is, you know, you could even say this is what good, bad or indifferent or whatever. But like, here's the comparison of nukes. The comparison of nukes is very dangerous because one is just nukes for just a while, although we can come back to nuclear power. But the other thing was like with nukes, you could control plutonium, right? You could track plutonium. It was like hard to come by.

[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:26.260]   You could track plutonium. It was like hard to come by. AI is just math and code, right? And it's in like math textbooks and it's like there are YouTube videos that teach you how to build it. And like there's open, there's already open source. There's a 40 billion parameter model running around already called Falcon online that anybody can download. And so, okay, you walk down the logic path that says we need to have guardrails on this and you find yourself in an authoritarian totalitarian regime of thought control and machine control that would be so brutal that you would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:26.260]  , you would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:26.260]  , you would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:56.280]  , you would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:56.280]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:56.280]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:56.280]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:56.280]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:56.280]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   You would have destroyed the society that you're trying to protect.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   The beliefs of some select group of people.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   The beliefs of some select group of people.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   Then it's just your beliefs.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   The number of people you're lying to, smaller and smaller, as that group becomes more and more powerful.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   Okay. But that just speaks to the people that censor are usually the assholes and the assholes get richer.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   I wonder if it's possible to do without that for AI.
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   One way to ask this question is do you think the baseline models, the baseline foundation models
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   do you think the baseline models, the baseline foundation models
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   are not the right way to do it?
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   Do you think the baseline models are not the right way to do it?
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   Do you think the baseline models are not the right way to do it?
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   Do you think the baseline models are not the right to do it?
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:26.300]   So you're not the right to do it.
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:52.600]  ;
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.300]   and so it's actually yes and so it is actually a question I think there's still a question which is can big American companies actually feel generative AI at all or is the liability actually going to just ultimately you know generate the AI or is it going to be a problem for the company?
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:25.300]   I think there's still a question which is can big American companies actually feel generative AI at all or is the liability actually going to just ultimately you know generate the AI or is it going to be a problem for the company?

[02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:58.040]   just
[02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:20.900]   it and which
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:52.480]   renders you a Manhattan project for biological defense right and let's build a is and let's have like broad spectrum vaccines where like we're insulated from every pathogen right and that was what the interesting thing is because of software. A kid in his basement teenager could build like a system that defends against like the worst of the worst I mean and to me defense is super exciting. It's like if you believe in the good of human nature for the most
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:52.480]   people want to do good.
[02:31:52.500 --> 02:32:21.220]   To be the savior of humanity is really exciting. Yeah.
[02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:21.220]   Not okay. That's a dramatic snow, but I can help people to help people. Yeah. Okay. What about just to jump around? What about the risk of will AI lead to crippling inequality? You know, because we're kind of saying everybody's life will become better. Is it possible that the risk get richer here? Yeah. So this actually ironically goes back to Marxism. So because this is the cause of the core claim of Marxism right basically was that the owners of the world are not going to be able to do anything.
[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:30.260]   even
[02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:48.780]   knew,,,,
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:33:00.520]   the way that the self-interested owner of the machines makes the most money is by providing the production capability in the form of products and services to the most people, the most customers as possible.
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:01.200]   Right.
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:06.100]   The largest, and it is one of the funny things where every CEO knows this intuitively, and yet it's like hard to explain from the outside.
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:10.840]   The, the way you make the most money in any business is by selling to the largest market you can possibly get to.
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:13.980]   The largest market you can possibly get to is everybody on the planet.
[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:18.860]   And so every large company does is everything that it can to drive down prices, to be able to get
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:18.860]   to be able to get to.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:18.860]   The largest market you can possibly get to is everybody on the planet.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:18.860]   The largest market you can possibly get to is everybody on the planet.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:18.860]   The largest market you can possibly get to is everybody on the planet.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:18.860]   The largest market you can possibly get to is everybody on the planet.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:47.780]  , to be able to get to everybody on the planet.
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:47.840]   And that happened with everything from electricity.
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:47.860]   It happened with telephones.
[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:47.960]   It happened with radio.
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:48.060]   It happened with automobiles.
[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:48.120]   It happened with the PCs.
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:48.200]   It happened with the internet.
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:48.260]   It happened with mobile broadband.
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:48.300]   It's happened by the way with Coca-cola.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:34:17.340]   It's happened by the way with the internet. And you know, it's it's like chat GPT and Bing are not like, you know, Exxon and Boeing there, you know, your uncle and your nephew, right? It's just like it's either freely available online or it's available for 20 bucks a month or something. But, you know, these things went, this, this technology went mass market immediately. And so, look, the owners of the means of production, whoever does this, as you mentioned, he's truly no questions. There are people who are going to get really rich doing this, producing these things, but they're going to get really rich by taking this technology to the broadest possible market. So, yes, they'll get rich, but they'll get rich. And then, I think, you know, it's not necessarily going to be the largest market.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:17.640]   So, you can only be able to buy.
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:18.320]   It's only by everybody on the planet.
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:48.340]  .
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:35:18.360]  , you know, it's not necessarily going to be the largest market.
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:18.360]   Yeah, I think it's going to be the largest market.
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:18.360]   Yeah, I think it's going to be the largest market.

[03:08:34.380 --> 03:08:36.960]   I mean, look, he drives resentment.
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:39.720]   Like he is a magnet for resentment.
[03:08:39.720 --> 03:08:43.080]   Like his critics are the most miserable,
[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:44.960]   resentful people in the world.
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:48.720]   Like it's almost a perfect match of like the most idealized,
[03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:49.700]   you know, technologists,
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:49.700]   and the most idealized, you know,
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:49.700]   It's almost a perfect match of like the most idealized,

[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   I don't know the answer to that.
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   I think the meaning of,
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   I think the meaning of,
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   I don't know the answer to that.

[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   I think the meaning of,
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   the closest I get to it is what I said about satisfaction. So it's basically like, okay, we were given what we have. Like, we should basically do our best. What's the role of love in that mix? I mean, like, what's the point of life if you're, yeah, without love, like, yeah. So love is a big part of that satisfaction. And look, like, taking care of people is like a wonderful thing. Like, you know, mentality, you know, there are
[03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:49.740]   a

[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:27.720]  berger: Capitalism kind of enables that, encourages that. David Friedman says there's only three ways to get somebody to do something for somebody else. Love, money and force.
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:46.180]   Love and money are better. Yeah, that's a good ordering. I think we should bet on those. Try love first if that doesn't work, then money and then force. Well don't even try that one. Mark you're an incredible person. I've been a huge fan. I'm glad I've
