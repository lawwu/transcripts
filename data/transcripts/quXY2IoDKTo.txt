[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   we're starting to see it really catch up
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.460]   in lots of other countries
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460]   as we export the American way of life all over the place.
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.640]   Like, if you go to Japan,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.740]   the childhood obesity rate is, like, 5%.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.740]   Here, it's, like, 5x that.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.700]   Japan's a high-income country,
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.380]   but they have a completely different food system.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.020]   They have a completely different relationship
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.740]   with nature and respect for nature.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.840]   It's a very different culture.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.480]   So when America exports their food to other countries
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.160]   and the way that we live,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920]   the countries seem to be getting sicker.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.300]   But we are uniquely one of the sickest countries in the world,
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.920]   because I feel like we are the epicenter
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.800]   of "technological progress,"
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.240]   and we're moving away from nature
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.940]   at one of the fastest paces, I think, of any country.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.940]   And so because of that,
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.140]   we're sort of the leading edge of sickness,
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.480]   but we do see it happening all over the world.
