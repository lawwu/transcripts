[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900]   We end the week talking about providence.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.160]   We started the week talking about providence
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.120]   and explaining the pains of life to children.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   Today a question from a grieving young woman,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.120]   a new believer and a listener to the podcast
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.600]   who is now struggling to process
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.320]   a very deep trial in her life.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.080]   We don't have her name, but here's her email.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.160]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for APJ.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.600]   I write because last year someone very close to me
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.200]   was assaulted and murdered.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.440]   At the time of the tragedy, I had not devoted
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.560]   my life to Christ.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800]   The pastor at the funeral said, quote,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.240]   "I don't think it was God's plan for this to happen,"
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.800]   end quote.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200]   I remember feeling so lost and angry.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520]   I gave my life to Christ a few months later,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.380]   but I still don't understand why my loved one
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.400]   would be murdered if God is omnipotent.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   Does God allow sin to roam unchecked?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.720]   Does the Bible say anything about God allowing
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   such awful sin to happen and why?
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.680]   I am a new Christian with a lot to learn.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.040]   Oh, how I wish I knew your name
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.940]   so that I could speak to you very personally and directly.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.600]   But let's do the best we can.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   I am very sorry that you lost this close friend of yours,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.720]   especially in such a brutal way.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.280]   But it's good for me to know this because I can tell
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.720]   that your question is not theoretical.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.480]   Lots of people ask this question in a very antagonistic
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.180]   and theoretical way, but yours is very personal,
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.120]   very urgent, and that's the kind of question I like,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600]   and I think it's the kind of question
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.900]   that God is very willing to hear.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.160]   It's difficult for me to know what the pastor
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.400]   at your friend's funeral meant when he said,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.200]   "I don't think it was God's plan for this to happen."
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Maybe all he meant was that God never does anything wrong
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.040]   and never sins against anyone.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.720]   But it's one thing to say that God never does wrong,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.800]   and it's a very different thing to say
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.360]   that God does not govern or oversee or direct
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.040]   or control the wrong that happens in this world.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.940]   And if that's what the pastor meant,
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.280]   that God doesn't do that, I think he's mistaken
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   because the Bible teaches from cover to cover
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.380]   that God does in fact govern all the details of the world,
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.880]   including the bad things that happen to us
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.320]   and to our friends.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.800]   That in fact, I would argue, is what it means
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.360]   for God to be God.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   I say that because Isaiah 46, nine says,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.320]   "I am God, and there is no other.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.600]   I am God, and there's none like me,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.340]   declaring the end from the beginning
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.160]   and from ancient times, things not yet done,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.600]   saying, 'My counsel shall stand.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.840]   I will accomplish all my purpose.'"
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.040]   So God's counsel, God's wisdom, God's purpose
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.080]   always comes to pass.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.240]   That's what it means to be God.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.680]   Not the devil, not nature, not fate,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.440]   not chance, not sinful man.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   Nobody and nothing can thwart the plan of God.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.860]   Job 42, verse two says, "I know that you, God,
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.160]   that you can do all things,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.120]   and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.840]   And the apostle Paul says in Ephesians 1, 11,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   "God works all things according to the counsel of his will."
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.160]   All things includes the largest things,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.800]   like the rise and fall of nations,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   and the tiniest things,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.840]   like the fall of a bird out of a tree,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.120]   or like the roll of the dice,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   for example, Daniel 2, 21 says,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.160]   "He removes kings and he sets up kings."
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   And Jesus said in Matthew 1, 29,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.360]   "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.160]   And not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.900]   apart from your father."
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.400]   And Proverbs 16, 33 says, "The lot is cast in the lap,"
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   which is an old-fashioned way of saying
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   the dice are thrown on the table,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.600]   "but it's every decision is from the Lord."
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.840]   In other words, from the tiniest,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.280]   most insignificant happening
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.360]   to the largest global happenings,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.320]   God governs all things.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   Alongside that absolute sovereignty of God over all things,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.560]   we need to embrace the teaching of Scripture
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.320]   that God is always just, always good.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.440]   For example, beautiful statement in Deuteronomy 32, 4,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.700]   "This rock," referring to God,
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.520]   "This rock, his way is perfect,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.500]   for all his ways are justice,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.000]   a God of faithfulness,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and without iniquity, just and upright is he."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.100]   Beautiful.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.940]   And Psalm 34, 8 says,
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.720]   "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.520]   Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him."
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.800]   He is good, he is wise, he's faithful,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.340]   he's just, he's upright.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.340]   There's no iniquity in him, no darkness in him at all.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.280]   So we naturally ask,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.920]   this is why I said your question was so good
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.900]   and right at the beginning,
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.040]   we naturally ask,
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.800]   why does God permit so much suffering and evil
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.000]   if in fact he's in control?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.680]   Now, the Bible gives numerous answers to that question.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.800]   If you go to Desiring God's website
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.120]   and just type in the search line,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.320]   what are the purposes for suffering?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.920]   You will find several articles right at the top of the list
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.960]   that point to those answers.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.240]   But let me mention two of them,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.340]   two answers just briefly.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.820]   One of God's purposes for suffering
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   is to show all of us the horror of sin.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.300]   Suffering entered the world when mankind fell into sin.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.860]   Genesis 3.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.860]   Suffering is a trumpet blast to all humanity
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.580]   that just like pain is an outrage to the human body,
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.280]   so sin is an outrage against God's character and glory.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.960]   The horrors of physical suffering
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   are an echo of the horrors of humanity's belittling God
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.560]   by our disobedience and unbelief.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.200]   But maybe most important for you as a newer Christian
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.480]   is to focus your attention on the death of Jesus.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.260]   I assume that not long ago, because of what you said,
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.260]   God opened your eyes to see the death of Jesus on the cross
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.620]   for your sins as a compelling and true and beautiful reality.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:43.020]   And you believed and you are saved today from guilt
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.780]   and from wrath and hell and meaninglessness
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.780]   because Jesus suffered on the cross in your place.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   Now, put the death of Jesus together with God's sovereignty.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.080]   That's what Acts 4.27.28 do.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.480]   The early church prayed in those verses like this,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.220]   "In this city, Jerusalem, there were gathered together
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.060]   "against your holy servant Jesus,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.400]   "whom you anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.740]   "along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.440]   "to do whatever your hand and your plan
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.600]   "had predestined to take place."
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   So Herod, Pilate, Gentile soldiers, Jewish mobs,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.680]   all of them combined to kill Jesus.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.640]   The murder of Jesus was like the murder of your friend,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.760]   only worse because Jesus is the very son of God.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.800]   And the Bible says that the sins of his murderers,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   Herod, Pilate, soldiers, mobs,
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.680]   their sins in murdering Jesus were predestined
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   and planned by God.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   And he did this, God did this without himself sinning.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.480]   He can govern, rule, oversee, control,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.340]   guide the evils of the world without being evil.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.600]   If God had not planned the death of his son,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.400]   neither your sins nor mine would be forgiven.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.360]   God orchestrated the worst sins that ever happened
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.040]   in the murder of his son so that you and I
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.320]   and millions of those who believe on Christ
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   would be saved from destruction and given eternal joy.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.480]   Romans 5, 8 says, "God shows his love for us
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.760]   "in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.320]   Which means that we simply could not know
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   the depths of God's love without the death of Christ.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.000]   And there would be no death of Christ
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   without sin and suffering and the sovereignty of God.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.040]   So when you feel that you can't understand
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   why God does what he does, let your heart rest here.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.800]   The worst suffering and the deepest sovereignty
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.560]   meet at the point of greatest love, the cross of Christ.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.600]   So rest there.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   - Sobering, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.200]   And thank you for joining us today on such a weighty question.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.880]   We address a lot of heavy topics here.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.600]   If you have one, you can go to
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.720]   desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn to ask it.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.320]   And speaking of heavy questions,
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   a man with a disabled friend
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   writes in with a trio of questions next time.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.960]   Number one, should we pray for healing
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.880]   for those with physical and cognitive disabilities
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.680]   such as Down syndrome?
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.880]   Number two, how should we encourage such a friend
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.400]   with the truth that they are made in God's image?
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.380]   And number three, will individuals in heaven
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.040]   retain some remnant of their disability?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.420]   That's an interesting trio of questions
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.520]   all up on Monday when we return.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.560]   Have a great weekend.
