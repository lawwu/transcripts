[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.800]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the second chapter, reading verses 46 and 47.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.200]   Now let me remind you again of this context. It is such an important statement, this. Let
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.580]   me read again from verse 41 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.000]   Then they that gladly received his word were baptized; and the same day there were added
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.320]   unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles'
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.000]   doctrine and fellowship, in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.400]   and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.960]   and had all things common, and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.200]   all men as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness, and with singleness of heart,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.840]   praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   such as should be said.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.740]   Now we are looking at all this once more because it is, as I have been at pains to point out,
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.320]   the great fundamental statement with regard to the nature of the Christian Church, and
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.400]   indeed with regard to the nature of the Christian life, as to what it is that makes anybody
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.120]   a Christian. Again, let me say why I am doing this. This is what I regard as the most urgent
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.720]   and the most important thing in the world this evening. There is nothing more important
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.960]   than that we should know the message of this gospel. Why? Well, because it is the only
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.320]   thing that can teach us how to live, the only thing that can teach us how to die, the only
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.680]   thing that can prepare us for eternity. That is not to disparage other things. Other things
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.480]   are necessary. Political action and so on are necessary. But the great question that
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.360]   arises is this. Why do you need political action? Why do you need the acts of Parliament?
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.800]   Why do you need policemen? Why do we need all these things? And the answer is because
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.600]   of the troubles that we find in life in this world. You have to preserve order, and that
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.320]   is because of what we are told here in the scriptures. That is why I claim for this message
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   that it is more important than any other. It is the only message that explains the cause
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   of our ills and troubles. The others try to deal with them, but they are not aware of
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.640]   the fundamental cause. It is only the biblical view of men made in the image of God, form,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.360]   rebellious, into sin, it is that alone which really explains the state of the world and
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.840]   the condition of humanity. But not only does it alone explain the cause of our troubles,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.040]   it is the only solution to our troubles. Now that is something that should be evident to
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.560]   everybody. The world is still in trouble in spite of all the efforts of the philosophers
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.520]   and the politicians and all others who are trying to deal with the problems of men in
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.000]   this world. They don't succeed. But here is something that does succeed when men and
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   women try it and give it an opportunity. And that is why I say that this is more important
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.080]   than anything else. It is the only way to understand life, the only way to understand
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   history, the only way to prepare with confidence for an unknown future.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.560]   So I am arguing that the most important thing for us in this world is to know exactly what
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.920]   this message is and what it means to be a Christian. And I am arguing, secondly, that
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.600]   that is not a matter of opinion. Now here is the central error of modern thinking, surely,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.440]   that modern men imagine that he has the right to decide for himself anew and afresh what
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.600]   Christianity is, what the Church is, and what the message is. Now this is not only presumption,
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.800]   it is unutterable folly, because we are dealing here with something that is historical. Here
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.760]   is Poem Sunday. Why is Poem Sunday recognized? Why do people call it Poem Sunday? Well, the
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.520]   answer is that it is connected with certain facts of history. You see, this message is
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   not a philosophy. It is not just a teaching amidst many other teachings. Here is something
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.320]   which is based upon facts. The fact of Poem Sunday. This person, Jesus of Nazareth, riding
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.400]   on the foal of an ass, and the people crowding round him and shouting, "Hosanna!" Now
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   this is a fact of history. And then the trial and the scourging and the death upon the cross
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.120]   on Good Friday, and so on, followed by the resurrection. Now these are facts. And the
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   Church came into being as a result of these. So if we really want to know what Christianity
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.640]   is and what the Christian Church is, I say there is only one thing to do in common honesty,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.060]   and that is to go back to the record. What do we know about Christianity apart from this?
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.560]   Oh, I can have my ideas, you can have your ideas, and one is as good as another, and
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.880]   you'll never be sure of anything. But if you want to know what Christianity is, how
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.440]   the Church began, what she taught and preached, what happened as a result of that, well you've
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   got to come back to this. And that is why this second chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.560]   of the Apostles is so vital and so crucial in all these matters. Let clever men say what
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:17.120]   they will. And if we wanted to be so, many of us could be clever. But the point is not
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.200]   to be clever, but to teach men and women something that really can make a difference to them
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   in this life and in this world, the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.520]   And here it is. And you see it comes to this. On that day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, a tremendous
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.360]   thing happened. The disciples of our Lord and others with them were gathered together
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.720]   in an upper room, and suddenly they heard a sound as of a rushing mighty wind. And they
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other tongues. This was a phenomenon,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.440]   and it gathered the crowd together. People couldn't understand this. They looked at them
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.280]   and said, "These men are filled with new wine. They're drunk. These men are talking
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.880]   in our own languages, and they don't know them. What is this?" And Peter got up and
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:18.560]   preached a sermon. It consisted mainly of an exposition of Old Testament prophecies.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.720]   He went on to explain to them who this Jesus was, what his death on the cross meant, how
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.840]   he'd risen from the dead, and had proved it by sending down this gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.680]   And on he went preaching. And it had a tremendous effect. We are told that as they heard this,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.800]   they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.920]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" And Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.280]   every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.480]   the gift of the Holy Ghost." With many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.560]   yourselves from this untoward generation." And we are told that they that gladly received
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.600]   this word were baptized, and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   souls. Very well, here's the Christian church, here's Christianity. What did they do? Well,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.840]   we are told that they continued steadfastly, every day after day, in the apostles' doctrine
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   and fellowship and breaking of bread and of prayer. This is Christianity, the true thing,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.640]   not some formal dead service which you attend against your will and just doing your duty,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   not something mixed up with the state and with politics, but people meeting together
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.520]   to worship God in Christ and to receive his power, to be instructed in this teaching,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.720]   to enjoy the fellowship of like minds, to remember his death upon the cross in the breaking of bread
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.640]   and drinking of wine, and in prayers and petitions to him. That's it, that's Christianity, that is
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.520]   the Christian church, something live and vigorous. And then we saw last Sunday night that it's
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:10.320]   characterized by great gladness. Here they are, continuing daily with one accord in the temple
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:19.920]   and breaking bread from house to house. They did eat their meat with gladness, and we saw the
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.640]   grounds of that gladness that should ever characterize the true Christian, a joy unspeakable
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.320]   and full of glory. The Christian is a man who has got life within him and understanding that
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.520]   enables him to face the darkest and the blackest with triumph. He's enabled to look at it all and
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:48.080]   say, "Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.640]   not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:06.940]   are eternal." Now then, my friends, here's the question. Have we got that gladness? Are we
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:16.040]   enabled to face the future in that way and in that kind of spirit? Have we this principle within us
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.720]   which makes us more than conquerors over everything that is set against us? That is Christianity,
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:29.280]   and nothing else is. But now we look tonight at still another thing we are told about these people,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:37.080]   and everything we are told here is of the greatest possible significance and importance. These words
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.440]   and expressions with respect to these people were not used at random. These are recorded
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.960]   because they're indicted by the Holy Spirit himself, and these are the marks and the characteristics of
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.600]   the true Christian. So we are interested in what we are told about these people, and not merely
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.760]   that we may have a true and an accurate historical understanding of what Christianity is, but in
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.280]   order that we may test ourselves also, and discover whether we've got this. Because this is what makes
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   a man a Christian. The moment a man becomes a Christian, these are the ways in which he shows
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:21.260]   it. He's a man who's absolutely changed. He's a new man, separated from the world, belonging to
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.160]   this new company, and he shows this new life that is in him in various ways and manners. And this is
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.600]   one of them, and one of the most interesting. They did eat their meat not only with gladness,
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:44.520]   but also with singleness of heart. Now why is this, you think, recorded in particular? Well,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:52.400]   it's the most important statement, this, and we must examine it together. It means, first and
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:01.680]   foremost, of course, this, that they were all of them of one mind, that they were experiencing a
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:08.760]   very wonderful unity, singleness of heart. Their hearts, as it were, were melted into one another.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.240]   It is a description, then, of the company the society of these believing people looked at in
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:24.760]   general. Our Lord had prayed that they might be one, even as he and his father are one. And here
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.440]   they were giving expression to this. They were different people, different temperaments,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.360]   different backgrounds, different upbringing, differing in almost every conceivable way and
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.560]   manner, yet they're all melted into one. This extraordinary unity, we've already gone into
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:48.120]   this. In verse 42, they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching, in the apostles' fellowship,
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.880]   in the breaking of bread, and of prayer. It was an amazing thing how all these differing people
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   came together in this way, and they enjoyed this. Now, the New Testament emphasizes that great and
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.600]   wonderful truth right away through from beginning to end. The apostle Paul was particularly proud
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.000]   of this thing. He was called to be the apostle to the Gentiles, though he'd been a very narrow
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.040]   and a rabid Jew in his old life. He now gets up and says, "There is neither Jew nor Gentile,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female, all are one in Christ Jesus." And it's
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.160]   the most amazing thing that the world has ever known. The Christian Church, when she functions
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.120]   truly as the Church, is the greatest phenomenon that the world has ever known. It's the only
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:44.640]   thing that ever can unite people. The world is disunited tonight. We talk about our various
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.240]   curtains, and you see groups and classes and divisions. You don't get them in the Church.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:59.360]   All are one, singleness of heart, melted into one in Christ Jesus. This is an astounding thing.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:06.520]   And here you see, on the day of Pentecost, we are given this picture of what the world is going to
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.400]   be eventually, when Christ comes back to reign and conquers all his enemies and sets up his
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:21.560]   glorious kingdom. Singleness of heart. There is a day coming when war shall cease, not as the result
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.320]   of men's organizations, of course not. They'll never come to anything. There will be wars and
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   rumors of wars. The politicians and the foolish idealists will go on saying that they're going
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   to produce a state in which there'll be no war. They never will. But Christ will put an end to
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:48.680]   war when he returns, and he will reign from shore to shore. And there shall be peace like a river,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:56.120]   and righteousness like the waves of the sea over the whole universe and cosmos. Now, here it is,
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:03.640]   you see, an embryo. And it's going to be thus worldwide. Well now, it means that. With gladness
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:11.720]   and with singleness of heart. But the question that arises is, why were they thus manifesting
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:19.600]   this great unity? And the answer, of course, is that they manifested this singleness of heart
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:29.280]   because each one of them separately have got this single heart. Now, that's the thing to which we
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.360]   must give our attention tonight. What does it mean? Here are a body of men and women, they're one.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.400]   Why are they one? Well, they're one in a sense, if you like, because each one of them has been
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   made a unit, has been unified. This is one of the most remarkable things about this gospel.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.560]   It is one of the greatest characteristics of the Christian life. Did you notice how our Lord put
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.360]   it in the Sermon on the Mount, a portion of which we read at the beginning out of the sixth chapter
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:06.160]   of the gospel according to St. Matthew? Listen, he says, "The light of the body is the eye. Therefore,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:13.920]   if thine eye be single, thy whole body also shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   thy whole body also shall be full of darkness." Now, there's this same expression. If thine eye
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.880]   be single, what does he mean by that? Well, here is the great principle that I want to put before
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:34.480]   you. That the main effect of the Christian gospel, when a man believes it upon him,
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:45.960]   is to unify his life, to make him single. Mankind, apart from Christ and outside the life of God,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.760]   has got double vision, doesn't see things properly, doesn't see them unified,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.080]   doesn't see them steadily, doesn't see them as a whole. And what Christianity does is to get rid
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:07.920]   of the complications and to produce an essential simplicity. Let me expound this to you. This is
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   something that I can show you in general as well as in particular in the case of the individual.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:22.360]   Now, when I say I can show it to you in general, I mean something like this. That the effect of
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:31.680]   Christianity always is to simplify, to make single instead of multiple. Single is the opposite,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:39.000]   if you like, of multiple. And the gospel simplifies. It produces this single eye.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   Now, this I can show you even historically. I can show it to you even in the history of
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   the Christian church. Here is this lyrical picture of the church at the beginning. Oh,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.960]   just a handful of people. They went at first to the temple, of course, because they'd been brought
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.640]   up to do so, and it was available for them to have their meetings. But, you see, that was
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.000]   supplemented by their meeting together in one another's houses, breaking bread from house to
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.880]   house. And you read in the epistles about the house, the church in the house of Priscilla
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.920]   and Aquila and so on. You know, that's primitive Christianity. We, of course, inevitably tend to
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.960]   think of it as some great institution with great buildings and people dressed up in various robes
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:37.840]   and pomp and ceremony and processions. Oh, how different it's all become to what you find here
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.600]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. How has it ever developed into this?
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.880]   There's only one answer. Man's done all that. Man always makes everything complicated. That's
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.360]   one of the tragedies of the hour, isn't it? We've got great problems, but then in trying to solve
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.840]   our problems, we create fresh problems. Haven't you noticed how government is becoming increasingly
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.280]   complicated? I'm old enough to see the extraordinary development in complication. Because you've set
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.080]   up one office, then you have to set up another to look after that one, and another one to look
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.320]   after that one, and so you get a bureaucracy. And we don't know where we are. Everything becomes
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.640]   increasingly complicated. And that has happened in the life of the Christian church. The whole
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.240]   thing has become almost unrecognizable in terms of what you read of in this second chapter of the
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.560]   book of the Acts of the Apostles. So, when you come to the end of the Middle Ages, you see the
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:43.760]   Roman Catholic Church. Pomp and ceremony, the Pope claiming political power as well as religious
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.240]   power. He becomes a state, and it's almost impossible to discover what Christianity is.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.480]   It had almost become lost. And the people simply went to this priest, and he went to another. And
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:01.800]   no man knew God, and nobody had assurance of salvation, and everybody was relying upon payments
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.760]   and this and that. The whole thing had become so involved and complicated that the common men had
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:15.480]   no idea what Christianity meant. And then came the Protestant Reformation. What did that do? Oh,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.040]   what it did was to go back to the New Testament. It just went back to the book of the Acts of the
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:30.360]   Apostles. And the whole thing immediately became much simpler. It was all simplified. The gospel
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:37.800]   always does this. It says you don't need all this, that's man. God's way is the way of the
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:45.280]   singleness of heart, the single eye, the simplicity that ever characterizes the true gospel. It gets
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:54.720]   rid of complications. Now, there it is, as I say, in general and in the history of the church. Every
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.680]   reformation in the history of the church has always simplified the life of the church. The
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   Protestant Reformation did it. Puritanism took it further. Puritanism said even the Reformation
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.680]   hasn't gone far enough. You've carried too much of Rome with you. The thing is simple. It's plain.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.520]   Where do you find all these things in the New Testament? No, no, they must go. Puritanism,
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:23.280]   purifying, making it single. And in the same way, the great evangelical awakening of 200 years ago
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:29.240]   did exactly the same thing. And so it has always been. But look at it in the case of the individual.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:40.360]   Now here is this great contention of the New Testament gospel, that it makes life simple and
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:56.440]   single. The unbeliever's life is always a complicated life. Sin always introduces complications. It's
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.320]   all there in the picture in the third chapter of the book of Genesis. What a simple life Adam and
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.880]   Eve were living before they fell and rebelled against God. What a delightfully simple life it
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:18.120]   was. It was called paradise. There was no need of government there. There was no need of all this
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.200]   great machinery to deal with problems and difficulties, because they were non-existent.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:31.040]   When man lived life as he was meant to live it, in correspondence with God, it was an essentially
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:37.280]   simple life. But the moment man sins, he's in trouble. He sinned against God. And now he hears
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.440]   the voice of God, he has to run and hide himself. He doesn't know what to do. He can't face God.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.920]   He needs protection. Already the complications have come. And then, of course, because of his
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.800]   sin, he's driven out of the garden. He's now got to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. You
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.600]   read about Cain starting to build cities, and there you get the beginning of civilization,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:07.960]   with all the complications. And on and on it is continued. Sin always makes life complicated and
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:15.840]   difficult. And it does it, of course, for this reason, that it divides up our lives into sections.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:25.600]   We haven't any unifying principle, as we are by nature. Man is a mass of contradictions. Don't
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   you see that in the life of today? Man is the most contradictory creature on the face of the earth.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:41.320]   On one side, brilliant in his achievements, and on the other side, so despicable often in his
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:49.040]   living and in his life. Mastering the elements, unable to master himself. Arriving at knowledge
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:57.080]   and understanding of great mysteries, away up in the heavens, but often living like a beast and
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:03.600]   worse. What's the matter with men? There are these warring elements and factions within him. There
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:11.160]   are always these contradictions. There is no unifying principle in men. Now we all know this
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:19.240]   by nature. We've all found it out from experience. You see, it's this whole problem that the Apostle
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:27.120]   Paul puts so perfectly once and forever in Romans 7. This duality, call it what you like, that's in
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.880]   men. The will is present with me, but how to perform I know not. With my mind I do admire
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:39.240]   the law of God, but I find another law in my member dragging me down. Now this is the whole
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.680]   problem of life, and this is the whole tragedy of life. A man doesn't know himself, he doesn't
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:50.160]   understand himself, so that Paul there has to say, "I find myself doing this, but it's no longer I,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.440]   in a sense, that I'm doing it, because I want to be like that, but I find myself like this. What is
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.720]   it? It isn't I. Well, I don't know where I am." You see, you read that seventh chapter of the
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.560]   epistle to the Romans, and you'll find the most profound psychological analysis of men without
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   God and without Christ that's ever been written. He says, "I am at least two I's." There's an I
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.480]   that wants this, there's the other I that wants that, and he seems to be outside both of them,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.000]   in a sense. And he looks on at these warring elements in his members, as it were, and he
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.160]   doesn't know what to do about it, and cries out in despair, saying, "Oh, wretched men that I am,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:37.760]   who shall deliver me?" Now, that is, you see, the effect of sin. And what it means is complications,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:48.480]   divisions, warring elements. But the moment a man believes this gospel, this element of singleness
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:58.000]   comes in. Singleness of heart, order is brought into the life, a principle is introduced which
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:07.360]   governs everything. Life is made a whole. Now, the psalmist looked forward in prophecy,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.880]   and he saw something of this. You'll find it in the 84th Psalm. In our authorized translation,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.960]   it puts it, "In whose heart are the ways of them." But the better translation is this,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:25.600]   "In whose heart are ways." The thing that happens to a man when he becomes a Christian is that a
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.760]   way is put into his life. There is a unifying principle. There is a singleness that enters,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.160]   the complications begin to disappear, and there is a great principle. That's what happened to
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.040]   these people, and it happened to all of them. So they met together with singleness of heart.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:54.120]   How did it happen? Well, let me show you. This is something, I say, that is done to us by the
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   Lord Jesus Christ. He came to do it. He said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.640]   might have it more abundantly." As they are, he said, they're only existing. They don't know what
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:16.200]   life is. They're nothing but a conglomeration of factions. They don't know what it is to live.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   They haven't got this unified view of life, and life itself which is unified. I've come that they
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:32.200]   might have it. And what I want to show you in terms of this great message is how our Lord does
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:39.720]   give us this principle of unity and of singleness. Look at it like this. He does it, first of all,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:49.400]   with our minds. And here is the first step always. How does the Christian's life, I ask,
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   become simple and single? Well, here's the first thing. This principle is introduced into the mind.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:05.640]   The first thing a man discovers when he becomes a Christian, it is that there is only one thing
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:17.760]   that finally and ultimately matters, and that is his soul. Now let me put it in this form. Look at
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.120]   the world today. Look at the thinking people. Read the more intelligent journals and the books that
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:28.800]   come out dealing with the problem of society. I'm not here to say a word against them. These things
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.360]   are absolutely essential. Government and order are essential. They are ordained of God. The
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:41.720]   powers that be are ordained of God. But let's make no mistake here at this point. These things
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:49.880]   were never ordained by God to solve the problem. They were only ordained to keep the problem within
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:57.120]   limits. There is only one thing that can solve the problem. It is this message. How does he do it? He
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:04.720]   does it like this. He tells us that there's only one thing to examine. There is only one thing to
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:11.000]   investigate. Now the trouble with a man who's not a Christian is that he doesn't know that. So he
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.760]   begins to examine this problem piecemeal. He says, "One says this is it, I must examine that. The
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.440]   other says it's this, I must examine that." And here they are setting up commissions of inquiries,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.560]   setting up subcommittees and more subcommittees, investigating, examining, and never arriving
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:34.120]   even at an understanding of the problem, leave alone a solution to the problem. Why? This is
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.840]   where the gospel is so different from every other teaching in the world tonight. It comes
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:46.120]   immediately to the center and says, "There is only one thing that matters. It is your soul."
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:57.000]   Oh, I've often quoted that word of Shakespeare, which is the perfect introduction, it seems to me,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.600]   to the gospel at this point. "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   that we are underlings. And what is it that's wrong in me? Oh, it is that I haven't realized
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:18.200]   the soul." Here is the key in the center of everything. Now I read to you that statement
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.920]   just now about our Lord in the house of Martha and Mary in order that I might illustrate this
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.200]   thing to you. You remember the story. Our Lord went to that certain village and a certain woman
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:36.000]   named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.160]   feet and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him and said,
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.760]   "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:52.440]   she help me." And Jesus answered and said unto her, "And here is the essence of the gospel."
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:00.400]   And this is what he says to any troubled, unhappy, defeated soul in this congregation tonight. "Martha,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:13.120]   Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary hath
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:20.360]   chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her." What's he mean by that? Well,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.160]   he says this, "Martha, the trouble with you is that you're distracted. You are divided up. You're
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.260]   trying to do this and that. You've invited me into your house, but now you're concerned about
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:34.680]   giving me a meal instead of listening to what I've got to say. Martha, you're divided up. Mary's got
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:44.120]   the single idea. One thing is needful, and one thing only." Oh, our Lord was constantly saying
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   this. Listen to him on another occasion. "What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:58.680]   world and lose his own soul?" You see, this is the tragedy of the 20th century, the age of
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.840]   encyclopedias. What knowledgeable people we are. Oh, how ignorant were our forefathers. They didn't
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.200]   know what we know, all our vast scientific knowledge, all the learning we've got, and the
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.840]   education, and the books, and the lectures, on the television, and the wireless. What amazing
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.600]   people we are. All the information that we possess. Why do we fail them? What's the matter
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:28.800]   with us? And that's the answer. "What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world of
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:37.200]   knowledge, and wealth, and everything else, and lose his own soul?" You see, our Lord was
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   emphasizing this from the beginning there in the Sermon on the Mount. He says, "Enter ye in at the
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.840]   straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction. And many
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.480]   there be that go in there." Now, that's not only talking about morals, that's talking about thought
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:33:00.000]   also. And the point I'm making is this, that if you want to know a single-eyed life, if you want
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.680]   this essential simplicity that characterizes Christianity, you start with the mind. And in
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   this way, you enter in at the straight gate. What does that mean? Well, it means this in the first
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:20.640]   instance. That as our Lord put it again, "Except ye be converted, and become as little children,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:28.040]   ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven." Or as the Apostle Paul puts it, "You see
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.960]   your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   are called." If you want to learn how to live, says Christ, come to the straight gate. The straight
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.560]   gate is this, that you recognize there's nothing that matters but the soul. Forget your philosophy
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.400]   for the moment. Forget all your learning and all the lore of the centuries, and all that you regard
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.280]   as wonderful. It won't help you here, my friend. You can be brilliant in philosophy, you can be
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.880]   wonderful in music, and in art, and in many other respects. But what is the condition of your soul?
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.400]   Here is the one thing that matters, the single eye. So you see, at the very beginning, our Lord
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:20.160]   simplifies everything by bringing us to see that there's only one thing that we really need be
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.120]   concerned about. And that is what happened to these people listening to Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   Oh, they'd had their interest, and they were talking about them, but listening to these men,
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.120]   they come to the realization there's only one thing that matters. They have said away with
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.680]   him, "Crucify him," about the Son of God. They've defied God, and because they've defied God,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.040]   they're under his wrath. And if they die like this, they go to hell. They say, "Nothing matters.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.520]   What's it matter what I think about the Roman government, or about my wealth or learning? What
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.240]   does it matter when I'm on my deathbed? Nothing will matter to me except God, and myself, and the
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:02.120]   relationship between us." That's the way in which he simplifies everything and produces this singleness
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:15.920]   of heart. Now, my dear friends, this is still the truth in these matters. The world is busy
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:23.440]   with its learning and its understanding, but there is still only one question that we really
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:33.280]   need to face, and here it is. How can I stand before God? How can a man be just with God?
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:40.520]   Because that's what I've got to be. The world and its kingdoms are passing away, change and decay,
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:47.200]   and all around I see. Every day I get a day older, and I know that it's coming inevitably. I shall be
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   alone before God. Here's the fundamental question. Here's the only question at the beginning. How can
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:04.840]   a man be just with God? You see, the gospel simplifies the problem, doesn't it? You see,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:11.280]   it tells us at the very beginning that all our problems come out of that one question. All the
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.880]   teeming problems in the universe tonight have arisen directly because man has lost the face
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:25.160]   of God and is a sinner in his sight and is under condemnation. Do you know that it all comes to
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.800]   that? Alcoholics, anonymous, marriage counsel, all these things that are being set up to deal
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.280]   with this problem and that, and the other, and the other, and the other. You know, if man was
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:42.960]   only right with God, he wouldn't need any one of them. All the problems would be solved. Why?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:54.040]   Because they all stem from this evil that is in man, from his wrong relationship to God. That's
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:00.920]   how the gospel simplifies everything. That is why it talks about singleness of eye and singleness
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:06.800]   of heart, this great principle of unification. It comes right to the one and only problem and
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.080]   says, "How have you faced that? Have you solved that? How do you stand with God? How can your
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:18.680]   sins be forgiven? So, here's the question." Now then, these people have come to that. But thank
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:26.200]   God it didn't stop at merely isolating the one question that matters, isolating the one great
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:34.240]   problem of all the problems. A Christian is not only a man who has been given to see the one
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:43.480]   problem that confronts him. Thank God he's found the one and only answer. And this is the thing in
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.160]   which, if I may say so, I rejoice at times more than in anything else. The Christian is a man who
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:56.880]   is no longer seeking. He's a man who's found. The Christian is no longer a man who is swayed
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:03.040]   by the different views and ideas and schools of thought. He's no longer waiting on tiptoe for a
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.560]   book that's to be published next week, which he's assured by the publishers is going to give him
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:16.120]   great help. He says, "I've got it. I've already found it." He's not a seeker any longer. He's a
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:26.960]   man who's found. He has found the answer to the one great question in this one blessed person.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:39.280]   There is no other answer. He has found this answer, and it's enough. How can a man be just
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:46.480]   with God? Can a man, by seeking, find out God? Can a man, with all the genius of his ability and all
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:54.600]   the learning of the ages, can he really find God? The Apostle gives the answer, "When the world by
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.960]   wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:09.000]   believe." All the brilliance of Greece and of Rome couldn't find God. They were idol worshippers,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.480]   and their cities were cluttered with pimples. But here comes a man with a simple message and
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:19.480]   says, "No, no, it can't be done. Men, by seeking, cannot find out God. The world has tried and has
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:27.840]   failed." But listen, there's only one way to know God. "No man hath seen God at any time. The only
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him." There has stood one in this
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.200]   world called Jesus of Nazareth, a simple man, apparently, and a carpenter, without learning,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.360]   and didn't belong to the schools. And he stood before men and he said, "He who hath seen me,
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:53.040]   hath seen the Father come unto me." He says, "I am the answer. I am the way, the truth,
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:00.080]   and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." And these people had seen that and had
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.600]   believed it. And the seeking, and the questing, and the striving, and the searching had come to
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:12.680]   an end. The answer is in Christ. He's the Son of God. He's the one who brings us to God. Simply
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.720]   believe in Him and He will give you the light and the knowledge. Didn't He say, "I am the light of
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:25.120]   the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:31.880]   My dear friend, have you discovered this? Have you got singleness of mind? Or are you still
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:39.760]   looking, searching, reading about other religions, reading this latest cult? Oh what an unhappy and
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:46.640]   miserable life it is, this seeking, searching, and never finding. Come to Christ. Repent. Be
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.400]   baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You'll have an answer. You'll have a singleness
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:59.080]   of mind and of understanding. And this knowledge will be a central controlling principle in your
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:06.960]   whole outlook upon life. What a wonderful thing I think I say it is, to have a view of life that
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:14.080]   can take in all the contingencies, to have this great view of man in this world with all your
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:23.920]   questions rarely answered. The singleness that comes to the mind of a believer in the Lord Jesus
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.600]   Christ. But let me hurry on to point out how this same singleness affects his heart also.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:39.200]   Oh what a blessed thing this is. Listen to it. "They continuing daily with one accord in the
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:45.680]   temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   of heart." Oh blessed singleness and peace of heart. The end to the old restlessness. What a
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:03.640]   terrible thing it is. We've all known something about this, haven't we? You remember that famous,
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:13.160]   often quoted statement of Augustine, and it can never be repeated too frequently. "Thou hast made
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:23.480]   us for thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee." The whole universe
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:30.440]   can't satisfy us. You can have wealth and abundance. You can have possessions. You can
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:38.440]   have learning. It won't give you peace and rest of heart. Listen to a great man writing a hymn
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:45.280]   about this, a hymn translated by John Wesley, a hymn by Ter Stegen. "Thou hidden love of God,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:54.880]   whose height, whose depth unfathomed no man knows. I see from far thy beauteous light thinly. I sigh
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:04.400]   for thy repose. My heart is pained, nor can it be at rest till it finds rest in thee. 'Tis mercy
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:11.160]   all that thou hast brought my mind to seek her peace in thee. Yet while I seek but find thee not,
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:25.600]   no peace my wandering soul shall see. Oh, when shall all my wanderings end, and all my steps
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:33.760]   to thee will tend?" That's it, isn't it? And haven't you known something about that, my dear friend?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:42.120]   This restlessness. The world can't satisfy us. Why not? Well, because God has put eternity in
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:48.840]   our heart. Thank God a man's too big and too great to be satisfied by anything in this world. That is
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.320]   why those sociologists and others who say that if a man's given a good house that he'd be made
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:59.440]   happy are insulting human nature. Man cannot be satisfied with a house. Every man deserves a
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.640]   decent house, but you can have a mansion and be miserable, and a heart is restless, longing,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.520]   yearning for something that is ever eluding you, and you'll never find it. The whole world is
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.920]   looking for the quiet heart, the rest, the peace that the world can neither give nor ever take
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:24.640]   away when it's truly given by Christ. But you see, when men and women come to Christ, they get
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:32.120]   singleness of heart. The restlessness goes. Listen to Philip Doddridge putting it in his own
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:43.720]   experience. "Now rest, my long-divided heart, fixed on this blissful center. Rest, with ashes who
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:52.640]   had grudged apart when called on angels' bread to feast." This is it. This is what has happened to
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:59.120]   these people. That old restlessness, that feeling you wanted something else, there's always a fly
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:05.080]   in the ointment, there's no final satisfaction, there's no real peace. They've got it. They've
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:15.280]   got complete satisfaction. They've got this singleness of heart, which means also that they
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:21.560]   were no longer divided within themselves as to what they ultimately wanted. Now our Lord,
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:27.160]   as expounded that so fully in the Sermon on the Mount, I have nothing to do but to quote him. You
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:33.560]   remember what he said? "You cannot serve God and mammon." And that's the whole trouble with most
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.360]   people, with all people indeed who are not in Christ. A divided heart. Got a certain amount
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.880]   of feeling that they must serve God and yet they want to serve mammon. And here they are worrying,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.000]   "What shall we eat? What shall we drink? Wherewithal shall we be clothed? What's going to happen
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.440]   tomorrow?" And your heart is divided and distracted and you can't sleep. And you have to take more
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.280]   sleeping pills and then you need a stimulus to enable you to live the next day. You're all
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.800]   divided. You don't know what you want. You want to travel. You feel travel is going to give you
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.920]   something. But you travel the universe and still your heart is as restless as it was before you
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:17.840]   left home. It's all because the heart is lusting after various things. It's divided on itself. It
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:23.000]   doesn't know what it needs. It doesn't know what it wants. And there is this conflict,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.200]   God and mammon, heaven and earth, time and eternity. Which shall I live for? And we're
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.240]   all a mass of contradictions by nature. We don't know which is most important. All that is done
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:45.520]   away with in Christ. Or let me put it in this form. The heart is restless and divided because
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:53.640]   of self. The ultimate cause of all this heart restlessness is self and all that comes out of
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:59.680]   it. Setting myself up, but that means somebody else does, there's conflict. Jealousy, envy,
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:08.440]   or despising. Hating all the conflicts of life and the restlessness, ambition, desire. Oh what
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.240]   a terrible business it is. And the heart is divided against itself. But the moment a man
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:22.640]   comes to Christ, he gets a single heart. How does it happen? Oh it all happens in Christ.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:34.080]   He's able to say, object of my first desire, Jesus crucified for me. Or listen to Charles
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.320]   Wesley putting the same thing. Here's a man like ourselves, who knew all about the restlessness
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.160]   and the division and the conflict and the seeking and the searching. He's told you all about it in
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.320]   his journals. Buy them and read them and you'll see a man in the division seeking for truth,
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:00.240]   seeking for heart rest and peace, seeking a firm ground on which to place his feet. And on and on
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:08.600]   he went like that for years, but at last, in a very simple way, he just believed this message.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:23.800]   And he's able to say this, thou O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find. And he meant
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   what he said. It's all there. Everything is there. There is nothing further that a man can desire.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:41.120]   It is all in Christ. He'll satisfy your every need. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:49.360]   whatever it is. He is with you in every respect and in every circumstance. And so Charles Wesley
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:56.080]   is able to say that out of an honest heart. Once a man really knows Christ and his salvation,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:04.120]   he is given a final satisfaction. Let the world rob him, let the world mock him,
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:10.160]   let the world spit upon him as it spat upon his master. It makes no difference to him.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:18.840]   Man may trouble and distress me, 'twill but drive me to thy breast. Doesn't matter. Life
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:28.760]   with trials hard may press me, 'twill but drive me to thy breast. It may rob me, I say, of everything,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:36.600]   but Christ remains. So the Apostle Paul is able to say, I am persuaded that neither death,
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.640]   nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.840]   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:54.920]   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And there he is, an old man in prison in Rome, and he's heard
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.640]   a rumour that the Emperor Nero has decided to put him to death any day that may come. And how does
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.240]   he write about it all to the Philippians? He writes like this. He says, you know, it's all right,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:13.400]   don't be worried about me, for to me to live is Christ. Christ is life to me. And he's as much
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:19.000]   life to me in this prison cell as he was when I was at freedom out and about, travelling across
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.520]   continents preaching his glorious gospel. To me to live is Christ. I have all and abound to die
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:35.920]   is gain, for it means to be with Christ, which is far better. Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:43.000]   more than all in thee I find. Have you found him? That's what had happened to these early Christians.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:54.600]   They ate their meat with gladness and with singleness of heart. Christ was there enthroned
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   and giving them full and complete satisfaction. And for me to close, let me point out how the
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:08.280]   same thing applies also in the realm of the will. Here's the trouble again, isn't it? What's our aim?
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:18.440]   What's our motive? What's our object and purpose in life? Oh, the millions of people who are unhappy
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:25.720]   tonight because they've got the wrong aim, to get on, to cut a great figure, to leave your name on
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:33.600]   the pages of history. Ah, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. There is nothing that so
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:43.800]   troubles men as ambition, muddle, confusion in the realm of motives and of ideas. But the moment
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:50.680]   a man believes in Christ, he has the singleness in the will, as well as in his mind, as well as in
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:52:00.560]   his heart. A Christian is a man who has one great desire. It is to know him and the power of his
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.480]   resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death, if by any
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:13.200]   means I might attain unto the resurrection from amongst the dead. That was the apostle's sole
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:21.680]   ambition, that I might know him. And a man who knows anything about him gets consumed by this
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:30.520]   great passion. How sins and of was it who said I have one passion, it is he, it is he alone. Oh,
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:38.240]   to know him who is life indeed, who loved me that he came from heaven and suffered all that he
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.680]   suffered in this world, even the death of the cross, that I might live. Oh, that I might know
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:51.080]   him. You have one ambition, and here it is, to know him, and not only to know him more and more,
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:58.680]   but to live to his glory. And once you are imbued with this ambition, the whole of your life is
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:04.360]   revolutionized in that it becomes simple. Listen to Ter Stegen again, as translated by John Wesley,
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:12.080]   "Is there a thing beneath the sun that strives with thee my heart to share? Ah, tear it thence,
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:20.600]   and reign alone, the Lord of every motion there. Then shall my heart from earth be free when it
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:32.920]   hath found repose in thee. Take my will and make it thine, it shall be no longer mine." That's the
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:38.840]   prayer of the Christian. He's got singleness in the realm of the will. He's got one idea,
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:46.120]   one desire, one motive, and that is to live to his praise who has died for him and opened the
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:51.240]   gateway of heaven to him. The whole of life becomes simple. The program becomes a simple
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.960]   one. John Wesley said, "I have become a man of one book," and in a sense that becomes true of
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:00.640]   every Christian. Have you discovered that all the books of the world can't help you unless you know
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:06.080]   this? It will bring you to one book, it will bring you to one person, to one death, to one
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.960]   resurrection, to one hope, all in Christ Jesus. Here is the explanation of the singleness of the
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:24.680]   Christian. So he's able to say again, "Oh, for a heart to praise my God, a heart from sin set free,
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:36.160]   a heart that always feels the blood so freely shed for me." Well, there it is, my friends,
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:48.080]   and we leave it at that for this evening. But there remains the question, have you got this
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:57.360]   singleness? Have you this singleness in your mind? Have you this singleness in your heart?
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:06.440]   Have you this singleness in your will? The world hasn't got it. The world knows nothing about it.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:14.040]   The world is typified by Martha, cumbered, distracted, rushing about, fussing, and missing
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.720]   everything. The Lord of Glory is there, and there she is, busy. He hasn't come to eat,
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:31.920]   he's come to teach. Come, have you sat at his feet as Mary did? Is this your prayer tonight?
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:42.720]   "Oh, that I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet. Be this my happy choice,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:53.360]   my only care, delight, and bliss, my joy, my heaven and earth. Be this to hear the bridegroom's voice."
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:56:01.280]   It really comes to that. Are you rushing about madly, intellectually, emotionally,
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   and in the realm of will, seeking satisfactions which you never find, seeking knowledge you
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:14.680]   can't attain unto, and divided, and distracted, and weary, and tired? Listen to the invitation
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:21.360]   of this blessed gospel. Emulate the example of the people who gladly received the word as
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:27.320]   preached on the day of Pentecost by the Apostle Peter. Listen to the Lord's own words as spoken
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:39.800]   to Martha, "One thing is needful, and one only." Have you realized that there's only one problem
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:48.000]   for all of us initially? It is the problem of our immortal souls and their relationship to God.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:57.440]   What's the state of your soul? Can you live? Can you die? Can you face God in the judgment? Oh,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:05.960]   my dear friend, stop rushing about. Stop reading. Stop arguing. Take your seat with Mary at the
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:15.520]   Master's feet. Listen to him, and he will say to you tonight, "Come unto me, all you that labor
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:31.880]   under heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Learn of me. Take my yoke upon you, and you'll
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:55.000]   find your life transformed, to spend eternity in his glorious presence." Amen.
