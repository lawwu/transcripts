[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.060]   - Hello again, and thank you for listening
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.200]   to Ask Pastor John with longtime pastor
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.680]   and author, John Piper.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.900]   While Jesus was never ashamed to tell his disciples
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260]   or his potential disciples to liquidate all of their assets
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.360]   and to give away all of their cash first,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.040]   giving rise to today's question
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.360]   from a college student named Noah.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.960]   Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.020]   This program has encouraged and strengthened me
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.440]   for over a year now, whether I'm at the gym
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.040]   or walking back from class or folding my laundry.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920]   I am truly blessed by the wisdom you share.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.240]   Thank you.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   I am a Christian hedonist at Stanford University,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.300]   finishing my third year of undergrad work.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360]   I just finished reading the chapter
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.520]   that you wrote, Pastor John, on money in Desiring God,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240]   the book, and I am faced with this question.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800]   Why should I not give all or a significant portion
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   of what I earned to the Lord?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.580]   Most teaching I've heard on money and tithing
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.400]   have pretty much said give and give generously.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.160]   I wanna give as generously as possible
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.040]   and invest eternally, but at what point
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   does my giving to the Lord become irresponsible?
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   Right now, I don't earn very much,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.000]   but I also don't need very much.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   Of the $10,000 I earn, I only spend about $2,000 per year,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.840]   and after giving over 20% to God and investing the rest,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   I still can't help but feel like my reward
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   would be greater in heaven if I gave more,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   which I'd happily do.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.600]   The problem is I think I would feel the same way
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   after giving 30% or 50% or 80% to God too,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.000]   but is that a problem?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.480]   Wasn't the widow commended for giving everything?
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.360]   Are we told not to worry about what we will eat
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.200]   or drink or wear?
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240]   Jesus said sell your possessions, give to the needy,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.520]   provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.560]   And you said in Desiring God, the book,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.320]   Jesus is not against investment.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.880]   He is against bad investment,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.760]   namely setting our hearts on the comforts and securities
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.980]   that money can afford in this world.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.000]   Money is to be invested for eternal yields in heaven.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.640]   So if God has given me a generous heart
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.000]   and blesses me beyond my necessity,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.200]   why should I not give away everything?
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   - Well, I'm not gonna tell Noah not to give away everything.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.280]   I don't know what God may be calling him to do.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.680]   Jesus certainly called on the rich young ruler
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080]   to give away everything.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.800]   In Luke 18.22, Jesus said to the rich young man,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.720]   "One thing you still lack, sell all that you have
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   and distribute to the poor
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.500]   and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me."
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.440]   And as Noah observed, he commended the widow.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.600]   Jesus, it says, many rich people were putting
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.440]   in large sums of money as Jesus was watching in the temple.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.800]   And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.720]   which make a penny and he called his disciples to him
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.840]   and said, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.400]   has put in more than all those who are contributing
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.680]   to the offering box for they contributed
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.940]   out of their abundance.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.940]   But she out of her poverty has put in everything,
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.480]   everything that she had, all she had to live on."
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   I don't know what measure of sacrifice financially
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   Jesus may call Noah or anyone to undergo.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.200]   I'm not assuming he shouldn't give away everything.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.740]   But here's what I will do.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.640]   I will say that I cannot biblically tell Noah
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   this is his duty, this is his biblical obligation
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.160]   from the Lord or that it is the biblical obligation
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.040]   or duty of Christians in general
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.880]   to give away all that they have.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   There are reasons and I'll just list several.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   Number one, Jesus and the apostles never made
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.880]   giving away all our possessions a duty
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   for all followers of Christ.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.440]   The command to the rich young ruler
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.420]   was not a command to all.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.260]   Number two, Zacchaeus was commended
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.800]   for giving away half of his riches to the poor.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.320]   Behold, the half of my goods I give to the poor
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.080]   and if I have defrauded anyone of anything,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.680]   I restore it fourfold.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.720]   And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.840]   to this house since he also is a son of Abraham."
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.000]   In other words, he saw in that kind of generosity,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.520]   namely 50% plus, salvation has come.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.240]   He's showing he's really saved.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.920]   Third, Barnabas was admired as a son of encouragement
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.580]   in the early church and when the believers
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.560]   were selling their lands and houses together,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.240]   money for the poor, it says, "Thus Joseph,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.800]   who was called Barnabas," which means son of encouragement,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.120]   "A Levite, a native of Cyprus, sold a field
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.200]   that belonged to him and brought the money
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.600]   and laid it at the apostles' feet."
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   So one field, no doubt a very significant gift,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.100]   but not everything.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.140]   Number four, when Paul was taking up a collection
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.320]   for the poor in Jerusalem among the churches,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.960]   he said to the Corinthians, this is 1 Corinthians 16, 1,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   "Now concerning the collection for the saints,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.960]   as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also you.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.120]   On the first day of the week, each of you
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.560]   is to put something aside and store it up
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.240]   as he may prosper so that there will be no collecting
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.420]   when I come."
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.040]   So the idea seems to be in proportion as you prosper,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.400]   put more aside, not everything, just more
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.280]   for those who earn more, less for those who earn less,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.980]   put something aside.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.040]   Number five, Paul says, "Aspire to live quietly."
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.720]   This is 1 Thessalonians 4.10, "Aspire to live quietly
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.320]   and to mind your own affairs and to work with your own hands
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.000]   as we instructed you so that you may walk properly
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.520]   before outsiders and be dependent on no one."
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   So it seems that in the ordinary life of the church,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.200]   day in and day out in the world,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.860]   we should at least seek to have a stream of income
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.900]   that keeps us from lazy mooching.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.740]   That's what he says,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.260]   so that you will be dependent on no one, work.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.540]   So that means you need to have enough to pay your bills.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.940]   You don't give everything away.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.540]   You invest and create a life that keeps you
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.380]   from being dependent on others.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.860]   Number six, Paul said, "Let the thief no longer steal,
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.660]   but let him labor doing honest work with his own hands
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.660]   so that he may have something to share with anyone in need."
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.940]   Ephesians 4.28.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.700]   So three options, you can steal, that's option one.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.060]   Option two, you can work to have, that's option two.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.900]   Or you can work to have to give, that's option three.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.300]   The assumption is that as the money passes through our hands
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.900]   into productive uses, whether for the poor
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.820]   or invested in some way to help society,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.020]   we are not dependent on others.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.180]   Enough of our income is supporting us
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.820]   so that we can give and give and give
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.180]   as well as not being moochers off of others.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.580]   And by the way, that does not mean it is a sin
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.500]   for churches to support missionaries.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.580]   Paul, that's another whole, ask Pastor John,
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.180]   we can do how Paul in fact took money from churches
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.700]   in order to make it free for others.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.940]   But that's a parenthesis and I'll just stop there.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.600]   Number seven, Paul speaks of his own pattern
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.280]   of partially foregoing the right of support, quote,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.900]   "By toiling night and day that we might not be a burden
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.900]   to any of you.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.900]   It was not because we do not have the right,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.500]   but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.460]   For even when we were with you, we gave you this command,
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.860]   if anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.860]   For we hear that some among you are walking in idleness,
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.440]   not busy at work, but busy bodies.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.020]   Now such persons we command and encourage
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.380]   in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.700]   and to earn their own living."
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.220]   So the normal pattern in the early church
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   and in Christianity, day-to-day life is make a living,
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.020]   pay your own way and turn your whole life into ministry.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.300]   Now lots of other passages could be brought in
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   to show that owning nothing and giving away everything
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.920]   was not in the New Testament the way Jesus
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.940]   and the apostles conceived
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.740]   of the ongoing corporate Christian life.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.460]   And I'll just mention two things in closing
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.380]   that might give Noah some guidance against this background.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.180]   Number one, don't just think of percentages
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.060]   for how much you give away.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.180]   Think of concrete people, concrete needs
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.600]   as you live your life and as you see
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.800]   if your heart really loves people.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.920]   Here's what I mean.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   The good Samaritan was commended that he stopped
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.760]   and he helped the wounded man on the road.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.400]   He had some wine to give him.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.920]   He had a donkey that he would let him ride.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.120]   He had money for paying for his lodging.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.840]   And Jesus didn't question, "Hey, why do you have a donkey?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.400]   Why do you have wine?
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.360]   Why do you have money?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.560]   You're supposed to give everything away."
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.680]   The point was, do you love the person in front of you
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.760]   at cost to yourself?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.400]   So shift your way of thinking, not merely to think,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.000]   oh, how much, what percentage can I get rid of,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.880]   but rather do the people I deal with and that I'm aware of,
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.920]   do I love them as I ought with my resources?
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.880]   And here's the second thing I would say finally.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.320]   Remember that all of your money is God's,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.920]   not just what you quote, "Give to the Lord."
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.800]   This means that we should think of every expenditure
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.520]   in a kingdom advancing way, not just what we give away.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.720]   It is all Christ's.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.960]   He owns you, he owns it.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.880]   And every single thing you spend and what you give
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.960]   is ministry and should be designed to magnify Christ.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.200]   So Noah, I'm with you in the struggle,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.080]   just as much now at age 73 as I was when I was 23.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.120]   So let's pray for each other
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   that we not be taken captive by our possessions.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.640]   - Amen, same here.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.080]   The really good example here, Pastor John,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.720]   of explaining a truth by synthesizing
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   a lot of other texts around it.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.240]   Thank you for that model.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.680]   Thanks for the question, Noah.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   Blessings on your studies.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.320]   Thanks for listening on campus.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.760]   And as always, thank you for listening wherever you are,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.600]   whatever you're doing.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.720]   Thank you for listening.

[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.240]   On Monday, we look at the glorious text in Galatians 2.20.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.800]   What does it mean that Christ is alive in me?
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.120]   And what does that mean for the stewardship of this life?
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.720]   Is this life really my life anymore?
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.680]   We look at that on Monday.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhart.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.640]   You have a great weekend.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.200]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
