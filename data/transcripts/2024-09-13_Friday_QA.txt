[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.300]   - We go now to a written question
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.100]   from a listener who writes in and says, Joshua,
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.780]   I can't call in today, but would love
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.060]   if you would address my question this week.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.820]   I have three young kids and we're going to be moving
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.860]   into a rental in a new city for the next year.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.340]   We're evaluating renting a single family house
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380]   with a yard that they can be set out to play by themselves
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.740]   versus a luxury apartment with no yard, but a pool.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.700]   We value lots of outdoor time,
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.060]   but the appeal of no maintenance for a year is strong.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.900]   Can you talk about the various home types
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.940]   and setups you've had as you've moved around the world
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660]   over the past few years, what the pros and cons are
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.860]   and what you'd recommend based on your experiences?
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.340]   And absolutely I will.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.020]   First, I want to point out that a yard is not a yard
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.020]   is not a yard.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.380]   And so the first thing to clarify will be
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.580]   if we're comparing two properties,
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.940]   one that has a yard and one that doesn't have a yard,
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.220]   let's start by understanding what is the definition of yard.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.920]   In general, children are not that attracted
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280]   to a small postage stamp patch of grass.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.000]   That does not have a lot of attraction.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.080]   On the whole, life as a parent is usually
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.500]   a little bit easier as a parent in the suburbs
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.140]   than it is in the middle of the city
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.720]   because of having an outdoor space.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.680]   It's nice, however, primarily for the verbal separation
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.140]   where you can send the children outside
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.240]   where they can be loud, they can yell, they can scream,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.620]   they can get their wiggles out
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.960]   and you don't have to be the one listening to all of that.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.080]   They can just do it outside
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.920]   where they're not bothering anybody.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.480]   But if there's just an empty piece of grass,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.300]   that in and of itself is not very attractive for children.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.920]   I myself think of it like fish.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.060]   Now I'm not a fisherman,
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.160]   but what I understand about fishing
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.900]   is that if you have a big empty lake,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.480]   you don't just go out in the middle of the lake
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.400]   and plop a line down and expect to catch anything.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.860]   The place where the fish hang out
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.760]   is wherever there's texture,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.360]   or as the permaculture designers would say,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.680]   wherever there's edge,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.720]   wherever there's some kind of change.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.020]   And so in order to have a yard
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.780]   that's attractive to children,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.600]   there needs to be a significant amount
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080]   of texture available in it.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.180]   What is an example of what I'm talking about?
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.840]   Well, ordinarily you would have something
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.300]   like a play structure.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.200]   And this is why if you go across suburbia,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.040]   you'll see many yards and houses
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.620]   that have installed some kind of basic play structure
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.480]   with a couple of swings, a monkey bars,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   a place to climb, things like that.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.760]   And these structures are a good start,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   but they probably last for about 20 minutes or so
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.400]   in terms of overall engagement,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.120]   because they're hard to use imaginatively.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   They're usually kind of bare.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.960]   They're just some basic stuff
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.560]   and children don't wanna swing for an hour straight.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.600]   So it's a good start to be able to put
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   some kind of play structure in, but not sufficient.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.040]   Now, if you have a yard that is a jungle,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   an absolute jungle,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.860]   now you've got some probabilities
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.400]   for it really being engaging to children for a long time.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   Ideally, we would have trees,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.980]   we would have bushes you can hide under,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.820]   you can crawl under,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.600]   we'd have places you can dig a hole,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.920]   you'd have all kinds of vines,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.200]   and again, places you can go up and down
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   and under and through.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940]   Ideally, for the sake of children,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.080]   there would be a whole bunch of garbage in the backyard,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.120]   some pallets and some cardboard
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.280]   and random pieces of rusty tin
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   that they can either cut themselves and get tetanus
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.440]   or alternatively build an imaginative fort,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.720]   something like that.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.880]   So this is where children are really engaged
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.440]   is when they're surrounded by all kinds of stuff,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.320]   all kinds of opportunities where they can build,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   they can change.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.640]   And usually, this doesn't exist in suburbia
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.240]   because the postage stamp yard is,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   that kind of yard,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.400]   the kind of yard that's actually engaging to children
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.680]   doesn't actually appeal,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.800]   doesn't appeal to parents.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   We want a nice, beautifully manicured backyard
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.640]   with strips in the grass from our lawnmower.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   And if we're gonna have a child's play area,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.760]   it should be a play area
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   with a small mulched patch in the side
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.400]   and that's where the children can go.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.840]   And that's just not very appealing to children.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.080]   And so my observation is that most yards in suburbia
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.360]   due to keeping up appearances,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.960]   especially if it's a rented house,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.840]   they're just not actually gonna be
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.560]   that engaging to children.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   Is it possible, of course,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.060]   that you can go out in the backyard
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.320]   and throw a baseball or throw a Frisbee or do something?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.280]   It's possible, but it's not,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.120]   it doesn't last for much.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.040]   And so why are the yards empty in many cases?
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.120]   Well, it's due to this lack of texture.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.920]   It's due to this lack of engagement.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.840]   So I think that's the mindset that you should use
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.800]   when you're judging the particular suburban house
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.840]   that you're looking at
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.880]   is get an idea of how much stuff is there in the yard,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.320]   how much engagement.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.240]   The more packed the backyard is,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.480]   the more secret hidey holes,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.920]   the more shovels that you can leave out
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.040]   for your children to dig with,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.240]   the more engaged your children are going to be.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.360]   But if it's a beautifully manicured rental house
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.640]   with green grass and maybe one play structure,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.480]   if that, you're gonna have a hard time
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.400]   making that as engaging as you might hope it would be.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.720]   Now let's turn to the luxury apartment with a pool.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   First, I think that the size of the apartment
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.320]   is really gonna matter.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   And the room structure is also going to matter.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.880]   So what I would look for
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.400]   if I'm looking to make my life easy as a parent
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.280]   is ideally to have play spaces.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.240]   And so if you have a larger luxury apartment,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.360]   maybe you can put all the children
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.000]   into one room for sleeping,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.920]   but that leaves another room that's totally empty.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.520]   Now you can start to build texture in an apartment.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.760]   So if you can put in equipment where they can climb
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   and couches where they can destroy things
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.840]   and make forts and pull everything apart
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.440]   and boxes that they can hide.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.960]   And if you can bring stuff in to engage with children,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.440]   especially, again, some kind of climbing apparatus,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.160]   then you could probably create something
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   that's mostly equivalent to the other kind of backyard
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   option because you have the space.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.760]   And if you can fill it with material
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.920]   that's gonna be interesting and engaging to children,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.720]   then you know you're on the right track.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.200]   Now, the pool is definitely attractive
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.120]   and it's attractive because it will give an activity
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.480]   that goes on for longer.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.320]   It's not what, whereas, you know,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.920]   just a random play structure in a barren yard
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.720]   is probably good for 20 or 30 minutes of play.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.280]   A pool is usually good for an hour or more of play.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.400]   I do think it's important that you not have a pool
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.320]   in your backyard as a parent.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.240]   The risks, the drowning risks of having a pool
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.640]   in the backyard, I'm gonna use strong language,
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.160]   they're unacceptable.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.720]   They are, many people do them.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.480]   Tons of people love having a pool,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.800]   but if you have children who can't yet swim,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.280]   then the drowning risk is enormous.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.760]   And you can certainly beef it up.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.960]   You could have a cover on the pool.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.200]   You can have a fence around the pool.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.520]   You can have alarms on the doors.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.120]   You can have all kinds of special things
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   that make a pool right at your house safer.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.960]   And those things are all important to do
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.080]   if you happen to live in a house with a pool.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.360]   But every single year,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.440]   there are many, many children who drown
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.760]   due to standing on a chair and pulling open the door
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   'cause they watch the parents disengage the alarm
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.760]   every single time.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.360]   So having a pool that's at an apartment complex
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   or an apartment building that you can go to,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.480]   but it's not so easily accessible is a good idea.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.960]   The question comes down here is,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.760]   are you going to be able to do it?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.360]   Is your wife gonna be able to do it?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040]   Or can you just send the children?
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.880]   Probably not.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.040]   So now, the pool may not actually be helpful.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.840]   The whole point of the backyard
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.080]   is that mom can be working inside,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.840]   it's three o'clock, she needs a break,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.640]   and she says, "Children, go outside.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.000]   "I'll call you when it's time for dinner."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.840]   And she gets an hour or two in the house by herself
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.880]   with the children away.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.680]   That's the point of the backyard.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.240]   The pool, on the other hand,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.560]   is she's gonna have to go
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.480]   and she's gonna have to watch them, usually.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   It's very rare to find a place where you're allowed to
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.560]   or where it would be culturally appropriate
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   to just send your children,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   especially young children, unaccompanied to the pool.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.440]   And so that may not be such a big difference for her,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.520]   as is hoped.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.440]   What it may help out, though,
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.480]   is doing things like having parties.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.880]   You may be able to have more pool parties,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.320]   which will help in the social life.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   It may provide your wife with more tools
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.040]   that, let's say she's gonna get together
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   with other moms and other children,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.800]   invite them all over for a pool party
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.240]   every Thursday afternoon.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.400]   Usually, you'll have a lot more payoff with a pool
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.000]   as a social anchoring mechanism
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.440]   for children to have children's parties
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.320]   rather than a simple swing set.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.640]   And then you just have the swing set in a bare backyard,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.200]   you won't quite know what to do.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.300]   But if you have a pool,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.680]   then that'll occupy the children for a couple of hours
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   while the moms and dads can sit around and talk.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.840]   I would suggest, however,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   that you not just evaluate this
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.360]   on the single dimension of backyard versus pool.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.620]   What I'm more interested in
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.860]   is what other infrastructure is there in the area.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.000]   So let's start with things like a park.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.400]   Having local parks is enormously helpful
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.240]   as a lifestyle option.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.960]   Local parks usually will offer some measure
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.080]   of texture, like I described,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.840]   where they're gonna be more engaging for children.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.440]   I've seen some bad parks.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.320]   Bad parks are usually beautifully manicured,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.600]   grass everywhere and some play structures,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.040]   and they're dreadfully boring for children.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.600]   But if you have a park that is wooded
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.280]   and has some brushy areas
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.400]   and has a few different amenities
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.560]   that the children can engage in
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.180]   and they can go off and climb trees
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.620]   and be off by themselves,
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.940]   that's a very attractive thing.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.260]   And so look to see how far away is the local park.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.960]   Ideally, it would be awesome
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.160]   if you had a park that was within a short walking distance.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.560]   So if I had to choose between the two options,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.640]   I would rather have a luxury apartment
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   with a pool in the complex
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.800]   and be able to walk to the park in five minutes.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.640]   I'll take that over a suburb
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.000]   where the park is a 15-minute drive away.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.320]   The local park is a 15-minute drive away.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.440]   Having a local park is an enormous booster
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.800]   of quality of life.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.700]   And sometimes in the city where the apartment is,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.520]   you may have closer access to that.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.880]   Think about other activities and other amenities,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.580]   things like classes, community organizations,
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.920]   activities that are not related just to school,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   but also you should think about school,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.420]   but let's focus on other kinds of things.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.900]   If you can be close enough to activities
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.360]   where you can say to your child,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.760]   10-year-old, ride the bike
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.080]   and go down to your karate class, it's four o'clock,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.240]   and he can just ride over two or three blocks
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   and he's there, that's enormously valuable
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.840]   as compared to being car-centric.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.480]   I'm enormously passionate about this subject
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.560]   because I believe that we need to improve our cities
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.840]   and towns, at least in the United States, quite a lot.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.040]   And I'm always torn between what the data indicates on this
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.920]   and how things could be.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   So if we look at birth rates around the world,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   what we can see is that cities seem to be toxic to children
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.360]   if we're measuring them by birth rates.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.400]   When we have large, built-out cities,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.920]   people stop having children.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.300]   And all around the world,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   the biggest cities wind up being fairly barren of children.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.240]   If people can spread out and they live in the suburbs,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.520]   then they tend to have more children.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.780]   So we know that families prefer the suburbs.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.680]   It's a fairly obvious thing that people prefer
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.800]   and they want to do.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   They go to the suburbs when they have children.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.200]   We know that families prefer the suburbs,
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.280]   and we know that families are able to,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   and people in the suburbs have more children.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.880]   The problem is I don't think that the suburbs
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.760]   are actually that great for children.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.220]   I think that the suburbs tend to be fairly isolating.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.620]   One of my favorite videos that I send out frequently
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.920]   and reference to people frequently
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.320]   is from the YouTube channel, Not Just Bikes.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.200]   And the video is titled,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.920]   "Why We Won't Raise Our Children in Suburbia."
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   And the summary of the video is that this Canadian father
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.220]   and his wife, when they had children,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.040]   they knew that they did not want to live
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.180]   in London, Ontario, Canada, where they were from,
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.580]   because it was a suburb-focused lifestyle.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.020]   Instead, they wanted to live
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.900]   in the middle of a vibrant city.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.980]   And they chose Amsterdam, Netherlands.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   And the reason they did that, one reason,
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.400]   is that living in the city can provide children
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.540]   with a much higher level of independence
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.480]   and personal autonomy.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.900]   Suburbs tend to be very isolating for children
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.140]   because in order for them to go anywhere,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.580]   in order for them to do anything,
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.900]   in order for them to see their friends,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.700]   they have to be driven there by their parents.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.100]   And so they wind up sitting in their house all the time,
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.240]   alone, instead of being able to go elsewhere.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.020]   And as the evidence demonstrates in Not Just Bikes video,
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.620]   he shows how in the Netherlands, where in Amsterdam,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.220]   where the planning authorities have taken great care
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:23.220]   to create both safe pathways
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.340]   for pedestrians and bicyclists
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.940]   that are separated from cars,
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.560]   as well as to build out a robust public transit system,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.900]   Dutch children have greater personal freedom
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.300]   and greater autonomy.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.660]   A nine-year-old Dutch boy can easily ride his own bicycle
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.400]   to his school and ride home again.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.620]   So he can take himself to school
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.980]   in a neighborhood school easily and back again.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.420]   And as a parent, you can feel totally happy about that
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.020]   because, and totally confident about that
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.780]   because of the good engineering
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.520]   that keeps bicyclists separated from dangerous vehicles.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.660]   In addition, though,
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.860]   the same Dutch boy can ride to his friend's house.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.600]   He can take himself to his sporting events.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.420]   He can take himself to his after-school events and classes.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.580]   He's basically an independent child
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.260]   that doesn't have to rely on his parents for everything.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.700]   And in my interest in maturing children,
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.460]   this is actually enormously important to me.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.220]   I think we infantilize teenagers
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.140]   and still children even, eight, nine years old,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.860]   and we expect them to do things,
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.600]   in today's world, we keep them from doing things
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.820]   that they really should be doing.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.940]   Throughout history, it's not been any way abnormal
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.980]   for eight-year-old children to run freely around a city.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.300]   But in today's world, there are various reasons
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.900]   that we highly restrict our children from doing that.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.460]   Now, some of those reasons make sense.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.380]   I think the biggest reason that makes sense
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.780]   has to do with the threat of vehicles.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.260]   For those of you who are not parents
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.060]   who are just listening to this particular commentary,
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.400]   the way that you perceive automobiles
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.460]   changes enormously when you have children.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.940]   And everything that formerly seemed like,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.420]   "Oh, it's no big deal,"
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.260]   when you have children,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.980]   you understand how unpredictable children are
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.100]   and how unpredictable cars and drivers are.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.560]   And separating your children
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.920]   from the presence of automobiles
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.700]   becomes a very high concern,
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.620]   something that is very important.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.380]   And most American cities are designed
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.300]   primarily around convenience of drivers and automobiles
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.060]   and not around the convenience of pedestrians
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.440]   or other forms of transit or transportation.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.680]   So this makes cities very dangerous places for children.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.740]   The vehicles are the major problem.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.820]   And so if you can separate vehicles out of a neighborhood,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.620]   or if you can separate vehicles away from the pathways
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.500]   where individuals will walk or will bicycle,
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.540]   it creates a much more welcoming,
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.260]   much more wholesome environment
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.840]   where you can be more confident for your children
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.120]   going back and forth to school,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.420]   going back and forth to their friends' houses.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.420]   Now, some of those things are cultural
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.500]   and some of those things are real.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.460]   The culture has become so uptight around managing children
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.900]   that if you allow your children to do something
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.180]   that was totally normal 20 years ago,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.620]   then there's a good chance
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.540]   that somebody's gonna call the cops on you,
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.100]   at least in American society.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.580]   That's a separate problem.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.740]   But it is genuinely a problem
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.260]   that we need to create distinction and differentiation
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.180]   and keep the cars where the cars belong
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.460]   and really build neighborhoods that are safe for children.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.900]   So that's a real danger.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.840]   There are other dangers that people worry about.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.820]   People worry about dangers from predators
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.700]   and things like that for children.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.820]   Those concerns obviously have to be considered,
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.640]   but from an analytical perspective,
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.780]   they really don't bear out.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.500]   Today, we have far greater safety for children
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.400]   than ever before.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.820]   And in fact, the best and safest places for children
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.780]   are in highly populated areas.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.240]   If you have someplace like the suburbs,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.580]   where there just aren't that many people out on the roads,
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.860]   aren't that many people out,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.460]   then somebody who wishes to harm a child
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.540]   can often do so without a great deal of external observance.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.580]   But if your child is passing through busy city streets
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.220]   and somebody tries to harm him,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.020]   then there's a much greater sense of safety and security
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.500]   for him in those city streets
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.620]   where there are many people around
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.340]   that can see and protect the child.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.580]   So what I'm kind of opaquely driving at here
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.460]   is that it's not all about the backyard.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.140]   The backyard is really only relevant for a few years,
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.940]   that point in time from say two or three years old
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.580]   to maybe seven or eight or nine years old,
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.100]   where the child really just needs a place
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.940]   to be able to play and the noise level is super high,
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.400]   so you want the child to be outside of the house.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.220]   Once you get past those years, however,
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.980]   I think it's all this other stuff
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.620]   that winds up being much more impactful
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.060]   and much more valuable.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.440]   Your 10-year-old will appreciate the park
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.100]   much more than a small backyard in suburbia.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.980]   Your 10-year-old will appreciate proximity to friends
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.000]   and other families more than the particular feature
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.620]   of any particular house.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.180]   Your 12-year-old and 13-year-old will gain more
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.700]   from being able to have a higher degree
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.060]   of independence and autonomy,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.240]   being able to come and go rather than being stuck
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.140]   where mom and dad have to drive this person everywhere.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.540]   There are some other factors we could add in.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.020]   We could talk about weather.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.380]   For example, I grew up in South Florida.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.940]   I grew up where it was hot.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.020]   I grew up in a house where we didn't have air conditioning
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.100]   and in my day, back in my day,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.980]   we just played outside all year round.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.480]   I didn't really care about heat.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.420]   What I've observed, however, with friends and family members
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.140]   is that the heat has become a bigger deal.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.060]   It may be hotter than it was before
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.580]   or we just could be softer than we were
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.420]   or maybe just the distinction between
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.940]   an air-conditioned house and outside
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.140]   is more shocking than it was.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.380]   But if you're in Florida or in Arizona
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.940]   and you're thinking about the summertime,
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.660]   it doesn't matter how much texture you have in the backyard,
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.660]   there's a good chance that the children
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.860]   won't wanna be in it.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.980]   And so the vote would go for the apartment complex
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.860]   with the indoor pool so that it can be used more.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.300]   So weather is always a factor.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.180]   Also though, think about factors for you as a father
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.900]   or for your wife as a mother.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.260]   Factors of where are your friends, where is your work?
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.380]   If you could live in an apartment
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.980]   that is two blocks away from your job
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.100]   and you can walk back and forth to your job,
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.740]   I would pick that over a house in the suburbs
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.780]   that's 30 minutes away from your job.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.540]   Because if you can walk back and forth,
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.060]   not only can you trim your expenses
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.860]   by perhaps being a one-car family
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.060]   instead of a two-car family, which is convenient,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.920]   but you just free up so much time.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.700]   So you can leave for work at 8.55
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.060]   and you can come home for lunch,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   have lunch with your family,
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.020]   and you can be back home at 5.05
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.260]   to take the children to the park,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.980]   and that's when your wife gets a break.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.020]   So as you obviously already know,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.460]   it's not just one thing versus another.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.340]   If I had to choose between having a yard
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.340]   versus having a pool,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.240]   probably the yard is the winner
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.940]   because of the ability to send the children outside,
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.860]   get noise separation from the house,
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.040]   and the fact that you're probably never going
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.960]   to be able to send the children unsupervised to the pool.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.080]   But if the apartment were two blocks from my work
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.760]   and I could walk back and forth easily,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   and I could come and go with the children,
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.360]   and I could walk them down the street
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.720]   to their piano teacher and everything is super integrated,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.960]   I'll take the apartment because of the whole factors,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.800]   especially with the park.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.640]   And we'll just insert an hour or two at the park every day,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.420]   which is just around the block,
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.580]   rather than having the barren backyard.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.020]   So I really like urban living
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.940]   while also recognizing that it's not the choice
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.420]   that most parents usually make.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.260]   Where I would like to see us go
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.580]   is to take the things that are good about the suburbs
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.900]   and change the way we design houses
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.860]   so that we design villages
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.900]   that cater to the needs of families
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.500]   rather than just houses
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.520]   and we'd got to do everything ourself.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.720]   That is really the model.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.600]   And the model that has been historically normal
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.880]   throughout time is to have clusters and clumps of houses
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.440]   pushed together for all of the benefits of neighborliness
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.860]   and community living, things like that,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.860]   but then to also have common areas
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.720]   where all of the things that you need common areas for
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.400]   are set up.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.200]   And when you do that,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.060]   I think you get the best of both worlds.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.040]   So that's really what I would like to see us do
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.560]   is build and develop more village models
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.160]   and that integrate that
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.280]   without trying to do everything on individual land.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.600]   When you try to do it all on your individual land,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.200]   you wind up with big yards, big houses,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.280]   spread out suburbs where there's not enough people nearby
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   to get up any kind of outdoor game.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.400]   There's not enough friends.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.940]   So the outdoors just doesn't seem appealing.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.960]   And there's not enough real recreation spaces
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.320]   because it's just not big enough.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.840]   You drive down a suburb and as I said,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.640]   you see every seventh house has a place structure
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.000]   in the backyard and it's usually empty.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.440]   So I appreciate the benefits of the suburbs,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.080]   but I think we need to go a step further
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.540]   and we need to redesign the suburbs in favor of families
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.280]   and we need to redesign cities in favor of families.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.520]   And that's a real personal interest of mine.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.640]   If you're interested in more of this,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.860]   check out some of the urbanism stuff
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.460]   that you can find online.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.600]   I would say not just bikes
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.880]   is probably a good introduction to that.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.120]   I'm really a big fan of the strong towns work.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.560]   So check out strong towns
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.280]   where people are actively talking about it,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.640]   not just from a utopian pie in the sky,
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.020]   we can fix all of this,
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.680]   but more of how do we work with what we have,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.760]   the infrastructure that we've inherited
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.000]   and make our towns flourish in a way that is possible.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.980]   And so I'm super passionate about promoting strong towns.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.140]   And I think that some of that overall thinking
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.480]   is going to factor in,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.040]   but hopefully I've given you enough ideas
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.840]   that you should be able to differentiate
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.160]   between these options a little more clearly.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.600]   Guys, stop what you're doing.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.720]   Have you seen the latest essentials from Express?

[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.120]   I mean, give me one in every color.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.320]   Or their 1MX shirts,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.560]   hands down the best button downs out there.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.160]   And don't get me started on that denim.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.640]   I never knew a pair of jeans could fit me this well.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.200]   I'm telling you, get in store or online at express.com
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.440]   now to shop the new essentials at Express.
