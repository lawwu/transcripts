[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   And the conclusion I made from that is,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.960]   it's a fair guess that through most of our species history,
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.520]   work pace was incredibly varied.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.680]   Intense periods followed by relaxed periods
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.640]   at all sorts of different scales.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:25.760]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.720]   The show about living and working deeply in a world
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.080]   increasingly beset by distraction.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.920]   joined as normal by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   So Jesse, it's official.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.840]   As of two days before the recording of this episode,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.280]   I submitted my manuscript for my new book,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.480]   Slow Productivity, to my publisher.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.280]   For the last two days, I have had no writing to do.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.960]   No morning writing sessions, no trying to get my edits in,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.880]   no where's my hours, I gotta get my hours.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.120]   I am on a break from writing temporarily.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360]   That manuscript has been submitted.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.560]   - So what's temporarily mean?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800]   Well, like another half a day?
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.360]   - All right, if I'm gonna be honest,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.440]   we're gonna be honest about this.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.400]   The day after I submitted the manuscript,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.480]   I had a phone call with my editor at The New Yorker,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.600]   and we were already planning out the next piece,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.560]   which I've started on.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.520]   But I'm free from the, the thing about book writing
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.040]   is to make my schedule,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.400]   because I had to do this in about six months,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.900]   every day mattered.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.920]   So there was that constant pressure.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.200]   You don't have that constant pressure
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   if you're working on one article,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.720]   'cause you might be in a phase where you're researching it.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.440]   You're like, yeah, I'm waiting to hear back from some people.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.080]   I'm reading about it, I'm thinking about it,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   and then three days, you'll just write it.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.240]   A book is every single day,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   because you got a lot you have to build up.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.400]   Now, submission, for those who don't know
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.160]   how the nonfiction book publishing process works,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.280]   there's a lot of steps.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.200]   So submission is actually not that important
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.720]   of an official step.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.360]   From a contractual perspective,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.560]   the thing that matters is acceptance of the manuscript.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.920]   That happens after back and forth editing.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.960]   So submission, for some people that might be like me,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.880]   here's the whole thing,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.400]   but you could be submitting things along the way.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.840]   You could have worked with your editor
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   to finish chapter one,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.320]   and then worked with them to finish chapter two.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.840]   There's no real, the contract says nothing about that.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.000]   What matters is the acceptance of the manuscript,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640]   and that's after all editing has happened
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.840]   and everyone's pretty happy with it.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's actually typically advance money tied
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   to when the manuscript's accepted.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880]   And then after that, you shift into the production phase.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.440]   So now a whole different set of editors get involved,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.320]   and this is where you get things like the copy editing
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.200]   followed by the production editing.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.560]   You start caring about commas,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.520]   you start caring about the proper capitalization of titles,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.360]   et cetera, like that.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.840]   So it's a really long process,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.280]   but getting a full version of the manuscript done
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.400]   is for the writer, psychologically speaking,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.240]   a big milestone.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.160]   So I'm glad to be past that milestone,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.600]   and I really am gonna try to slow down this semester.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.040]   - So when do you start your next book?
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.440]   'Cause I know you're under contract.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.320]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.600]   I'm under contract for two, TBD.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.360]   So we have to figure out that timing,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   but I just wanna take a break
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   from even thinking about that.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.400]   - Yeah, I guess I just keep on thinking,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.160]   I think I was listening to a holiday interview
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.800]   with Tyler Cohen, and he was talking about
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.560]   how he's always writing a book,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.040]   and I just figured, I just, for some reason,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.280]   was thinking that's what you're gonna be doing now.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   - I mean, I will more or less,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.720]   but I'm trying to take a few months off.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.560]   - Okay.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   - Like to me, so this is,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.280]   and it's gonna bring us back to the theme
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.120]   of today's episode.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.720]   Now for me, taking time off means, you know,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.600]   two jobs instead of four or something like that,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.560]   but I see this as this wonderfully relaxing period
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.720]   coming up, because I'm gonna be
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   just like a normal professor for a while.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.400]   You know, I've got my classes,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   I'm teaching two classes this semester.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.240]   I'm teaching, I'm dealing with students.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.080]   I plan to have at any one time,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.720]   one academic article, and maybe one New Yorker article,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.200]   sort of in the hopper, rotating back and forth.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.880]   But that's really different than having a book
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.720]   you're trying to get done,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.080]   because if you do nothing on Wednesday, not a big deal.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.360]   It's yeah, but maybe I'm thinking about this,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.640]   I'm working on proofs for this,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   and oh, now I'm gonna write a draft of this.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.960]   So it's just like normal load.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   It's like a normal professor life for a while,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.120]   which to me seems like it's gonna be wonderfully relaxing.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   We'll see if that actually works.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   Then my plan is as the semester begins to wind down,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.200]   then I'll wind up the new book.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.160]   I think at the very least,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.560]   I wanna get past manuscript acceptance for the current book
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.800]   before I'm doing anything too serious for the next,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.880]   'cause I don't wanna mix those two worlds together.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.240]   Once we're in production for the current book,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   then maybe I can actually start working in earnest.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.600]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.760]   That does, however, bring us to the deep question
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.960]   I wanna tackle in today's episode.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.800]   So I'm interested in this idea of temporarily slowing down
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.720]   on a regular basis as a strategy
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.160]   for achieving sustainability in your career,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.920]   especially if you have an ambitious
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.800]   or elite knowledge work career.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   How do we make that sustainable?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.200]   How do we make that something that is deep in the long run?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.520]   So that's the deep question I wanna tackle today.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.840]   How do I avoid working all out all the time?
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.160]   So here's how we're gonna tackle this in today's episode.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.760]   We're gonna start with a deep dive
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.120]   on a topic very relevant to what we're talking about,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.840]   to the deep question this show's all about.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.760]   After the deep dive,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.480]   we'll go on and do some listener questions.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.880]   I've pulled questions that are all related
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   one way or to the other to this general theme
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   of trying to slow down, balancing relaxation with work.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.440]   So how do you get that back and forth balance going?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.120]   They're all related one way or the other,
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.440]   so we can take these ideas out for a spin with real issues.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   I also have a case study in there
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.280]   of someone who has found sort of a nice way
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   to get that balance into their lives.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   And then we'll end this episode as I like to
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.320]   whenever possible discussing something interesting.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.520]   All right, that sounds like a plan.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.800]   Does that sound good, Jesse?
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.640]   - Sounds great.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.560]   - You know what we've forgotten to do
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.280]   and I feel bad about this?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.320]   Books.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.140]   - Yeah.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.160]   - We keep forgetting to talk about
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.040]   the books I read in December.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.200]   - Yeah.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.520]   - We will do that soon, folks.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.360]   That's just me.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.060]   I actually had it on my calendar.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.000]   I had on my calendar, bring in the books
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   for today's episodes, but I'll tell you what happened.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.000]   A school event got added for one of my kids
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840]   at the last minute.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.400]   So like I was at that school event,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.800]   that's why I'm a little late today.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.880]   And that went right into a two hour meeting
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.960]   that went right into me finishing my prep
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   and coming over here.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.040]   If I get knocked off my routine at all,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.140]   the whole house of cards begins to fall
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.400]   because I'm scrambling to get to my kid's school,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.040]   which means I'm not building my time block plan properly.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.320]   It all falls apart with just a little bit
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.960]   of an obligatory wind right there.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.280]   - Yeah, we'll get in the books though.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.120]   - We'll get them in.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.940]   We'll get them in.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.780]   I read some good ones.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.600]   All right, let's do a deep dive.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   I wanna talk about the topic of work cycles.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.320]   And in order to get to this topic,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.800]   let me back up a little bit and set the stage.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.080]   So what's the issue
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.440]   that this strategy is gonna try to solve?
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.220]   Well, I wanna pull a quote
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.420]   from a New Yorker piece I wrote a few months ago.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.260]   We've talked about it on the show before.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.080]   This was the New Yorker piece where I went back
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.840]   and said, "What does the research about work
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.260]   in our deep history?"
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.360]   So we're talking about the Paleolithic period,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.040]   roughly 300,000 years,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.060]   300,000 years where Homo sapiens were anatomically modern,
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.760]   but we were living pre-agricultural,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.920]   mainly hunter-gatherer lives.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.820]   So the longest period of our species' existence,
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.500]   what did work mean then?
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.140]   And the whole point of that essay, as you'll probably recall,
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.220]   is that I then compared that to modern knowledge work,
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.440]   looking for places where there was a real discrepancy.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.200]   And seeing these might be sources of friction
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.240]   where what we're doing today is not meshing
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.280]   with the wiring that was set into place
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.700]   over many years in the past.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.600]   So in that article,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.320]   one of the particular topics I looked at
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.040]   was the pace of work.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   And here's a quote from a paper written by Mark Dybul,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.560]   among others, he was the lead author,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.960]   that was comparing a extant hunter-gatherer tribe's
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.320]   work rhythms to a nearby tribe that was still,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.040]   oh, I shouldn't say tribe.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   That's not the word to use, I learned.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.320]   Community, community.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.880]   So this is from a research paper that came in Nature
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.800]   about they were studying the work rhythms
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.680]   of a largely hunting and gathering community
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.480]   compared to a nearby community that was agricultural.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.560]   And here's what was said in the article.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.400]   "The pace of the forager schedule was more varied,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.360]   "with breaks interspersed throughout their daily efforts.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.460]   "Hunting trips required a long hike through the forest,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.360]   "so you'd be out all day, but you'd have breaks,"
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.780]   Dybul told me.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.800]   "With something like fishing, there are spikes,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.100]   "ups and downs, only a small percent of their time
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.900]   "is spent actually fishing."
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.320]   And the conclusion I made from that is,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.540]   it's a fair guess that through most of our species history,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.120]   work pace was incredibly varied.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.280]   Intense periods followed by relaxed periods
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.520]   at all sorts of different scales.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.080]   We're out hunting, but the sun is hot,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   and we're gonna rest for three hours
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   till it gets a little less.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.220]   Where spear fishing, like the Ajta people
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.200]   that we're studying in this particular paper,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.240]   but there's gonna be long periods.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.800]   How long can we actually be underwater,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.640]   holding our breath?
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.420]   There's long periods where we're just resting in the boat.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.080]   Now, if we look at the history of work,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.760]   we can understand that in part as a long march away
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.680]   from this widely varied work pace.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.660]   So as we shifted from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic,
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.440]   so as we had the introduction of agriculture,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.400]   and now we're talking between 15 to 10,000 years ago,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   we saw the first shift.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.300]   We began to get, during the planting and harvesting seasons,
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.740]   days of continual effort without break.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.160]   So if it is October,
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.480]   and you're trying to get that harvest in,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.200]   you're not taking long naps during the day.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.060]   Those are long days, sun up to sun down.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.240]   However, in the early Neolithic,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.360]   through almost up to the modern period,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.520]   you had months that were incredibly relaxed,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.860]   lower-paced work versus months that were more intense.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.800]   We still had a seasonality at the literal scale of seasons.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.240]   In January, there was not much to do,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.060]   whereas in October, you might've been really busy.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.500]   All right, now let's fast forward all the way
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.040]   to the rise of factory work,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   followed by factory-style office work,
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.160]   by which I mean nine to five,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.480]   you show up like you would to a factory.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   There, we got the consistently hard days year-round.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.400]   There is no, "Oh, January, you don't work much,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.840]   "but October, you work more."
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.540]   No, no, you're working all day long,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.000]   without long breaks, every week of the year,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.200]   but whatever, a vacation exception,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.680]   and there's somewhere or the other.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.800]   We still had, however, clear shutdowns.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   So if you worked at Ford, building cars,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.680]   that's hard work from when you start to when you finish.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   There is no seasons that are less hard work,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.280]   but when you go home, there is nothing for you to do.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.040]   There's no work related to building Model Ts
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.800]   that you can bring back to your house and continue doing,
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.440]   and this was true, of course, of early office-style,
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.240]   or factory-style office work as well.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.180]   When you weren't at your desk, where your papers were,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.640]   and whatever, your assistant was, and the typing pool was,
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.480]   when you weren't at your desk,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.520]   there was very little work you could actually do.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.480]   So you had at least clear shutdowns within the day binary,
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.700]   work, non-work.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.320]   Finally, we get to where we are today,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.080]   which is office work in the age of computer networks,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.180]   and now work is always available.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.800]   You always have access to work.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.920]   There's always more work for you to do.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.120]   It's being delivered via email.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.540]   It's being delivered via Slack.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.820]   The tools you need to actually make progress on this work
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.660]   are with you.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.500]   They're mobile.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.320]   They're with you at home.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.360]   They're with you on vacation.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.640]   They're with you when you're in the car.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.720]   So work is now always available.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.720]   This is where we're really getting into trouble
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.580]   because we've created an environment
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.400]   where work is always available,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.960]   and then we combined it with what we talk about
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.200]   often on this show as the unstructured approach
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.280]   to productivity, unstructured productivity,
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.360]   where we say in knowledge work,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.820]   we don't have a particular system we use
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.720]   for assigning work or tracking work,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.600]   or keeping track of who's working on what,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   or figuring out when you're gonna work on things.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.740]   It's just up to you.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.800]   Productivity is personal.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.560]   Just do what you think is useful for the company.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.640]   We're not gonna tell you how to do your work.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.540]   This combination, work is always available.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.240]   You're always able to do work,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.880]   and there's no real structure to how work gets done.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.700]   It's just left up to you.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.600]   Hey, do what you're going to do.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.800]   This has led to a much increased rate
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.560]   of just continual effort.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.420]   Now, it's not that we work every waking hours.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.840]   What we do instead, and again, we talk about this often,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.740]   what we do instead in this combination
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.240]   of always available work and unstructured productivity
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.840]   is that we just let stuff pile up
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.920]   until we are so stressed from the work
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.160]   that we feel like we have psychological cover
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.840]   to say no to what comes next.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.040]   So we just push ourselves till we're overloaded,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.960]   and that gives us justification to say,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.720]   well, this is why I'm stopping, because I'm exhausted.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.280]   I'm up late working, and this is why I feel okay
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.800]   stopping until the next morning,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.440]   because I already worked till two in the morning.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.460]   So we let our own sense of overload and stress
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.300]   be the governor.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.800]   That ensures by definition
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.600]   that we're always working too much.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.240]   Unstructured productivity, always available work.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.760]   So really what we have here is a collision
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.860]   of two different types of factors,
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.120]   a cultural factor, unstructured productivity,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.880]   and a technological factor, always available work.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.420]   That's a technological thing.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.120]   Unstructured productivity, that's a cultural thing.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.040]   I'm always interested where technological forces
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.120]   hit cultural forces is.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   Unexpected outcomes often arise, and this is one.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.660]   Knowledge workers are often now in the state
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.180]   of always working too much.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.920]   This is a recipe for burnout.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   You can only sustain that so long.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.740]   Some people get the burnout faster than others.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.100]   There's different reactions to the stress of this overwork,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.760]   but it's not good.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.600]   It's not good.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.980]   So what do we do about this?
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.100]   Well, we have to find ways to structure productivity more
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.560]   to get us away from the setting
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.420]   where we just sort of go at it until we're so stressed
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.280]   we feel like we have cover to say no.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.480]   There is many different ways to solve this problem.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.320]   We might even wanna say there's many different things
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.960]   you can do to help make progress on this problem.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.040]   I wanna talk about one particular strategy today
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.720]   that I came across when I was writing the book
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.400]   I'm working on now on slow productivity,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.000]   and I wanted to share it with you.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.800]   So I'm actually gonna jump over now on the screen.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.360]   For those who are watching this at YouTube,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.480]   youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.640]   This is episode 231.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   For those who are watching on YouTube,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.360]   you will see this on your screen,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.960]   but I'll also narrate it for those who are just listening.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.320]   What I have loaded up here is the chapter nine
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.120]   of the Basecamp Employee Handbook.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.680]   So Basecamp is a software development,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.300]   product development tech company.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.480]   It's co-founded, you may know,
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.240]   it's co-founder and CEO, Jason Fried.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.440]   Him and I did an event together
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.680]   when I launched my last book, "A World Without Email."
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.720]   So we've crossed paths a few times.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.120]   They're very innovative in thinking about work.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.440]   So Jason, the co-founder,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.280]   has co-authored multiple books
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.720]   about rethinking knowledge work,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.960]   including "Rework" and one that's called
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.360]   "Work Doesn't Have to Be This Way."
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.740]   So it's a company in which the principals
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.040]   do a lot of thinking about how can we make work better,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   even if it requires radical changes.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.880]   So their handbook is actually itself
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.800]   a fascinating business advice read
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.880]   because you're exposed to all of these experiments
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.720]   they're trying.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.120]   Well, in chapter nine of this handbook,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.940]   and it's what I have loaded on the screen now,
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.340]   they talk about cycles.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.280]   Now I'm gonna read from the handbook right now.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.600]   We work in six to eight week cycles at Basecamp.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   There are typically six cycles to a year.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.560]   Two are eight week cycles during summer hours
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.360]   and the rest are six week cycles.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.200]   This fixed cadence serves to give us
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.720]   an internal sense of urgency,
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.120]   work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   and provide a regular interval
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.760]   to decide what we're working on.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.960]   The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.240]   has to take six to eight weeks
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.320]   or can be completed in that time,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.000]   but rather that we think about how we can break big projects
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.520]   into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.920]   And that we bundle smaller things
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.180]   into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.640]   All right, now I'm gonna skip forward a little bit.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.340]   This is what I like about the cycle strategy.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.400]   This next section called "Cool Down."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.960]   In between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.060]   That's the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.680]   that come up, write up what we worked on
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.280]   and figure out what we should tackle next.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.560]   It's sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.340]   into the cool down period to fit in more work,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.100]   but the goal is to resist this temptation.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:37.320]   I think this is a brilliant strategy.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.760]   It matches the natural rhythm of work
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.720]   for which human beings are better suited.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.880]   So this idea of work intensely for a while,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.480]   then cool down for a couple of weeks.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.920]   Okay, let's just, everyone chill.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.220]   Let's just hammer out some final bugs
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.960]   and kind of have some brainstorming type meetings
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.000]   about what comes next.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   We wake up, we come to work a little late.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.200]   We're not staying late.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.680]   The inbox is reasonable.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   And then once that two weeks is over,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   let's get after it again.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.360]   Okay, now we speed back up
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.120]   and we're working urgently on something we're all in.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.360]   Then we cool down again.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   That general pattern on, off, on, off is very effective.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.760]   It is a much more sustainable way of having a profession
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.200]   where you have to create value
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.240]   using only what's happening in between your ears
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.080]   from your brain.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   It's a much sustainable way to create value with your brain
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.660]   than what most people do,
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.520]   which is keep saying yes till you're so stressed
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.000]   that you feel like you have cover to say no
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.840]   and hope you don't burn out too soon.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   So I really like this cycle idea.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.840]   There's a couple of different ways
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.680]   that you could actually implement this.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.520]   If you're running a team or running a company,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.640]   you could do what Basecamp did.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.000]   This is how we actually operate.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.760]   You could make this your culture.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.000]   I don't care what lengths you do
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.360]   other than the cooldowns need to be non-trivial,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.960]   longer than a day.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.160]   But you could say this is how we do it.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   It's one month on, one month off.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.800]   The semester on, then we take a month
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   that's a little more relaxed.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.760]   At three months, three weeks,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.600]   however you wanna do it.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.240]   But having a regular rhythm of on, off, on, off
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.520]   is something that you should consider.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.240]   Now I think the managers out there are saying,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.080]   wait a second, think about all of
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.280]   the wasted productivity during the cooldown period.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.520]   We're gonna be getting that much less work done.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.400]   My response to this is the same response
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.740]   Basecamp would have, which is nonsense.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.500]   The amount of high quality work you get done
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.400]   during the intense period of the cycles
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.320]   is going to add up to much more quality results
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.240]   if you balance those with cooldowns
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.920]   than if you instead just try to push through
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.480]   all out, all year round.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.840]   Because what happens if you just try to push
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.400]   all out, all year round?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.600]   That energy flags.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.480]   And the amount of effort you're doing
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.280]   six months into the year is a lot worse
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.400]   than it was earlier.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.440]   A lot worse than it would be
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.360]   if you actually had regular cooldown periods.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.320]   You're gonna get more done,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.240]   it's gonna be higher quality,
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.560]   people aren't gonna burn out.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.160]   Now what if you don't have control of a team?
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.360]   What if you don't run your own company?
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.640]   Do this stealthily on your own.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.080]   Internally, without telling other people,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.800]   I have cycles.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.880]   And during this bit of the cycle,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.600]   I'm all on, this week or this two weeks,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.680]   I'm pulling back.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.720]   You can do this without having
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.760]   to make any declarations,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.040]   without having to get anything signed off on
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.600]   by a boss without really attracting
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   that much attention.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.160]   It's just a matter of making your weekly plans
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.520]   sparse during the cooldown periods.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.860]   Just don't put much stuff into those weekly plans.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.960]   Being really careful about scheduling things
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.320]   during cooldown periods.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.720]   To the degree you can get away with this
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.080]   without it being notable, punt.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.560]   Well, yeah, I was talking,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.640]   I'm not really available that week,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.480]   but the next week,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.680]   or let's get back to this after the break.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.800]   So you sort of move things around.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.000]   And for the things that you have to schedule
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.320]   during the cooldown period,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.680]   have multiple days that are meeting free.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.200]   Don't tell anyone you're doing this.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.320]   But just for that two weeks,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.480]   it's like, well, Tuesday and Thursday,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.400]   you're not offering up.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.480]   So you have multiple days in these cooldown weeks
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.960]   where you have no Zoom and no calls and no meetings.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   Be careful about your larger projects.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.120]   If you have a project that's gonna end
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.720]   and another one's gonna start,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.040]   don't start that one during a cooldown period.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.440]   Be strategic about when you bring things on.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.240]   So these stealth cycles with stealth cooldown periods
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.340]   can be just as effective as working at a company
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.880]   like Basecamp that has this built
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.000]   right into their handbook.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.960]   Now what's gonna happen is,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.040]   not only is this gonna make your work more sustainable,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.760]   I think you are gonna become more valued in your company
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.520]   because the intensity of your intense periods is better.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.160]   The quality of what you produce is better
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.560]   when you know that cooldown is coming
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   and you get the benefit of that cooldown.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.320]   So what are your managers gonna notice?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.220]   Not that, you know, I really was crunching the numbers.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.960]   And statistically speaking,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.940]   in these two weeks out of the last six,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.000]   it seemed to me that Cal was not scheduling meetings
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.400]   on Tuesdays as much as he did during the other one.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.720]   We need to do something about this.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.800]   That's not what they're gonna notice.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.960]   What they're gonna notice is your peaks.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   Wow, like he really, this was great.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.160]   This thing he produced, you know, last month was very good.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.400]   This is someone that we really value.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.220]   So I'm a big believer in cycles,
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.560]   whether they be institutionalized
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.120]   or happening surreptitiously.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.080]   It is one way among many, I think,
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.760]   to feed into this natural inclination we have
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   for up and down.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.320]   We're chasing the gazelle.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.040]   Now we're taking a nap under the sun.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   This natural seasonality on all sorts of scales is useful.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.760]   Cycles gives us this on the scale of weeks.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.040]   So, you know what, Jesse, I take it for granted.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.440]   As a professor, we naturally have these type of cycles
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.620]   on that scale built in because semesters end, you know.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.620]   And we know this in academia, we're in between semesters.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.560]   Everyone is taking a beat.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.000]   You don't schedule meetings.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.360]   You don't expect people to respond to emails.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.000]   And then it ramps back up again.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.720]   And then you get the biggest cycle of all, which is summer.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.520]   And then summer is, so it's great.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.360]   That rhythm works well.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.600]   I take it for granted, but seeing Basecamp's handbook
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.000]   helped me understand this idea that instead of just saying,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.960]   "Too bad you're not a professor,"
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.480]   like a lot of people could have something similar
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.320]   to work in life.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.120]   It just takes a little effort.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   - I know that you coined a lot of terms.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.400]   Did you come up with the term unstructured productivity?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.920]   - I think so.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.320]   - It's a good term.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.880]   - Yeah, we need a glossary.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.800]   - Yeah, we do need a glossary.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.400]   - I invent terms frequently.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.720]   - Yeah, I know you're very good at it.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.040]   - Some stick, some don't.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.000]   - You might have to do a whole article
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.920]   on unstructured productivity.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.000]   That's good.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.680]   - Yeah, it's kind of an evolution.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.760]   It's an evolution of my thinking that shows up a lot more
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.280]   in my book, "Slow Productivity,"
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.000]   because I, not to give too much of the book away now,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.320]   there's so much to talk about when the time comes,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   but I really get an upfront,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.640]   a deep history of productivity
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.520]   and how things sort of spun off their axis in knowledge work
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.360]   because you have to set up,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   like what is the issue we're trying to solve?
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.960]   And that's a big deal.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.560]   I think in knowledge work,
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.920]   there's a lot of people who correctly have the instinct
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.080]   that something is going wrong with productivity
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.920]   in knowledge work.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.600]   Like this push to do more is not generating more.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.720]   It's not sustainable.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.240]   It's stressing us out,
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.200]   but they're jumping past the what's going on
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.160]   to let me just start blasting at enemies
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.120]   'cause that's the whole tone, I think,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.560]   of online discourse right now.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.280]   So it's mustache twisting managers and capitalism
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.240]   and these sort of vague cultures of overwork.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   It's all very vague.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.800]   It's just so that you can kind of attack it.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.400]   And in my book, I'm like, yeah, great,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   but let's actually understand,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   like where do these,
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.760]   where's our notions of productivity come from
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.600]   and unstructured productivity plays a big role
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.440]   in that storyline.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.520]   The rise of unstructured productivity,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.720]   I've been developing this whole framework,
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.560]   which you'll hear more about in the future about,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   because I'm a tech guy,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.600]   how unstructured productivity kind of worked, wasn't great.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.520]   And then you get computers, it's body blow number one.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.720]   Then you get networks, body blow number two,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.280]   and the whole thing collapses.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.400]   So it's this cultural idea of,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.560]   God, I don't even know what productivity means
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.400]   in knowledge work.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.160]   I'll just like leave it up to the individual.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.960]   That was okay in like 1977.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.320]   You get to like 1997 and the whole thing falls apart.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.200]   And I think we're still on the mat right now
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.640]   trying to figure out what to do about it.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.920]   And so there's a whole interesting thing out there,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.360]   but it's an evolution because in my last book,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.200]   I talked specifically about one implication
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.320]   of unstructured productivity is the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.880]   So if productivity is unstructured,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.160]   collaboration in particular is gonna be ad hoc
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.240]   and back and forth with messages on Slack and email.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.200]   And so I wrote that whole book, "World Without Email"
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.800]   about just collaboration in the context
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.200]   of unstructured productivity is a brain melter.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.960]   It's a killer of like actually being able
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.140]   to get things done and it makes us all miserable,
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.120]   but that's just one issue of unstructured productivity.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.160]   So in my writing for "The New Yorker" and in this book,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.140]   the bigger issue in my mind is not just collaboration
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.000]   goes awry, but it's workload.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.200]   This like, you're always working,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   there's always more work to do.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.680]   There's performativity.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.200]   You're trying to signal value through low value actions,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.040]   through busyness.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.480]   Like this is the bigger, broader issue.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.560]   And that's the evolution of my thinking
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.220]   is like unstructured productivity.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.640]   You can't understand any complaint
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.680]   about modern knowledge work without starting
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.520]   with that issue.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.360]   - It's really cool.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.180]   - Yeah.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.520]   - It's really well explained too.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.360]   All right, so what I wanna do
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.480]   is I have a collection of questions
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.960]   that are all roughly speaking about this tension
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.520]   between business and relaxation,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.720]   getting after it and trying to recharge.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.580]   First, let me mention a sponsor
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.400]   that helps make this show possible.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.240]   That is my friends at 80,000 Hours.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.800]   80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that aims to help people
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.000]   have a positive impact with their career.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.240]   If you're wondering where that number comes from,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.880]   let's do a little math.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.520]   40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years of work,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.080]   you get the 80,000.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.120]   Now, when I say these are my friends,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.800]   I didn't mean that in the informal colloquial sense of,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.280]   oh, it's people that work with us.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.240]   I've known these guys from the very beginning.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.160]   Right, so I've known that they're based out of Oxford.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.040]   When they started this nonprofit,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.920]   I was working on what became my book,
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.160]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.920]   which is a book about career advice
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.200]   that pushes back on this idea
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.000]   that you should just follow your passion.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.720]   And so we were really simpatico.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.040]   So I know these guys, we talk back and forth.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.880]   They've written some guides about my work.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.960]   I've been talking about their work for a long time.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.200]   So I was really happy to have the opportunity
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.160]   for them to become one of our sponsors
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.280]   'cause it's people I already pitch positively.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.080]   So here's the idea behind this nonprofit, 80,000 hours.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.040]   It's what you spend the majority of your time doing
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.280]   is working.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   So it is your biggest tool you have
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   to make a difference in the world.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.000]   Now, most people who even bother
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.040]   to think about this question,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.260]   like what can I do with my work
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.720]   so that I leave the world a better place?
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.400]   Most people who try to think about this question
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.640]   feel like there's not very many options.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.120]   I think our normal discourse on this says like, what?
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.400]   You can become a doctor or go work for a nonprofit.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.360]   Like we have these really limited options
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.520]   and that's kind of it.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.880]   And so we have all of this generations of smart kids.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.540]   Like I don't wanna work for a nonprofit, become a doctor,
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.960]   and then they all become lawyers.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.040]   80,000 hours says, let's go deep on this question.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.880]   How do we help you connect your work,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.360]   the 80,000 hours you spend work
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.320]   into actually doing good for the world?
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.000]   They've spent at least 10 years now
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.200]   conducting research on this topic.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.340]   As I mentioned, affiliated with academics
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.360]   at Oxford University.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.040]   They know that our generation faces issues
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.140]   of historical importance,
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.020]   and they wanna help more of us dedicate
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.340]   their 80,000 hours of work to solve them.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.360]   So what you can do is you can go to their website,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.680]   80,000 hours, the number 80,000,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   followed by the word hours, 80,000hours.org/deep.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.440]   And they will send you a free copy
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.040]   of their in-depth career guide.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.920]   So this will just get you started
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.440]   on the 80,000 hours way of thinking about work.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.860]   In it, you will learn about what makes
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.520]   for a high impact career.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.820]   You will get new ideas for impactful paths.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.600]   It will also help you make a plan
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.760]   based on what you learned,
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.640]   a plan that will help you put those ideas into action.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   So in addition to getting that guide,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.320]   which will get you started,
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.580]   it will sign you up for their newsletter,
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.920]   which is gonna give you regular updates
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.340]   on their research and tell you
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.320]   about high impact job opportunities.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.200]   More recently, they've also started a podcast,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.480]   which is fantastic.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.760]   They've had a lot of great guests on there.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.000]   I mean, I'm just looking at some of their recent topics here.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.800]   So they had, for example,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.600]   a recent podcast on successful careers,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.580]   even if you have depression, anxiety, or imposter order.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.540]   They had David Chalmers on.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.700]   So if you know anything about AI or ethics,
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.980]   you know David Chalmers,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.740]   on the nature and ethics of consciousness.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.880]   So you get this mix of practicality and big think.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.600]   They also have a job board at 80,000hours.org
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   helping you find high impact jobs.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.440]   So look, if you wanna do something
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.700]   to make the world a better place,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.600]   your job is the best way to do it.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.880]   And going to 80,000hours.org/deep
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.580]   is how to get started figuring out
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.880]   how to inject impact into your working life.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.680]   So go to 80,000hours.org/deep
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.360]   to start planning a career that is meaningful,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.080]   fulfilling, and helps solve
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.240]   one of the world's most pressing problems.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.600]   It's really full circle, Jesse.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.800]   I mean, I knew those guys years ago.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.300]   - Yeah.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.240]   - I had my newsletter and they were just getting started
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.520]   and that was kind of it, you know?
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.700]   And now full circle, we have podcasts,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.500]   I can advertise them.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.820]   It's cool, I enjoy that.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.380]   I also wanna talk about my favorite URL to say,
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.380]   Zocdoc.com, Z-O-C-D-O-C dot com.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.980]   This is one of those services that makes so much sense
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.040]   that it almost doesn't even have to be pitched.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.260]   Like here's the situation,
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.920]   here's the problem that Zocdoc solves.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.060]   You need to go see some sort of medical professional.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.340]   Your tooth hurts, you need to see a dentist.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.400]   Your leg hurts, you need to see a doctor.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.700]   You don't have a doctor.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.780]   And you're like, what do I do next?
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.300]   It's classic adulting for all of the young ones out there.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.880]   Or for those of us like my age
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.520]   who have been up to their ears in kids
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.240]   and are like, I haven't had time to think about
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.700]   getting a cardiologist, how do I do that?
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.540]   What do you do?
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.820]   And most people Google or just start texting friends.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.900]   Do you have a doctor that you can recommend?
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.300]   This is a problem that would be well solved by an app.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.500]   And that is what Zocdoc does.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500]   It is the only free app that lets you find
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.720]   and book doctors who are patient reviews,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.560]   take your insurance and are available when you need them.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.500]   So you can immediately find, okay, I need a dentist.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.820]   Where are there dentists nearby that take my insurance
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.320]   and are looking for new patients?
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.300]   And let me sign up.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.080]   Oh wait, maybe before I sign up,
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.180]   I wanna see like, do I like this dentist?
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.860]   Well, here are real reviews.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.780]   Independent service Zocdoc.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.060]   Here's real reviews from real patients.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.500]   Ah, they really like her.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.540]   All right, and she's available and she takes my insurance.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.460]   Done.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.140]   You get the tooth pain taken care of.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.980]   So it's one of these ideas that just makes sense
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.340]   and Zocdoc does it well.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340]   As I've mentioned before,
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.480]   I have two different healthcare providers right now
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.760]   where they use Zocdoc to handle all of their paperwork.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.100]   So when I'm going in,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.380]   I can just do it online before I go in.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.300]   I can fill out whatever new forms they need,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.820]   click a button.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.720]   I love it.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.940]   So Zocdoc plays a big role in my life as well.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.380]   So go to zocdoc.com/deep
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.700]   and download the Zocdoc app for free.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.780]   Then find a book, a top rated doctor today.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.820]   Many are available within 24 hours.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.060]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.740]   Zocdoc.com/deep.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.500]   Was it?
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.660]   Last time we figured out, Jessie,
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.500]   we're trying to figure out
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.060]   how can we get more ox into the URL?
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.900]   What was our winner?
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.900]   The winner was if Dwayne Johnson did a podcast
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.760]   about building berths for your boats.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.840]   And so he had the promo code.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.440]   His vanity URL would be rockstock.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.060]   So you get zocdoc.com/rockstock.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.280]   I think that was the best we got to.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.700]   We need one more in there.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.560]   One more in there.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.880]   But anyways, zocdoc.com.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.640]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.120]   As mentioned, these are all roughly speaking
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.640]   about the theme of this week's episode,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.160]   which is how do I stop working all out all the time?
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.200]   All right, Jessie, what do we have
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.440]   as our first question here?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.400]   - Oh, we got some good questions here.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.320]   First is from Fork in the Road.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.020]   I'm currently working in higher education administration
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.240]   at a rural university.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.600]   My lifestyle is slow and I have a lot of free time,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.760]   which I enjoy.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.880]   However, my income is quite low.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.560]   Many of my peers with similar degrees
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.200]   have moved on to data science or software engineering,
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.760]   live in big cities and have fast paced lives.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.140]   They are definitely pros and cons of both lifestyles.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.440]   And I don't really see a good way of choosing.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.420]   - Well, first of all, and I think data scientists,
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.200]   I think fast paced lives.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.040]   - Yeah.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.800]   - They're just slinging hundreds, you know,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.260]   cocaine all hours of the night,
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:46.060]   pulling up in their Kawasaki Ninja motorcycles,
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.720]   slapping five.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.360]   The data scientists do it in the standard deviation.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.680]   I don't know, I'm trying to think what's on their shirt.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.600]   I'm pretty clever.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.660]   So here's what I'm doing here, Jessie.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.040]   This is an inversion, right?
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.760]   So we were talking about people who were working too much
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.920]   and wondering how they can maybe make that more sustainable.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.180]   Let's invert that with this question.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.540]   Someone who's not working enough
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.900]   or not working that much at all
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.340]   and wondering if they should be working more,
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.420]   but how do they do that in a way
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.700]   that's not going to overwhelm them?
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.940]   So how do they find that?
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.380]   How do they get to that mean we're looking for?
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.540]   They're coming out from another direction,
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.220]   but trying to end up in that same place,
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.320]   having the right level of work.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.100]   So as long-time listeners know,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.780]   my standard answer to any of these
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.140]   should I change my job questions
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.560]   usually comes back to lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160]   I say, look, you should have this clear vision
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.860]   of your ideal lifestyle, all aspects of your life,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.540]   not just work.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.780]   It should be tangible.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.540]   You can smell it, taste it, see it, feel it.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.020]   And then you figure out how do I work backwards from that
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.260]   to make it happen, given whatever opportunities, skills,
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.140]   existing career capital I have in place.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.180]   And then you sort of build a reasonable plan
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.760]   to get closer to that vision.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.100]   This question brings another element into that discussion,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.580]   which I think is important,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.780]   which is the notion of an income floor.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.700]   So lifestyles and lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.780]   are abstracted away from details of
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.500]   this is your particular job.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.100]   This is your particular income.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.900]   But we cannot abstract income completely
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.140]   out of these discussions
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.580]   because if your income is below a certain level,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.900]   there are issues that could arise
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   that will destabilize any aspirational lifestyle goal.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.060]   There's a stress generation factor that happens.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.980]   If you feel like you don't have enough discretionary income
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.460]   to handle the things that come up
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.980]   in the normal course of life,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.020]   it is a constant source of stress.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.620]   And it doesn't matter if, yeah, but my house nearby,
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.380]   this rural university has a nice yard and it's scenic.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.300]   And if you're worried about money all the time,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.980]   that stress is going to outweigh that.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.840]   Also, if discretionary income is low enough,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.460]   so many of the different options you have
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.780]   for actually investing in and fulfilling visions
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.700]   for different areas of your life
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.540]   are gonna be cut off to you.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.420]   I can't take this time off.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.900]   I can't afford to do this.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.880]   I don't have the money to buy the mountain bike
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.100]   for my dream of mountain biking.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.060]   So there's something that I call the income floor,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.300]   which is important.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.460]   And that's where you take,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.460]   and I'm using this term discretionary income.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.140]   What I really mean by that is your income
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.000]   after fixed expenses.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.300]   So now we're trying to normalize
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.580]   for like how much does your house cost?
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.500]   You know, how much,
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.740]   you have to pay tuition for private school for your kids
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.580]   because of where you live,
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.740]   that's the best option, et cetera.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.700]   So the money you have left over,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.220]   if that's below a certain floor,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.660]   which you can conceptually figure out,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.260]   then a particular lifestyle plan,
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.620]   we can think of as being unsustainable.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.500]   So it's like, you wanna say, here's my lifestyle vision.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.260]   How do I, using my existing opportunities
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.140]   and skills and options,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.460]   how do I get closer to this lifestyle
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.540]   while staying above my income floor?
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.620]   And we wanna throw that into the discussion here
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.780]   fork in the road, because you said,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.460]   my income is also quite low.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.860]   So this is actually gonna be the crux of what you do next
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.580]   is figuring out does low, quite low
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.660]   mean below your income floor.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.300]   And it's another bit of planning you have to do.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.420]   How much money would you need
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.700]   after you pay for your housing expenses, et cetera?
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.700]   How much discretionary income do you think you would need
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.500]   to feel non-stressed and like you have interesting options
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.460]   and the various things that matter for you in your life?
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.420]   If in your current job, you're below that,
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.260]   getting above that income floor is a necessary component
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.380]   of your lifestyle vision that you're trying to move towards.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.020]   Now you might find that you're already above it.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.140]   Yeah, you don't make a ton of money,
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.260]   but where you live is cheap and it's fine.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.220]   Good benefits, you're not really worried about
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   calamitous whatever health occurrences.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.180]   So you might be fine,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.880]   or you might feel that you're close to it,
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.600]   but everything else about your lifestyle
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.440]   where you live is good.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.260]   Well, that's fine.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.420]   Now you're just trying to close an income gap
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.020]   and you can make a plan to do that.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.220]   I wanna move up to this next level in the administration.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.580]   I'm gonna do this thing on the side
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.460]   because I have a data science background
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.980]   and I'm gonna do some side work
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.820]   and we can easily push that above.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.500]   Or you're gonna have to make a change and say,
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.820]   you know what, I'm well below it.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.620]   There's nothing I can really do here to get above it.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.620]   So I'm gonna have to make a change.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.500]   So the income floor, I think is really important.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.320]   If you do make a change,
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.340]   I wanna assure you that there is a middle ground
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.740]   between being the administrator in the rural university
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.220]   and big city, fast paced,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.940]   cliched data scientists doing Coke
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.740]   off the stomach of a stripper vision
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.000]   that we all have of you data scientists.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.140]   There is an in-between ground.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.180]   And how do you access that?
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.420]   What is the map you use to find the in-between ground?
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.860]   It's again, it's this lifestyle center,
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.360]   career planning augmented with the income floor.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.060]   If you have software engineering skills,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.060]   if you have data science skills,
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.260]   you can figure out, okay,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.280]   I don't need to make all of this money.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.620]   I need to get above this floor.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.460]   Oh, you know what?
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.900]   I could go to Boise and work at the tech sector there
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.740]   that's burgeoning.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.160]   And this is actually a pretty reasonable job,
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.500]   but it gives me above that floor
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.020]   and it still has some of the aspect I like
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.100]   of rural living over here.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.000]   When you have a lot of options is what I'm saying.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.500]   There might be remote work options.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.460]   Well, I could take this remote work job
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.920]   or I could do contract work.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.760]   And you know what?
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.060]   If I had five clients doing contract work,
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.900]   I'm above the floor, but I could live wherever I wanted,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.220]   but the income is better.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.600]   You have a lot of options.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.100]   And this is why I always come back to working backwards
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.540]   from your vision is because that's what allows you
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.780]   to navigate the territory of options.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.820]   Without that, we fall back on cliches.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.620]   We fall back on extremes.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.780]   Without that sort of guidance,
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:43.380]   we think I either become a lawyer or I become a teacher.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.680]   This is a standard Ivy League graduate thing.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.540]   Or you think I either move to the big city
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.660]   to be a software engineer and I have to somehow
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.920]   like afford to live in the Bay Area,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.860]   or I have to stay in a very low income administrator job
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.260]   in this rural county.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.460]   We think about extremes.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.580]   We think about cliches.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.260]   If we don't have a specific compass to navigate us
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.300]   through that territory.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.960]   So lifestyle vision, career planning with an income floor
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.260]   as a non-negotiable component of wherever you end up,
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.980]   I think you have many more options than you think.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.100]   You have many more knobs to turn with the degree you have
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.900]   to build that lifestyle than you might at first imagine.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.060]   - Mr. Money Mustache sent out an email kind of like moving
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.700]   or he was visited San Francisco
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.060]   and talked about some of those issues.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.900]   - What was his, he came away from visiting San Francisco
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.300]   saying the lifestyle here is so expensive,
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.140]   why would you live here?
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.980]   Or he came away saying, I'm moving to San Francisco.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.860]   - He came away saying he did some research
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.620]   and he's like, there's still a lot of cool things
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.460]   you can do in the city.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.740]   The food is actually not that much more expensive
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.140]   if you buy it in a grocery store.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.980]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.940]   - Because there's a lot of free places you can go
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.380]   and he took pictures of him in the parks
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.340]   and certain places and walking around,
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.640]   not paying for gas, that sort of thing.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.220]   - Here's my, I'm gonna give a deep poll here
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:01.220]   for like really long time denizens of online culture,
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.220]   especially old blog culture.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.540]   I'm talking early 2000s here.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.980]   This reminds me of it.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.220]   Leo Babuda, Zen Habits.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.300]   Did you know Zen Habits?
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.140]   - No.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.660]   - So this was really, he helped kick off this.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.020]   So there's this online minimalism movement
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.900]   that really kicked off pre-social media.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.340]   So these were, when I was getting started,
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.100]   these sites like Zen Habits were a couple years ahead of me.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.340]   In fact, Leo of Zen Habits actually had a program
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.060]   where you could sign up and he would mentor you
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.100]   as an early blogger.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.700]   He mentored me for a while and gave me some advice.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.820]   So I remember being in grad school at MIT
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.180]   in the early 2000s, like 2005, 2006, reading Zen Habits.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.100]   This is when the minimalists got started a little later,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.780]   but this was also the time of becoming minimalists.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.820]   And I don't remember all of them.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.580]   They all had minimalism in the name, basically.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.540]   Courtney Carver, I'm trying to think of the different names.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.620]   Anyways, it was this whole movement about simplifying.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.160]   And it really was, I wrote about this
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.420]   in my quiet quitting piece for the New Yorker
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.020]   a couple of weeks ago, about, briefly I mentioned,
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.180]   to the millennials like us, this minimalism movement
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:15.060]   that arose after 9/11, during the financial crisis of 2008,
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.900]   that whole first decade of the 2000s
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.980]   was really millennials trying to grapple with work and life.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.700]   And it's when we were moving away from follow your passion.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.540]   We were the first generation raised on that,
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.080]   to trying to figure out, how do I put work to work on behalf
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.020]   of what I want my life to be?
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.900]   But anyways, Leo was one of the original guys.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.420]   Zen Habits was about simplifying your life, slowing down.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.420]   And he lived in Guam, six kids, was in debt,
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.980]   and was out of shape and smoking or whatever.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.780]   And through Zen Habits, he began chronicling.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.020]   He got in better shape, he stopped smoking,
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.300]   built up this audience, and wrote a guide.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.420]   I forgot even what it was called,
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.740]   but like a PDF guide, and started selling it.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.100]   And that did really well by 2005 standards.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.740]   Today, when you think about someone doing well,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.580]   we're like, oh, that's great.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.180]   Jordan Harbinger signed a $5 million podcast deal.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.020]   This was more like, man, I made $70,000 or something.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.140]   But he paid off all of his debts.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.340]   And what made me think about this story,
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.180]   based on what you're talking about,
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.680]   is they moved to San Francisco.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.380]   All his six kids, he quit his job,
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.100]   he could make just enough off of this,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.700]   and they lived really cheaply.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.900]   So it reminds me exactly what
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.820]   Mr. Money Mustache was talking about.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.220]   He wanted to live somewhere interesting.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.700]   So they moved to a row house in San Francisco,
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.180]   they homeschooled their kids,
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.340]   and just went to the parks and to the ocean,
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.640]   and just walked around, and just loved,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.980]   their whole life was built around
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.500]   just being in an interesting place.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.300]   So it made me think about that.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.500]   He was living cheap, and made a really cool life.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.340]   So he's like, if we're gonna live cheap,
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.260]   we wanna live somewhere that's fascinating.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.900]   Zen Habits, that guy was awesome.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.060]   You would read that, and you would just be like,
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.540]   man, I gotta simplify my life.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   That's a good movement.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.340]   All the older, I have listeners out there
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.180]   who know what I'm talking about,
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.780]   but that was a cool, little cool period in our culture.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.220]   That then morphed into fire culture,
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.460]   into Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.460]   So fire was the follow-up to the online minimalism movement.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.380]   So fire was more like a geeky version of that.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.640]   So the minimalism movement had the Minimalist,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.060]   and Leo, and Courtney, and Joshua Becker,
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.420]   and these guys were, they're kinda cool.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.220]   It was kinda, they're cooler guys,
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.260]   like we're gonna just hike with our backpack,
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.620]   and live simply, and Josh and Ryan
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.300]   moved to a cabin for a while.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.820]   And then we got the new version,
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.480]   which Mr. Money Mustache helped kick off.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.780]   And now it's more geeks.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.000]   Here, my spreadsheet tells me that
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.460]   if I get a 3.6 return post-tax on my SEP IRA,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.300]   I'm gonna be able to retire.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.780]   So then there was this kind of geek version of it,
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.100]   but it was all the same idea.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.460]   And then the fire movement kinda got shut down,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.420]   because, I mean, it's still around,
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.100]   but they got super shamed.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.020]   So then they got super shamed of like,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.820]   you guys all are privileged, and this and that,
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:01.980]   and they all got worried about it,
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.540]   and so a lot of them kinda disappeared.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.900]   And I don't know what's gonna come next,
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.460]   but that's a whole other conversation.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.700]   All right, let's do another question here.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.780]   - Daniel, do you think there's a need for a place
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.820]   where people can go for prolonged periods
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.100]   to perform deep work?
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.540]   A space close to nature,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.540]   where you have your dedicated habitat,
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.600]   are surrounded by like-minded individuals,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.620]   and have some things taken care of for you?
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.100]   - Daniel, these things very much do exist.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.740]   In fact, it's one of my great hobbies,
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.540]   when I'm feeling stressed out,
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.100]   is to track down or luxuriate in examples
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.600]   of exactly these type of settings,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.300]   places that are designed to help people do deep work
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.500]   in the most scenic or novel possible environment,
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.460]   with distractions minimized as much as possible.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.180]   So these exist all over the place,
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.260]   aimed at different people for different situations.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.760]   I thought I would take advantage of this question
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.220]   to do a little bit of deep geeking, as I like to call it.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.940]   I pulled up on my tablet here,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.180]   just a few examples of these places among many.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.380]   So if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   you can see these pictures,
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.220]   but I'll describe what I'm showing
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.980]   for people who are just listening.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.740]   All right, so this first example I brought up here, BMC,
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:16.100]   this is the Blue Mountain Center.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.380]   This is near Blue Mountain Lake in the Adirondacks.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.260]   So those who are watching see a beautiful Adirondack lodge,
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:29.080]   that's logs with ceilings that come down low,
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.720]   that's part of a 1,600 acre estate.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.460]   So here it says, "Life at BMC is centered
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.700]   "around our guest work, rejuvenation, and communal life.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.800]   "The atmosphere is informal, cooperative, and curious.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.180]   "People come here to write.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.460]   "They get away from everything."
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.060]   I know about this particular center
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.440]   because Bill McKibben, one of my icons,
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.260]   my hero, the writer Bill McKibben, he went here.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.220]   I discovered this when I interviewed Bill
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.700]   for a New Yorker column a year or so ago.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.660]   I was asking him about how he ended up,
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.940]   because his story, if you don't know it,
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.540]   is that he was a writer, lived in Manhattan,
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.680]   was a writer for the New Yorker,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.520]   living in this small apartment downtown.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.500]   And it wasn't a super safe area, right?
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.060]   It was definitely a living in a city experience.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.300]   And he told me about his apartment getting broken into
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.280]   at some point, and there was nothing for them to steal.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.700]   Like they broke in, or like, "What am I taking?
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.580]   "There's nothing here."
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.020]   So he was living the city life,
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.580]   and he was on track to be an editor at the New Yorker.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.340]   In fact, Bill Shawn had even hinted at the idea
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:35.340]   that he may be even replace him as the editor-in-chief.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.880]   So he was on this fast track,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.100]   and he quit and moved to a cabin in the Adirondacks.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.380]   And him and his wife, Susan Halpern,
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.500]   who also writes for the New Yorker,
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.180]   still to this day, great writer,
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.100]   they moved up to the Adirondacks,
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.540]   and he wrote a book about nature.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.960]   He's like, "I wanna do nature writing,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.400]   "and I'm gonna live cheaply."
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.660]   So speaking of minimalism, speaking of fire,
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.680]   his whole thing was, "We can live up here for almost nothing.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.620]   "So with just book advances and random freelance work,
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.460]   "we can support ourselves, and we just live this simple life."
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.900]   And he's still up there today.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.420]   He moved across the Lake Champlain to Vermont,
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.440]   but same idea.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.780]   Anyways, why did he move to the Adirondacks?
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.700]   I interviewed him about this.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.900]   He said, "I didn't know anything about the Adirondacks
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.500]   "until a year before that quitting event,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.980]   "a friend of his had a spot at the Blue Mountain Center
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.460]   "in Blue Lake Mountain in the Adirondacks
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.400]   "for a multi-week writing retreat,
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.580]   "and the friend dropped out and said,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.300]   "Hey, Bill, do you wanna take my spot?"
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.020]   So he just took his spot.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.380]   It showed up at this place sight unseen.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.340]   For those who are watching,
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.240]   I'm showing other aspirational photos here.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.060]   A lake that the house is looking over,
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.260]   people baking bread.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.860]   Here's a whole thing about, oh, look at this.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.260]   Oh, Jesse, look at this.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.140]   Cell phones are not allowed at Blue Mountain Center.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.360]   I'm loving this place more.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.340]   If I disappear for a few months and you can't find me,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.460]   go to the Blue Mountain Center.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.620]   It's probably gonna find me.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.860]   Here's riders hiking.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.980]   You see, they all have sort of the pasty skin of riders
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.880]   that have been inside too long.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.100]   Here they are sitting by a dock.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.220]   Here is, now, Jesse, you can correct me
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.140]   if in my description here is a forest,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.900]   and there's a silhouetted figure,
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.620]   I believe that's Sasquatch, right?
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.440]   There's a silhouette.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.860]   It looks like a bear standing on his hind legs.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.700]   I mean, do I have that right?
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.520]   Is that just me?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   It looks like a bear, right?
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.380]   - Yeah, it does. - Yeah.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.940]   So like downside of Blue Mountain Center,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.380]   you may be eaten by a Sasquatch,
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.060]   but upside, there's good bread, no cell phones.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.420]   Anyways, that's one example among many.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.800]   Let me show another quick example here.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.640]   I love this one.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.620]   I don't know if they're doing this anymore.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.460]   The pandemic might've killed it,
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.980]   but for a while, I thought this was really cool.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.540]   And this is the Amtrak Riders Residency.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.860]   So it was a program where as a rider, you apply,
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.300]   you say, "I'm stuck on my book."
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:54.300]   And what they give you is a berth on a sleeper car
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.900]   for Amtrak from New York to Portland, Oregon.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.540]   So a multi-day Amtrak train.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.580]   I'm showing some photos of this on the screen.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.380]   And so there's no distractions.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.060]   You're just in a cross-country Amtrak train,
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.740]   and all you can do is sort of write and think.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.180]   You're literally stuck on this particular train.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.780]   - It's quiet the entire time?
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.900]   - Quiet the entire time.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.140]   - Quiet cabin the entire time?
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.380]   - Well, you have your own room.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.820]   - Oh, okay. - You got your own car.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.580]   I just took the Amtrak.
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.700]   I went up to New York real quick for a photo shoot.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.220]   Was not in the quiet car.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.100]   The person next to me, and like, I don't,
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.520]   it's not the quiet car.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.180]   And I get if you have a phone call to make.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.740]   This person was just straight up watching content
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.260]   on their phone with no earphones.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.900]   Just straight up, the volume, like,
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.900]   I don't know what they're, the video or something like that.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.060]   - Did you move?
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.180]   - Yeah, it was a full train.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.380]   - Full train.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.940]   - So what are you gonna do?
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:45.780]   - I don't mind.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.600]   I just read.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.440]   It was nice.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.260]   All right, one more example to give.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.100]   This is near us.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.700]   Most people don't know about this in DC.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.080]   So there's a Franciscan monastery associated with,
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.420]   I think with Catholic University here in DC.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.120]   And they have this, if you look on the screen,
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.540]   it's like a teeny house,
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.220]   like a modernist small structure in the woods.
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.140]   This is on the grounds of a monastery right here
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.260]   in this inside DC, inside the Beltway,
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.060]   maybe like 20 minutes from where Jesse and I are right now.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.340]   Anyways, you can book time to just go stay in this thing.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.720]   So it's in the city, but in the woods,
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.560]   they have all this land.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.140]   It's like in the woods, but in the middle of the city.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:25.560]   And they say you can enter into deeper communion with God
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.040]   through prayer and solitude.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.620]   It's an urban retreat for one person nestled behind
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.720]   a historic Franciscan monastery of the Holy Land in America.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.780]   But I'll tell you what, a lot of writers go here.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.800]   So you can commune with God,
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.940]   but you can also get some writing done.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.080]   It has one bed, a kitchenette, a bathroom,
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.680]   and an outdoor deck.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.620]   And that's it.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.580]   There's a video about it you can watch.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.720]   Anyways, people don't know about that,
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.980]   but right here in DC, one to seven nights,
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.100]   you just write the monks and they're like,
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.860]   "Hey, I want to come and do this."
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.380]   And if they approve it, you just in this box,
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.780]   this modernist box with a bed.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.380]   And it's like, you can be like a monk for a while
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.220]   and get writing done.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.060]   So Daniel, there are lots of options.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.580]   And there should be more,
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.380]   but there's a lot of options out there.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.540]   If you're looking to get away,
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.240]   especially if you're a writer or an artist,
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.580]   there are a lot of options and I think they're cool.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.180]   All right, let's move on.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.260]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.300]   - All right, next question is from TJ.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.020]   How do I find time to work deeply
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.660]   when I'm a busy college student?
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.260]   - So, I mean, this is a college student question,
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.140]   but I think it's relevant to everyone.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.180]   So I don't do, I try not to do
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.260]   student specific questions anymore
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.540]   where it's just relevant to students.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.900]   But I think actually this issue
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.940]   that is being brought up here by TJ
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:39.380]   is relevant to more than just students,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   which is this idea of I am too busy to do deep work.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.580]   All right, here's the thing.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:50.160]   You have the core work you have to do.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.440]   So TJ, you're a college student.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.180]   So there's assignments that have to be done,
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.140]   papers have to be written,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.740]   studying that has to be completed for quizzes and exams.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.980]   That work is your work you need to do.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.860]   So the question is just how are you gonna do it?
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.260]   Now, if you do it in the deep style,
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.820]   which is let me focus without distraction
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.660]   when I'm doing that work,
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.380]   and when I'm not doing that work, not be doing that work,
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.660]   or you could do it in a shallow style
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.560]   where you mix it in with lots of other things.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.140]   The deep style will take less time.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.800]   So I don't really understand the underlying premise
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.560]   of I'm too busy to do deep work
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.860]   if that's actually the most efficient way
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.300]   just from a pure time consumption perspective
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.260]   to get things done.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.020]   So let's reinterpret this question another way,
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.100]   which is I have too much going on to get my core work done.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.020]   This is sometimes what people say
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.340]   when they say I'm too busy to do deep work.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.500]   What they really mean is I'm too busy,
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.560]   my schedule is too crowded with the shallow
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.420]   to actually make progress on the core things
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.300]   I need to do in my job,
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   whether it be a college student having to study for a test,
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.440]   or it's you're working in a business
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.260]   and it's doing your core business strategy, whatever it is.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.940]   Well, in that case, here's what you do.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.980]   You take out your calendar,
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.500]   you build an autopilot schedule.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.340]   This is what I tell students and it works for everyone else.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.980]   Everything that occurs regularly,
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.260]   I always have to do reading each week.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.140]   I always have to do a problem set.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.020]   You find a time for it this day, this time,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.100]   week after week, and you block it off on your calendar.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.020]   So everything regular gets time.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.220]   And when you get to the beginning of your week,
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.060]   you do a weekly plan for that week.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.940]   And if you're having trouble fitting things,
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.780]   do a weekly plan that's very heavy on time allocation.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.060]   Let me actually find time on my calendar
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.980]   for all the major things I have to get done.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.660]   You don't always do this in weekly planning in general,
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.020]   but if you're feeling busy and overwhelmed,
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.420]   let's do this for a little while.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.580]   So now you're placing,
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.780]   okay, I gotta work on this term paper.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:39.140]   I gotta get these notes cleaned up, whatever.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.140]   Getting that all in your calendar.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.340]   And either fits or it doesn't.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.340]   If it doesn't fit, you only have two options.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.780]   You can make more room by quitting things.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.500]   So if you're a student, this might mean forget this club.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.940]   I can't be involved in these six things.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.020]   If you have another type of job,
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.940]   it might be your project load.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.300]   I gotta leave this committee.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.860]   I gotta get off of this project.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.500]   I have to postpone this until the summer
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.140]   because it's just a reality, right?
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:03.980]   You need more time.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.820]   You gotta clear up more time.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.500]   The second option you have is to get the work
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.900]   you have done more efficiently.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:09.740]   So if you're a student,
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.940]   you could start using the more efficient study techniques
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.020]   I talk about, for example, in my book,
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.780]   how to become a straight A student,
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:20.420]   or in the archives of my blog at calnewport.com.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:24.700]   You can go back to 2007, 2008, get a lot of articles on it.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.740]   That makes things take less time.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.140]   You can take things off your calendar to free up more time.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.460]   Those are your two options.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.900]   You gotta face the productivity dragon here
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.340]   and figure out what your strategy is gonna be.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.620]   There is no other third option where the work gets done
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.420]   by just you ignoring it and saying,
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.300]   stop bothering me about things like deep work.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.340]   I'm just too busy.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.220]   So you gotta face the reality of your schedule
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.420]   by autopiloting and doing heavy time allocation weekly plans.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   Look at what you're facing.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.060]   If it doesn't fit, you have those two weapons
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:54.900]   and you have to deploy them to whatever extent is required
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.780]   to make this schedule reasonable.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   Keep in mind that might entail radical changes.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.180]   The college student equivalent of,
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.780]   I can't be a double major and I'm gonna use these credits
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.700]   so I can reduce my course load
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.180]   and I gotta quit three clubs.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.060]   It might be whatever equivalent that is for your job,
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.860]   but your schedule is your schedule.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.500]   And getting to the theme of this episode,
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.100]   if you just say, I'll just get after it, I'll work late,
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.260]   I'll work on the weekends, we'll somehow make this work,
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.340]   you're gonna burn out.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.740]   Sustainability is the key.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.740]   And this is how you begin to fight more for sustainability
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.820]   at the scale of the schedule.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.020]   If this doesn't fit in a reasonable way,
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.220]   I have to make changes.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.620]   All right, I wanna do a case study.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.580]   So when you send in your questions for the show,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.980]   you can also opt to send in case studies
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.380]   of advice working well.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.660]   All right, well, this case study comes from Ayaz,
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.580]   a 28 year old engineer.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:53.100]   Ayaz writes, "My wife is a surgical resident
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.060]   and as part of her training,
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.060]   she had to complete a five week rotation in Anchorage, Alaska.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.820]   My company was open to me working remotely
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.420]   on a temporary basis, so I went with her.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.980]   While there, instead of working from home,
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.560]   I decided to rent a coworking space 1.5 miles away.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.820]   This was around May to June.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.340]   And I remember you talking about the concept
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.340]   of working from your home,
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.180]   and this is exactly what I was doing.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.140]   Separating work from home made intuitive sense to me.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.900]   Boundaries are important.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.140]   They allow you to give shape to life.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.520]   The cowork was a quiet 15 minute walk away.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.980]   This allowed me to get in the mindset of working.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:28.940]   You know, some parentheses,
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.940]   I would often listen to deep questions on these walks.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.540]   That's a smart thing to do.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.300]   The slow walk in your podcast would help prime my mind
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.160]   to focus intensely while working.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.400]   Between meetings to transition from one product to another
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.340]   or relax my nerves,
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.060]   I would also walk in the downtown Anchorage
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.460]   and grab a cup of coffee.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.660]   It was a perfect way to get some thinking done
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.060]   or mentally shift focus from one project to another.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.240]   I also realized the profound impact mountains have
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.040]   on my experience of depth.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.860]   The short stay in that city and working from your home
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.900]   has convinced me my vision of the deep life
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.460]   includes living close to the mountains
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.040]   and preferably walking to work.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.740]   So I like this case study for a particular reason
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.580]   I want to emphasize,
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.800]   but first I want to fact check something here, Jesse.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:15.740]   I'm reading IS as saying he's 1.5 miles from his office
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:20.220]   and then he gets there in 15 minutes walking.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.100]   - He's walking pretty fast.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.220]   - That's a fast walk.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.040]   - Yeah.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.060]   - I think that might be an impossibly fast walk.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.840]   A moderate paced walk is about 20 minutes to a mile.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.580]   1.5 miles.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.420]   I think he maybe he meant 0.5 miles
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.500]   or and I think this is equally likely he's 11 feet tall.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.860]   Good if you've figured out the stride length,
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.860]   I actually think that would work out just about right.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.860]   I mean, I think the engineers among us can figure that out,
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.980]   but I think that would,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.340]   having a double length stride would probably get you down
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.500]   to roughly a moderate walking pace of a 10 minute mile.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.980]   So 1.5 miles, 15 minutes.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.940]   So IS is 11 feet tall.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.580]   The thing I wanted to point out from this
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.020]   is the theme of this episode,
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:08.320]   which is trying to combat burnout by having,
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.740]   finding this balance between intensity and non-intensity.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.360]   It's not just about time.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.220]   I have busy periods and non-busy periods.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.320]   I have this many hours of work
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.500]   versus that many hours of work.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.940]   I'm looking at my schedule like with TJ
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.660]   and I'm figuring out does it fit or not?
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.540]   And if it doesn't fit, I need to take things out
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.260]   or make things smaller.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   Location also plays a role in the intensity of your work.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.340]   Finding the separation that I has found.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.740]   Here's my home, here's my office.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.640]   And I have a ritual about how I transition
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.480]   from one to another.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.960]   And during the day, I can leave the office
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.500]   and see the mountains and walk in the downtown Anchorage
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.620]   and get a cup of coffee.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.780]   The location can shift, location to recharge,
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.140]   location to transition from home to work.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.980]   That will have a huge impact on the feeling of intensity
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.140]   of your actual effort.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.640]   So location can matter just as much as time.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.600]   This is something I don't think we thought enough about
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.740]   during the knowledge workers who had to go remote
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.100]   during the pandemic, especially those who lived in places
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.980]   where that remoteness lasted for a really long time.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.940]   We didn't think enough about location.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.200]   We said, technically speaking,
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.580]   my laptop in my bedroom gives me all I need.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.020]   And what we should have been saying is,
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.820]   but what is my soul need to actually get this work done
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.660]   in a sustainable way?
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.140]   I need to get out of this house.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.100]   I need to be in whatever, a deep work shed in the backyard,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.180]   or this is a time, you know, because I'm lucky enough
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.340]   to have a stable knowledge work job
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.760]   that's not going away during the pandemic.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.420]   We're not spending money on anything else.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.300]   We're not going on vacation.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.340]   Great, I'm gonna lease an office space for this year.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.380]   So I have some place to go.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.940]   Like we should have cared more about that.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.420]   And I wanna hear what IAS does
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.900]   once they get back to where they are before.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.340]   Are they gonna move somewhere with mountains?
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.620]   Are they gonna have a walk to work?
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.840]   It's exciting to me.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.760]   Lifestyle-centered career planning is unfolding here,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   Jesse, he had experiences that built a richer understanding
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.900]   of what he wanted his lifestyle to be like.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.240]   And now he has this crystal clear image,
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.280]   which he can use to guide.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.160]   So he needs location matters, where they live,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.520]   like that really is gonna narrow down their search
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.080]   and open up some really interesting opportunities.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.040]   So we got two things out of this,
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.100]   an emphasis on the importance of location,
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.960]   and injecting some slowness into your life,
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.520]   and a cool case study in how really good
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.160]   lifestyle-centered career planning plans emerge.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.080]   Let me do one more quick question here
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.800]   before we move on to something interesting.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.780]   This one comes from Anonymous.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.040]   Oh, you should read this, Jesse, I'm sorry.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.440]   I'm stepping on your toes here.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.360]   - No problem.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.720]   This comes from Anonymous.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.400]   Can you elaborate more on the celebration bucket?
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.240]   Is it definite?
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.760]   Its definition seemed more elusive to me.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.080]   - Right, so we talked about the deep life.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.360]   We talk about, you have to focus on all aspects on your life
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.480]   when trying to find depth, focusing on what's important
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.240]   and minimizing or limiting things that aren't.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.960]   And we often use the term buckets to talk about
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.560]   the different aspects of your life that are important.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.720]   I like to alliteratively refer to C,
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.680]   words that begin with C, when naming my buckets,
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.400]   and we had craft, and we had community,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.200]   and we have contemplation, and we have constitution.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.080]   And the last one I often talk about is celebration.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.120]   Anonymous is saying, what does that mean?
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.480]   So roughly speaking, Anonymous,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.780]   when I think about celebration,
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.840]   I think about cool things in the world,
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.280]   appreciating cool things in the world
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.680]   unrelated to your work.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.640]   I think you can break that down
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   into two specific subcategories, hobbies and gratitude.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.400]   So this is, celebration includes things you do
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.160]   just for the pure non-functional value of doing them.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.120]   I'm really into film.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   I hike, I'm into whatever, alpine, ice climbing,
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.580]   whatever it is, these interests you develop
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.220]   that you can appreciate and find great value in
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.660]   that have nothing to do with your job.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.780]   It's non-instrumental.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.460]   Also captures gratitude.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.020]   So celebration is about, do I have on a regular basis
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.900]   gratitude for things that I'm looking forward to
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.740]   or enjoy about my life right now?
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.460]   Do I have that in my life on a regular basis?
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.740]   I think it's important, for example,
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.880]   to regularly engineer experiences of gratitude
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   into your life.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.480]   I'm actually putting aside time.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.640]   I'm gonna go for a walk.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.440]   I'm gonna get home from work a little early.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.720]   I'm gonna go for a walk with the sunset.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.440]   And I'm gonna think about some things
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.520]   I really am grateful for right now
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.840]   and this nice, relaxing weekend that's coming up.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.320]   And I'm really looking forward to it
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.680]   and just generate that sense of gratitude.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.780]   I do that a lot.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.800]   I started doing that in grad school.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.280]   So I even refer to these experiences now internally
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.120]   as Cambridge moments.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.160]   'Cause I used to engineer gratitude a lot
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.760]   when I was in grad school at MIT.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.360]   But then I picked that up,
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.000]   especially in the winter, I like to do this a lot.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.800]   As the days get a little bit longer,
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.000]   I like, look, we still have sun in the sky
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.360]   and it's only gonna get brighter as the season goes on.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.060]   And the snow is kind of scenic.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.440]   And engineered gratitude,
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.940]   that's part of the celebration bucket as well.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.800]   So your hobbies and gratitude,
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.280]   that all falls on the celebration.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.680]   Those are two aspects of your life that require emphasis.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.080]   Start with a habit and then when you get around to it,
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.920]   overhaul that whole part of your life.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.720]   I'm answering that question in this episode
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.300]   because the celebration bucket is a great bulwark
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.760]   against the craft bucket
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.180]   pushing you towards too much busyness,
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.920]   towards too much intensity.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.160]   It is a bulwark against overwork and burnout
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.440]   because it is things that are non-instrumental, enjoyment.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.800]   There's something fundamentally slow about a hobby
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.960]   while enjoy something slow
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.440]   about an engineer gratitude experience.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.840]   So I think if we're gonna think about
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.120]   how to inject more slowness
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.400]   into an otherwise overloaded life,
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.360]   keep the celebration bucket very much in mind.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.040]   All right, we're gonna conclude things
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.020]   with something interesting
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.400]   where I talk about interesting things
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.520]   that people sent to the interesting
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.040]   at calnewport.com email address.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.460]   First, let me mention another sponsor
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.160]   that makes this show possible.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.580]   And that's our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.900]   You've heard me talk about Blinkist a lot
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.680]   because I think reading is the best way
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.520]   to gain high quality ideas
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.080]   and high quality ideas are the currency
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   to success in our current culture.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.980]   If you're into reading,
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:16.400]   you need to be a Blinkist subscriber.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.160]   When you subscribe to Blinkist,
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.040]   you get access to 15 minute summaries
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.960]   called Blinks of over 5,000 nonfiction books.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.800]   You also can get 15 minute summaries of podcasts.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.960]   So they call those shortcast.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.560]   This allows you to very quickly figure out
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.220]   what the big ideas are from a book
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.060]   and make that decision.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.760]   Do I know what I need to know?
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.800]   Or am I intrigued enough I wanna buy this book?
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.460]   So it is like having a sidekick for the reading life.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.320]   Jesse, you were telling me before we went on the air
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.480]   that you have a pretty particular Blinkist process, right?
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.400]   You're a long time Blinkist user.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.680]   What's your Blinkist process?
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.840]   How do you use Blinkist?
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.240]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.360]   So for instance, Ryan Holiday sent out his books email
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.480]   last week, I think.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.700]   So I went through those books and then went into Blinkist,
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.280]   put them on some of those on my save list.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.920]   And then about twice a week, I go into the app
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.000]   and read some of my save ones and then take them off saved
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.100]   and then it keeps it honed.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.420]   - Are you more a fan of the written Blinks
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.600]   or the audio Blinks?
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.440]   - The written ones.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.400]   - The written ones.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.240]   So if I didn't clarify before,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.940]   you have two options with the Blinks.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.800]   If you're on the go, you can listen to them
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.780]   or in the app, you can just read them real quick.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.200]   So I like Jesse's habit.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.600]   Every time you hear a book you're thinking about,
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.540]   throw it in the Blinkist in the app
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.800]   and then just turn through those.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.840]   What a great way to keep up with all the books,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.320]   all the big ideas and figuring out triage
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.760]   you want you wanna buy and what you don't.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.600]   So if you're gonna be a reader and you should be,
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.260]   if you're a fan of the deep life,
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.020]   you should have a Blinkist account.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.420]   They have a nice special feature
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.840]   I wanna mention real quick right now
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.280]   called Blinkist Connect that allows you
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.000]   to share your premium account.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.120]   So you can get two premium subscriptions
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.380]   for the price of one.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.120]   So you can give a Blinkist account to a friend
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.780]   that you think needs it when you sign up for one.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.040]   All right, so right now Blinkist has a special offer
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.880]   just for our audience.

[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.240]   And don't forget this limited time,
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.840]   for a limited time you can use this Blinkist Connect program
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.200]   to share your premium account.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.260]   You'll get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.480]   I also wanna talk about another one of our sponsors, Ladder.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.360]   January for me, like for other people
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.000]   is a time where you realize you're starting
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.960]   to put things off until the last minute.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.040]   For me, it's for example,
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.880]   when my accountant asks for tax information
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.280]   and I begin furiously procrastinating
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.720]   because I'm sure there's something in there,
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.640]   I don't know how to do it,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.900]   some documentation I'm missing,
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.080]   I'm sure everyone else has their own new year example
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.220]   of putting things off.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.160]   Most of the time it's okay,
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.240]   eventually get the tax information to them.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.280]   But the one thing you really can't afford to wait on
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.160]   is setting up your term life insurance.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.560]   If there is anyone who depends on you,
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.920]   spouse, kids, dependents, et cetera,
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.040]   you need life insurance,
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.380]   it should be term coverage life insurance.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.400]   You know you need it.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.880]   So why don't you have it if you don't?
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.560]   It's probably because like me worrying about
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.640]   where am I gonna find all my tax documents?
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.980]   You're not quite sure where to start.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:42.400]   So I will give you the solution to that problem, Ladder.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.500]   All right, Ladder is 100% digital,
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.900]   no doctors, no needles or no paperwork
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.160]   when you apply for $3 million in coverage or less.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.420]   You just answer a few questions
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.720]   about your health in an application.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.720]   You need just a few minutes on a phone or laptop to apply.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.480]   Then there's smart algorithms work in real time
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.240]   so you can find out if you are instantly approved.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.480]   No hidden fees, cancel any time, get a full refund
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.360]   if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.200]   These are policies that are insured by insurers
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.160]   with long proven histories of paying claims
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.920]   that are rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.320]   So this makes it easy to get life insurance.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.880]   You just go to ladderlife.com/deep,
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.780]   fill out the information.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.440]   You could get this thing off of your to-do list in minutes.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.660]   So that's ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.720]   Go there today to see if you're instantly approved.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.720]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep,
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.060]   ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.040]   All right, our final segment, something interesting.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.080]   People send me cool things from around the web
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.340]   relevant to living a deep life
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:48.240]   to my address at interesting@calnewport.com.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.380]   I like to share things when I can.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.920]   All right, today's example I wanna share
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.280]   is an article from, this is from CBS News.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.240]   So I saw this and people sent this to me from a few places.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.560]   If you are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.280]   episode 231, you'll see this on your screen,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.760]   an article where the title is
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.200]   This Tokyo Cafe Serves an Antidote to Writers Block.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.960]   So here is the idea behind this cafe in Tokyo
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   is that you don't just go in there and work,
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.480]   which you do, you pay $2.50 an hour,
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.180]   there's wifi, an air-cooled computer stand,
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.680]   but you fill out a registration slip
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.320]   where you tell the proprietors of the cafe
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320]   what you're trying to do
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.600]   and how often you want them to come check on you
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.920]   and make sure you're actually doing it.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.360]   So you don't just get a place to work,
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.000]   you get pressure to actually get that work done.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.660]   So like there's an example here, I'm reading,
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.980]   here's someone who has to write a lecture due tomorrow.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:52.160]   So on his registration slip, he asked to be checked in on,
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.520]   as they put in parentheses,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.400]   gently harassed every half hour till he's done.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.520]   I have a couple other examples in here,
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.720]   a lot of writers come in here.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.560]   So they'll say, I wanna make sure
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.760]   I get this many words written.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.680]   Here's a writer who says they wanna get 24 pages done
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.120]   and they wanna be checked on every half hour about that,
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.960]   et cetera.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.680]   Anyways, that's interesting.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.240]   You wanna get things done,
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.120]   spend your money to try to get someone to harass you
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.680]   into actually doing that work.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.440]   Now, the question is, what is my advice
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.480]   if you don't wanna go to that cafe in Tokyo?
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.520]   I would say it has to do with rituals and systems.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.260]   This is when and where I do my deep work
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.840]   and this is the rituals I do before and after
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.480]   that work is actually getting done.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.840]   That's probably the more consistent way
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.480]   to actually get really hard cognitive work done.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.880]   But what my advice shares with the strategy
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.720]   of this Tokyo cafe is a recognition
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.360]   that deep work is difficult
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.600]   and our brain will try to get out of it
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.020]   if you approach it casually.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.980]   You gotta have something else.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.240]   You gotta have structure.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.840]   It could be pain someone to bother you
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.220]   or it could be a nice schedule and a writing shed,
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.800]   but don't just think I'll get to it when I get to it.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.880]   All right, one last thing I wanna mention
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.760]   before we sign off for today.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.920]   Readers of my last book, "A World Without Email"
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.480]   know how much research I pulled
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.280]   from the UC Irvine informatics professor, Gloria Mark.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.200]   Gloria Mark is one of the, I would say the, not one of,
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.640]   the leading researcher on the impact of distractions
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.460]   in the workplace.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.440]   So as you can imagine, I'm quite familiar with her work.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.800]   Anyway, she has a new book out.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.900]   So I'm giving this an unsolicited plug here on my show.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.520]   I'm loading it up on the screen as well.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.000]   The book is called "Attention Span,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.600]   A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance,
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.360]   Happiness and Productivity."
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.160]   So I just wanna give this my thumbs up.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.000]   She really is the leading researcher
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.200]   on doing these office ethnographies
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.740]   where they go in and study people in office environments.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:50.080]   How often do they check an email?
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.960]   How often do they go back to their inbox?
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.840]   They did research with thermal cameras
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.840]   and heart rate monitors.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.420]   What happens to their stress levels
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.240]   when they see a message coming in?
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.920]   So she is the expert, so I'm glad she finally has this book.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.320]   The only thing, Jesse, if you're gonna buy this book,
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.360]   you are gonna have to look past this rube
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.480]   they got the blurb in on the cover here.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.040]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.800]   So there's a Cal Newport blurb on the cover of this book.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.680]   So that's how you know I recommend it.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.440]   So "Attention Span" by Gloria Mark,
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.960]   despite the fact that my name's on it,
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.920]   you should really give that book a try.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   All right, Jesse, I think that's all the time
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.760]   we have for today.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.800]   Thank you everyone for listening or watching.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.440]   If you wanna submit your own questions or case studies,
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.040]   see that link that's right in the show note description
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:33.920]   of this episode.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.680]   We'll be back next week.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.240]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.240]   (upbeat music)
