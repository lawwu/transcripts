[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.860]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.460]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.820]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.080]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.960]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.420]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.720]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.920]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.640]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.340]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.340]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.600]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.760]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   Well, listeners, I'm super glad to be with you as always.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.200]   And I want to share some information with you today
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.160]   about one of our resources that's been out
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.280]   for a little more than a year
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.900]   that there are a lot of misconceptions about.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.240]   And I have one of my best friends
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   who was instrumental in putting scribblers
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.120]   at home together with me.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.640]   Amy Jones is with us,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.580]   and we're going to talk to you about some of the things
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.540]   that we think might be misunderstood
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.200]   about scribblers at home,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.960]   and hopefully give you a couple more reasons
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280]   to be curious and fall in love with it.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.240]   Amy, thank you for coming.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.560]   - Oh, thank you, Lisa.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.680]   This is so fun.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.760]   And I love talking about Scribblers Resource.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.320]   It's just one of my favorite things
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.360]   that we have put together.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   It's a surprise. - I know!
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.400]   - I know, I love it too.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.660]   And I fell more and more in love with it
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.160]   the longer we worked on it.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.720]   It just, it grew in richness to me,
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.720]   and I was able to see
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.440]   how much I really believed it would touch the lives
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.140]   of all kinds of families,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.240]   not just families with little children,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.900]   you know, four to eight year olds.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.000]   And so, but one of the reasons, listen,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840]   one of the reasons I wanted to do this podcast now
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.000]   was to get the good word out,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.840]   but I also wanted to do it now
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.820]   because congratulations are in order
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.200]   for you and for the other writers.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Scribblers at Home, Recipes from Lifelong Learners,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.960]   just won an award, okay?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   We won the Illumination Book Awards Gold Award
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.460]   for Children's Education.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.800]   Were you excited about that when you heard?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.820]   - I was so excited.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.260]   I was, first of all, surprised.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.900]   One of my children said, "Mimi, you're famous,"
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.040]   which is hilarious. - Yes!
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.540]   - The first question was, "Are you a princess?"
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.580]   No, you're too old to be a princess.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.540]   You must just be famous, which was hilarious.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.380]   - That is so fun.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.340]   - You know what I loved about it
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.900]   is it's the idea for children's education.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.820]   And I thought it's the whole range.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.700]   And that's what I really loved about the award.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.020]   You know, I was surprised, but I wasn't shocked.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.100]   I was thinking it is an excellent product.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.880]   And I think it's just one of those hidden gems
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.900]   that you get your hands on it.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900]   You're like, "Wow, there's so much into these pages."
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.220]   And it's so relevant.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.220]   I think I just am amazed at how usable it is for anybody.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.900]   So I was really excited about it.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.820]   And I was excited for everyone on the team.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.140]   I thought, "Wow, this is cool."
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.700]   - I was excited too.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   I had forgotten that they were gonna put it out there.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.840]   And somebody just said,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.160]   "Hey, congratulations on your award."
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.520]   And I thought, "On my what now?"
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.020]   And so it's so funny.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.580]   You feel kind of bashful about telling people.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.100]   And so when I passed it on to my husband,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.140]   he was like, "What, this is amazing."
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.700]   Kind of like your grandchild.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.020]   "Oh, now you're famous."
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.460]   I'm like, "No, I'm not."
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.460]   I mean, this is a very localized fame here.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.820]   But like you, I was very gratified
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.820]   to see that others recognized how special it was.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.740]   You know, when we were beginning to write
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.020]   and put the resource together,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.580]   we looked and there really is not anything else
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.220]   like it out there.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.140]   And so it was real exciting to me
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.940]   to have an independent board recognize
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.780]   that Scribblers was something out of the ordinary.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.060]   So that was really cool.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.100]   And I do wanna pick your brain about Scribblers
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.940]   and get some of the things that you've been hearing
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.780]   and things that are like burning on your mind
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.060]   to share with other people.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.940]   But first I have a different question, okay?
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.620]   You're used to having all kinds of questions.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.020]   So here's my question for you.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.060]   Are you, Amy, a good cook?
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   - Oh my, I've gotten better.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.220]   - Okay.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.420]   - I would say if I trace it back to when I was first married,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.580]   I married at 28.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.940]   So I had lots of roommates before wet.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.340]   And you know, typical post-college,
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.860]   you just eat like windy salads.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.700]   - Right.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.020]   - So I didn't really have the need to cook
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.580]   until I married my very hardworking husband.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.140]   And what was funny was my mom would call me
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.460]   like checking in, you know, newly married.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.420]   Like, "What are you fixing for dinner tonight?"
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.220]   And I said, "Oh, chicken and rice."
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.860]   And evidently I must have said that for-
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.980]   - A lot.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.820]   - Yeah.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.100]   So in the mail, I got a recipe book
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.740]   that's "365 Ways to Cook Chicken."
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.100]   And so, along with the "Better Homes and Garden."
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.260]   - Yes, I bet we have the same edition.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.180]   - Standard edition.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.540]   And my mom just gently, in her quiet way,
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.780]   suggested that perhaps wet would like something
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.940]   more than chicken and rice.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.060]   He was very grateful.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.900]   It was very grateful.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.700]   He said he would never say he liked something
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.020]   because he knew I was gonna just cook it.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.260]   - Just cook it over and over and over.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.660]   That is so funny.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.580]   - I had to learn to cook.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.780]   I did not, yeah.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.580]   - Yeah, so you learned, you did learn,
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.220]   and you learned from cookbooks.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.940]   So you did use recipes in cookbooks
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.740]   when you were learning to cook.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.260]   - Oh, oh, absolutely.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.060]   I just felt like what I loved about a cookbook
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.180]   is they had already tried these recipes.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.740]   - Yes, yes.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   - They were good enough to publish them in a book.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.620]   And also what I loved about it,
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.060]   especially those standard cookbooks,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.380]   they gave you tips and techniques
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.900]   that were not intuitive.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.620]   And so you would just try,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.100]   like, oh, you put parchment paper there.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.620]   It keeps, it's like having your mom
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.060]   in your kitchen all the time.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.420]   I could just read it and go,
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.060]   oh, that's a simple thing to do.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.140]   - That'll make a huge difference.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.700]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.540]   And even like measurements and how,
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.900]   if you don't have mayonnaise,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.580]   what can you substitute it for?
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.980]   - I love those little columns, yes.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.020]   If you don't have buttermilk, did you know that?
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.740]   You can just add lemon juice to regular milk
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.820]   and let it sit there for five or 10 minutes
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.300]   and voila, it will act like buttermilk.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.140]   - Yes.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.420]   - Yes, all of that stuff.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.460]   I think we might've learned to cook the same way.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.100]   My mom was a good cook
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.820]   and I loved eating her cooking.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.220]   And I guess I had watched her through the years.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.380]   So it wasn't like I was an absolute ignoramus
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.820]   in the kitchen, but I tended to be like you
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.620]   and make the same several things over and over.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.100]   And they did not require a lot of imagination.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.980]   And I didn't know a lot about different seasonings
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.540]   or even like you were saying, different techniques.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.460]   You know, I didn't really know the difference
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.300]   between stir and fold.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.140]   - Yes.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.180]   - And all of those delicate maneuvers in the kitchen
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.020]   when I got married.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.380]   And so I, like you, loved those basics cookbooks
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.660]   that would say, you know, okay,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.620]   this is how you do a pot roast.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.820]   You know, searing the outside
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.300]   before you put something in a roasting pan.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.940]   That's not intuitive for heaven's sake.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.620]   If you're gonna roast it, why would you sear it?
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.300]   And so I love what you just said.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.340]   Things that are not necessarily intuitive
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.540]   are really helpful to have written down
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.660]   for us who want to learn to do better than we're doing.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.860]   So let me ask you this.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.060]   Do you still use, do you still have your cookbooks,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.900]   your recipes?
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.500]   - Oh yes, oh yes, I do.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.580]   I do depend on online things, which is lovely,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.300]   but I like, I have those old cookbooks
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.180]   that I have used those recipes multiple times.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.860]   I know this is a banana nut bread recipe that does work
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.900]   and has the right amount, and I like the ingredients,
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.580]   and I like how it looks at the end.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.940]   And so I always have those marked,
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.660]   and I know which cookbook it is.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.780]   I know, and I put notes in the side,
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   like I doubled this, it didn't work,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.260]   or add more ginger or whatever,
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.340]   because that's the lovely thing about a cookbook.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.220]   It becomes your own in a sense
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.300]   that you can integrate your own ideas.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.260]   Like it tastes better if you put this on top,
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.100]   or we did this for a birthday party, lots of fun.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.940]   So just becoming those notes,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.940]   it becomes your own personal kind of diary of food.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.700]   And I think because my mom had her mother's cookbook
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.820]   and she did the same thing.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.740]   So you have all these little notes and nuggets
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.460]   or old recipes stuck in the, you know, at the,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.140]   you know, on this page.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.820]   Meringue cookies, you know, you just sort of know that.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.500]   And yes, I still have cookbooks that I use
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.820]   that I refer to.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.380]   - I still look at, I mean, I know how to cook now.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.180]   I've been married for a whole lot of years,
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.180]   but I still will pull those out.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.860]   And sometimes it's because, like you said,
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.660]   I have the notes in the margin.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.860]   Like there's some recipes that it is never enough
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.700]   to make one.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.900]   So I have the, I have the, in the margin,
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.540]   I have all the measurements for a double batch, you know.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.540]   Or I have, the first time I ever made a red velvet cake,
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.820]   my mom had given me the recipe.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.380]   And when I got done, I thought, well, the icing looks weird.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.220]   I don't know, this does not look like mama's icing.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.060]   And so I called her and I said,
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.180]   I just feel like I did something wrong
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.300]   because it's kind of tan.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.820]   And she said, tan, why would it be tan?
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.860]   And I'm like, I don't know, that's why I'm calling you.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.780]   And so she made me read the ingredients
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.700]   and written on, by her hand on that recipe,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.180]   I promise you, it had a little bit of cocoa powder
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.940]   in the icing.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.060]   And she said, well, that's why it's tan.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.900]   And I said, but that's the recipe you gave me.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.860]   And she said to me, oh, I never, I always leave that out.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.060]   I was like, it was not left out of your recipe.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.420]   And so now, sometimes I look at those old recipes
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.620]   just to make me laugh or to bring back a sweet memory.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.700]   So I've kept my cookbooks because like you said,
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.580]   they have sweet memories and sweet notes.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.700]   And sometimes I pull one out
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.540]   that I haven't done in a long, long time.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.300]   And I need a refresher.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.060]   I don't remember how long this is supposed to bake
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.500]   and I really don't want it to come out like a brick.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.620]   So I look again.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.940]   And so we keep our cookbooks, we use our cookbooks.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.700]   Maybe we don't rely on them for the same things
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.300]   that we did originally, but we still love them.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.220]   - Also, Lisa, you grow in your cooking
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.140]   because I know when I got that Betty Crocker cookbook,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.620]   there were recipes I'd look at and go,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.060]   no way, Jose, am I gonna ever-
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.900]   - Absolutely.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.420]   It's like, nope, it has too many ingredients
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.660]   or too many hard steps.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.700]   - But then over a while I'll go, oh, you know what?
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.540]   That's just an extra step.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.460]   Why was I so- - Right.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.980]   - So you kind of grow sometimes into it.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.180]   - Yes, yes.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.820]   And sometimes you can say, oh, well that part,
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.100]   gosh, I guess that used to seem really hard to me,
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.380]   but that's not really hard.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.700]   That's not, doesn't take long.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.900]   It's not hard to do.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.060]   It's almost so much of a habit
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.940]   that I don't have to think about it.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.220]   So I can afford to look at a harder recipe now.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.740]   You know, that's really true.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.020]   Here's the thing, y'all.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.380]   Most of us needed a recipe or a cookbook
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.660]   in the worst way as beginners.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.860]   We did not know what we were doing.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.460]   We needed somebody or something to tell us what
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.860]   and how much and how long and in what order.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.740]   And like you said, what is it supposed to look like?
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.620]   As we learn to cook, we mostly,
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.820]   sometimes I use my cookbooks for inspiration.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.500]   I know there are recipes in there
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.180]   that never fit my occasions, but maybe they would now.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.260]   So we use recipes and cookbooks for inspiration
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.100]   or as like you said, reminders that we can take things
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.240]   to the next level now.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.660]   So listeners, why are we doing all this cooking talking?
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.540]   Because Scribblers is just like that.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.660]   In the beginning of your homeschool journey,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.580]   you really might wish that somebody would tell you what
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.980]   and how much and how long and in what order
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.540]   and what is this thing supposed to look like,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.300]   but you're gonna grow and you're gonna be willing
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   to do things that are more complicated or more abstract
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:09.740]   or require more of your imagination or your family's input.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.220]   So Scribblers can grow with you on your homeschooling
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.220]   journey, just like most of our cookbooks grew with us.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.120]   And the cool thing about Scribblers,
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.160]   if you don't already know, is that it is set up
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   like a cookbook with sections and serving suggestions
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.180]   and prep time and ingredients and the steps and the yield
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.740]   and even those tips and hints that Amy was talking about
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.420]   in her favorite cookbooks.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.500]   So we would love for you guys who haven't seen a copy
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.460]   of Scribblers before to take a look at it,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.220]   maybe at Practicum this summer.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.900]   You can even look at it online and you may be in community
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.620]   with somebody that would let you borrow theirs
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.220]   and take a look.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.980]   So let's talk a little bit about Scribblers specifically.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.980]   Amy, what did you love about working on Scribblers?
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.940]   - You know, Lisa, I was brand new to the company,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.580]   so I had no prior experience on that end of the world.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.580]   And I was so moved.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.180]   I was gonna say impressed, but that's not really the word,
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.060]   that here was a group of women.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.940]   I think there was Lee, you, Jennifer Courtney,
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.900]   I think Heather was there, and Jen Greenholt.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.940]   There was this whole group of women
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.980]   that you all had been praying over this,
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.980]   thinking over this for, I think, several years.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.900]   And I remember Lee sharing that she had sat
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.020]   with a group of young women asking them,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.380]   "What would you like?
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.820]   What's your heart's cry?
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.220]   What do you need?"
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.580]   And I thought that was so humble of just us,
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.460]   and said, "Just, we're gonna hand you something
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.500]   that we think you need."
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.580]   But really, really seeing that the heart
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.540]   of this whole enterprise, and it's for everything,
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.420]   but this particular resource, just the amount of care
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.020]   that went into thinking carefully through
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.020]   how will this benefit mom, dad.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.100]   And it's not just for, I remember Lee saying,
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.940]   "This is not just for preschoolers.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.660]   This is for challenge for moms."
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.660]   And I remember having to get my mind wrapped around that,
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.660]   but seeing that vision of equipping people
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.220]   to follow the Lord's calling on their life
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.300]   to homeschool their children.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.460]   And so, to be a part of that vision was just remarkable.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.660]   And it was, people are creative, they're fun,
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.860]   they're hardworking.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.860]   I mean, just the ideas flowing.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.900]   It was just wonderful to be sort of listening in on,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.740]   and watching the process of this,
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.340]   and just the care that went into the vision for this.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.060]   It was pretty remarkable experience for me.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.460]   So, I was very humbled.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.900]   - It was fun.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.820]   It was really fun to get together and to brainstorm,
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.020]   and I loved playing off of one another.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   But I'm so glad that you brought up Lee's beginning,
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.420]   because it was always her heart to meet,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.260]   not what we perceived the needs of families to be,
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.980]   but the needs that families had expressed.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.780]   We had rubbed shoulders, many of us at practicums
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.620]   for a lot of years,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.620]   had rubbed shoulders with young homeschool moms and dads,
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.260]   people who had older kids,
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260]   but maybe were just bringing them home
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.620]   to a home-centered education.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.860]   We had rubbed shoulders with a lot of people who said,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.860]   "But how do I get started, and what does this look like?"
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.380]   And then, "Where are we going with this?"
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.260]   Okay, I hear and I believe,
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.420]   I had lots of dads come up to me at practicums and say,
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.260]   "My wife is totally in love with this curriculum,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.660]   and my foundation's kids are doing it gangbusters,
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.460]   and they're happy, and my wife is happy,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.100]   and I can tell they're learning stuff.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.340]   But can you tell me where is this headed?
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.220]   Where is this headed?"
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.340]   They were looking at junior high and high school
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.420]   and thinking, "Is this, I mean, are we going where
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.300]   I think I want us to go?"
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.020]   And some of them weren't really sure.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.260]   They weren't able to articulate where they wanted to go,
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.820]   but they wanted to know that we had a plan.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:59.420]   And so there was that need of giving parents
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.980]   the whole roadmap.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.740]   Here's how you get started.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.820]   Here's what it looks like as you're traveling along the way,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.300]   but here's where you're going.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.740]   And I think that we didn't recognize maybe
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.260]   how ambitious a project it was when we started,
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.620]   which probably helped us to start
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.980]   with a lot more excitement than fear,
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.340]   and that's a good thing.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:29.660]   So I was really proud of what it became.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:37.100]   I was proud of having this resource
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   that answered, well, it helped families
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:51.540]   ask the questions that maybe they should have asked
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.260]   as they started homeschooling.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.900]   I was really proud of producing a resource
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   that helped families intentionally begin their journey
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.780]   in a way that I, looking back, wished I had begun my own.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.780]   And I think that's what, 'cause in a minute,
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.140]   I'm gonna ask you, "What are you the proudest of?"
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.500]   I think what I'm the proudest of is being part
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   of providing a resource that positions families
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.100]   to begin learning together with enthusiasm
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.820]   from the beginning, knowing where they're going
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.940]   and how they want to get there.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.980]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.340]   You must have read my mind.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.660]   That was exactly what I was thinking,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.220]   that the way this resource is arranged
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:53.220]   is that first part of just reflecting on what's the purpose?
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.260]   What are we striving for?
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.060]   Before we jump in to the deep end,
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.820]   what does God have for our family?
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.220]   How do we identify the needs we have,
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.740]   the type of family, the situation we're in?
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.180]   And I think that word position,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.460]   it positions you in a way that's restful,
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.540]   that focuses on the Lord.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.460]   He's leading us, so He's gonna equip us.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.060]   And then it shares with you, here are all,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.700]   it's like a cookbook.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.060]   Here are all the tools that are available for you.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.900]   You can use this, and here's another thing,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.420]   and here's another thing.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.540]   And it gives you the language you need
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.660]   to articulate what you are attempting to do.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.460]   I think that's the hardest thing is when you're asked
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.460]   by someone that's like, "Why are you doing this crazy thing?"
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.300]   That sometimes you just don't have the language,
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.620]   like you know in your heart,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.820]   this is the right thing for our family,
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.500]   but I don't know how to articulate what we're about.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.380]   And I think part, especially that first part of this book,
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.300]   it gives you all the language.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.820]   It gives you, here's the way,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.700]   it's giving you time to pause and think about,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.100]   here's the vision of what we want,
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.340]   and here are the tools that we can use to accomplish that.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.020]   And it reminds me again that God is leading us
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.940]   and can rest in that.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.380]   And I just love that.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.340]   I think that's one of my favorite parts of the book
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.860]   is that first introductory part
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.180]   where you are really inviting people
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.140]   to define their own school.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.780]   And they're lovely, it's really lovely.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.620]   - I love that.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.980]   I went back as I was preparing to interview you, Amy,
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.500]   I went back and read that part again.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.260]   And what you say is really true.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.340]   It just, it gave me a warm feeling.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.340]   The goal for that introduction was to empower parents
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:03.500]   to intentionally choose their path and their tools,
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.820]   to articulate their vision,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   to realize that we all get to fine tune this journey
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.580]   for our family.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.300]   Like everybody's homeschool
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.740]   is gonna look a little bit different
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.860]   'cause everybody's family is a little bit different.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.700]   And that's beautiful and wonderful.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.740]   And that is part of the privilege
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.940]   that the Lord is offering us.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.780]   - Yes.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.700]   And you know what I love about it too, Lisa,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.380]   I think when you, I think you were writing that part
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.780]   is that we, you know, just like cooking,
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.500]   you grow your family ages
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.620]   and almost every year or every couple of years
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.180]   to go back through that and go, okay, let's realign.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.820]   Let's remind ourselves, what was our vision?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.340]   What in the heck was I thinking?
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.060]   - Yes, right.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.660]   - That was really a bad idea.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.420]   You know, cramming 50,000 things in our year.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.780]   I really wanna back up and reassess.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.500]   And that's also how this could be used
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.180]   is to realign our vision.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.660]   Like, okay, because I get off, you know,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.340]   I start gravitating into all these other places
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.980]   instead of going, no, wait a minute.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.100]   I have four children.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.940]   What is best for our family?
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.580]   How can I honor my husband?
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.900]   How can I serve the Lord?
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.580]   How can I keep things in balance?
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.900]   And I've gotten off balance.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.100]   And I feel like that first part just helped,
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.580]   just rereading it going, that's right.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.420]   That's right.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.260]   - And it's always a good thing to remember
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.140]   'cause on a dark day you think,
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.540]   I don't know why I ever thought this was a good idea.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.060]   I don't know how I ever thought
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.460]   that I was gonna get to the end of all of this
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.580]   with my sanity and all my children alive
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.500]   and fairly well, you know,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.420]   fairly well developed and adjusted.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   But when you have thoughtfully designed a family mission,
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:08.540]   when you have really thought about
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.100]   what is it that I want my children to know?
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.420]   What is important to our family?
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.500]   How do we want to grow together as learners?
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.580]   Then you can always go back to that.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.100]   At the end of a really bad day, you can go back and say,
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.620]   oh, well, actually I didn't say
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.100]   that everybody was gonna learn to speak three languages
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.540]   by the time they graduated.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.220]   I said that we were gonna learn
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.740]   to have good conversations together and love the Lord
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.860]   and use our tools of learning to study His word
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.460]   and His world and be good.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.740]   And so I think that's really, that's awesome.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.580]   So that's what you and I love and that's what we're proud of.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.660]   What do you hear people loving about Scribblers at home
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.020]   as you're out and about, as you're helping families,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.900]   how are people using it
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.940]   and what are they doing with Scribblers?
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.780]   - I think that people are just discovering things.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.460]   Like they probably picked it up at practicum last year.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.820]   And what I hear is as they are about to launch
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.620]   their Challenge A student or their Challenge One student,
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.980]   those big launching years,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.980]   they are like, I cannot believe what these charts,
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:30.660]   so excited to have these all in one place.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.620]   So I know what team policy debate looks like.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.420]   I know what a first conjugation, at least I have a chart.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.060]   You know, I may not understand it, but I can look at it.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.260]   I can review it and I can pull it out for my student
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.380]   and we can sit down and look at it.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.380]   I know how to play a math game.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.580]   I mean, there are so many things, especially,
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.420]   and that was the vision that Lee had
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   was really equipping parents to really get to
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.540]   for the whole years of schooling, of homeschooling,
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.100]   whatever that is.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.620]   And it's so rich in resources.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.220]   I think that's the biggest surprise that I've heard.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.740]   And they're like, if I had only had this last year.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.180]   And that's what I hear.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   I also hear from younger moms, I gave these as gifts.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.740]   I bought some and gave them to my daughters
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.060]   and daughters-in-law and they,
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.700]   and Mary Claire called me and said,
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.700]   "Mom, that whole section on the parts of a story,
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.420]   "that is so clear."
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.860]   And so she was like, "We're really using that."
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.940]   Now, her oldest is nine.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.740]   So it's for that younger, she goes,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.580]   "I didn't have it all in my mind."
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.620]   She said, "This is what I would typically do.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.700]   "Go online and spend 25 minutes looking
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   "for a chart of what the parts of a story,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.780]   "the climax of the story and what's the plot with it."
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.380]   And she said, "It's right here.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.460]   "I didn't know it had so many resources like that."
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.540]   So that's what I've also heard,
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.660]   is that people, it's like at your fingertips
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.340]   when you're just right there,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.900]   I'm in the middle of something,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.300]   I don't have time to go look.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.660]   I can just go, "Oh, let's learn some Roman numerals."
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.420]   Right there.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.420]   And so I think that those are the two things
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.300]   just surprises older moms going, "You need to have this."
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.460]   - I've heard people say, "Oh my gosh.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.580]   "Why did they not tell you that this is what you need
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.540]   "to understand the whole program from beginning to end?"
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.580]   I have actually heard people,
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.100]   sometimes I'm not really lurking,
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.420]   but I'm in a crowd and people don't know
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.580]   that I had anything to do with it.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.700]   So I just hear them talking about it at a practicum
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.060]   or at a book sale or something like that.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.340]   And I hear people, I've heard people say,
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.580]   "This, this is what you really need.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.820]   "This is how it starts, but it shows you where it's going
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.460]   "and it shows you where every strand is going."
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.860]   And one of the things that I really, really like
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.700]   that I think is helpful that I also think gets overlooked.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.860]   And so listeners, what Amy and I are also telling you
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.380]   is all the pieces of this resource that we love
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.220]   that some people have not found yet.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.220]   One of the things that I love is the two-page spread
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.340]   that each strand has before the recipes,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.900]   before the activities.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.140]   So it's called "Everyone Has a Grammar Of."
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.460]   So like there's a grammar of science.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.980]   There's a two-page spread and it tells you,
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   it answers all those questions that your mother-in-law
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.740]   or maybe your dad, maybe your husband is saying,
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.220]   "Why are you studying this?"
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.100]   'Cause like for Latin, why are you studying Latin
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.540]   with these little four to eight-year-olds, okay?
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.140]   Why are you studying science?
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.420]   What kind of science do you want to study?
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.560]   How can you and your children together at home
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.740]   become scientists?
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.460]   What are the skills of a scientist?
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.580]   We don't want you at home just to learn about science.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.740]   We want you to become scientists.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.500]   So what tools and thinking patterns do scientists use?
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.460]   What questions do they pose?
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:55.460]   And then how can you become a lifelong science learner?
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.220]   We give a lot of lip service to becoming lifelong learners,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.060]   but how do you do that?
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.140]   I mean, what will start us on that path?
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.620]   And then I love it 'cause there are tools over here.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.660]   So if you want to become, if you want to study science
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.660]   and you're a scribbler, what do you do?
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.900]   Well, it tells you right here,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.980]   go out and get a magnifying glass.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.540]   You can get them at the dollar store, okay?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   You want one big enough for little hands to use, okay?
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.720]   A magnifying glass and tweezers and safety scissors
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.060]   and a flashlight and a funnel.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.860]   Now see, I might not have thought of that
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.980]   before I had kids, that a funnel might be a scientist tool.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.260]   A bug net and a bug container, a notebook,
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.700]   some plastic bags, a dip net and a bucket
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.980]   and a picture encyclopedia of the natural world.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.720]   So what an easy thing.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.740]   So what if you, what if your mom or dad says to you,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.260]   "Well, what should I get the kids for Christmas?"
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.900]   And you don't want them to have another video game
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.420]   and you don't want another toy to strow
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   around your playroom floor, look on these tools pages.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.700]   Maybe they'll get your kids some eyedroppers
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.780]   and some beakers if they are a little bit older.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   So I love those pages that got really concrete
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.860]   it doesn't just say, we're gonna study,
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.820]   we're gonna do this science activity.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.940]   So this is what comes behind it.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.940]   And I liked that.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.940]   - Oh, I think it's wonderful because it gives me as it,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:36.140]   it provides me as a mom, as a kind of a way of thinking
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:42.880]   about how to introduce these strands to my children
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.860]   in a way that I take ownership.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.340]   I can educate myself.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.780]   That's what I was telling someone.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.340]   This book is sort of like a foundations curriculum
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.820]   that if I had had, this is like,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.620]   not only just the on-ramp to homeschooling
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.740]   because if you had this,
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.900]   you would be very, very well prepared.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.280]   But also it's the ongoing ramp that you,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.180]   like you just said, I would have never thought of that.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.500]   And someone thought of it for you
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.580]   is that you thought, oh, I see.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.140]   And it equips you to take the next step.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.420]   You don't have to reinvent your homeschool environment
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.920]   from scratch.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.820]   This is a guide that helps you think
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.420]   like it just gives you a way of thinking
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.040]   and approaching something.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.900]   Why, what, how, that's super simple.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.100]   But I skip that.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.900]   I just go to, well, what do I need at Amazon or something?
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.200]   Instead of, no, let me think.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.180]   Even as you're evaluating curriculum,
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.840]   why, what, how, those are really good questions.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.620]   And so, and also I love the fact
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.180]   that they use the classical tools.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.940]   We incorporated those.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.780]   So they're not just some foreign word.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.140]   It's like, oh, I need to compare.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.740]   Oh, that's a great, that's simple.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.740]   But I don't have a form,
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.980]   and I think it establishes your own habit
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.340]   of how you educate.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.300]   It's really lovely in that way.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.140]   Yes, yes.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:23.980]   - Oh, I love it.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.580]   And I do love,
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.780]   I don't want to say that I don't love the activities
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.220]   'cause I still do.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.860]   I love being able to do what you said,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.740]   just pick and choose,
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.380]   just let the book fall open
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.280]   and decide what are we gonna do.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.820]   So I just let the book fall open now.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.900]   And there was a history.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.460]   It's a history activity called Fill the Shelves.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.780]   And you can play, it's a game you can play in the car.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.620]   - Ah.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.420]   - So there are all kinds of activities,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.200]   things that you do in the backyard,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.180]   things that you do in the car,
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   things that require no equipment or supplies at all.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.460]   And some that require things
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.820]   that you're gonna have at home,
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.020]   crayons, scrap paper, a clothes hanger,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.780]   stuff like that.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.340]   Things that are easily accessible to most of us
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.660]   that we might not think of the activity
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.100]   when we've had a really long, hard day on our own,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.760]   but we could easily follow somebody else's idea
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.040]   for the activity.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.820]   And so I just really love that.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.380]   - I do too.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.660]   I think, I'm sorry.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.520]   I think that some people just see it
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.980]   as maybe it's just an activity booklet.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.300]   And I thought, oh no, you can do that on Pinterest.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.180]   I mean, that's just easy.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.720]   But what I do love about it is,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.580]   for example, I think in the math portion
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.740]   that there's this, there's an activity,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.340]   but then you look right over and you go,
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.620]   oh, wait a minute, that connects with this.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.500]   And so, especially as, if you are a mom like I was,
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.100]   and when they said, oh, we're gonna do Latin,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.780]   I just thought, no.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.380]   (both laughing)
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.300]   - No, no we're not.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:18.140]   - But what I love about this is so restfully arranged.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.500]   And so it's not just those activities are great
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.940]   for your children, but they're inviting for adults like,
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.500]   oh, well, wait a minute, we can play that little game
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.860]   and I can look like I know what I'm doing.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.700]   - Right, until I do, we can fake it till we make it, right?
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.940]   - Exactly, and then you start seeing like,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.860]   well, that's not so hard.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.580]   And I think I just love how they put
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.940]   just the design of the book.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.060]   It just is very, it's very inviting.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.820]   - It is very inviting.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.820]   - Technical book is very.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   - Yep, it's very colorful, it's very easy to use.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.820]   It's easy to flip open the spiral binding,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.180]   makes it really easy to find your spot
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.580]   and just carry it around.
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   - Well, there are people who, I always hear people say,
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.900]   oh, well, I didn't think Scribblers was for me.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.420]   So here's the thing, here's the deal.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.180]   Every family should give Scribblers another look.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.900]   Families who are just starting out who think,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.020]   I'd really like to do this well from the beginning.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.340]   What are some of the things I should think about?
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.020]   What should my husband and I sit down and consider
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.380]   before we jump into this journey?
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.260]   Or we've been doing this for a couple of years
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.860]   and it feels a little chaotic.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.620]   And I would like to think that we are more unified
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.740]   in the why.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.300]   So Scribblers is perfect.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.740]   That whole first introductory section
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.540]   helps you build your why as a family.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.660]   There are so many, like you said, Amy,
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.620]   challenge parents who pick this up and say,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.980]   whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.620]   This is supposed to be an activity book for little kids,
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.220]   but I want all these charts, all of these charts,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.580]   the topic wheel chart and a microscope chart,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.860]   a polygons chart, like Mary Claire said,
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   the parts of a story chart, an invention chart.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.900]   How many of us had our child come home from challenge
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.260]   and say, well, this week is invention.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.500]   I need to think about how to write my paper.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.540]   And we're like, invention, now what would that be?
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.140]   So here on page 109, families, is an invention chart.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   It tells you exactly the guiding questions for inventing.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.100]   So lots of challenge parents would be blessed
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.620]   by this resource because it shows you where you're going
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.500]   with all this fun that you can do.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.660]   But I'll also tell you, lots of challenge students
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.900]   enjoy Scribblers activities.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.580]   Another group of people that I think
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.060]   would really love Scribblers,
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.940]   if they had half a chance, is grandparents.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   Scribblers makes it really easy for you to let grandma
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.060]   or grandpa be part of your homeschooling
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.060]   because the activities are so easy to do on the fly.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.940]   You don't have to have a lot of context.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.660]   They don't have to know what your children
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.660]   have been memorizing for the last eight weeks
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.980]   in order to do a Scribblers activity
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   that will really build a skill through intentional play.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.740]   And it makes your kids excited
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.060]   to have grandma and grandpa play with them.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.020]   It makes grandma and grandpa excited
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.180]   to feel like they are part of your homeschool mission
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.060]   and they know what to do and how to do it.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.220]   So that's another group that I think
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:05.060]   might be missing what Scribblers has to offer.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.460]   What about you?
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.340]   Who do you think might love Scribblers
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.060]   if they gave it another look?
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.580]   - You know, I think I was just thinking for myself
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.820]   that through all the stages of,
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.660]   especially I would say after we made that initial decision
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.620]   and probably three years in,
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.300]   and that's when you're sort of hit with the reality
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   that by that time we had two, soon to be three children
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.380]   in our homeschool family.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.220]   And it just felt like I was a frantic
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:47.060]   and I didn't know, why am I doing this?
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.180]   Am I capable of doing this?
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.180]   And I think that, I think it's one of those resources
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.380]   that you need to keep on your shelf like a cookbook.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.580]   You pull it off your shelf and you say,
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.460]   okay, what do I need?
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.900]   Where do I feel like I'm lacking?
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.260]   And I think one thing that's lovely,
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.780]   and I love this about classical conversations,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.980]   everyone is a learner.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.740]   And as a mom, you're a lead learner.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:20.020]   You are a, and you are a fantastic learner.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.780]   And there are some things in here you might go,
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.260]   oh, I was an English major.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.700]   Got it, got the literature part.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.620]   But I am so intimidated by science or history.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.380]   I wasn't really into that.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.980]   I'm gonna just, and really, I'm not kidding you.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.020]   If you, I told me, I was telling my daughters,
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.340]   if you just open the book and look at,
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.300]   oh, Latin prepositions and adverbs chart.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.340]   I'm just, and I think, oh, it might make you feel
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.860]   a little nauseous, like what?
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.460]   I don't know what that is about.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.420]   But then I looked, there's a little clock
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.980]   that talks about time.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.660]   There's manner, affirmation, negation, place, and degree.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.460]   And all I can do is look at this,
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.100]   and in a matter of, I would say 10 minutes, maybe,
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.500]   look over this, and that becomes a little more familiar.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.700]   And we always learn in cycles, in layers.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.180]   And so the next time my child comes home and says,
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.940]   what's a preposition?
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.660]   I can say, well, not only can I tell you
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   what a preposition is,
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.820]   I can tell you what a Latin preposition is.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.020]   And I can help them.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.140]   It just empowers you.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.260]   I think the world just inundates us.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.420]   And it does, it's not just at the beginning.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:40.420]   It's every year you are fighting for the truth
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.140]   that God has placed me as the educator of my children.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.980]   And every year, I would say, even throughout the year,
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.460]   I was always going back to that truth.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.780]   No, this is our calling.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.620]   It's what God has called us to.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.260]   And yet we don't have a fancy lab,
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.100]   and I don't know all this or that.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.220]   And the world just kind of screams at you
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.740]   that this needs to be a professional
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.220]   doing what you're doing.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.980]   And this, I think, what I love the most about this,
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.260]   the Scribblers, is that it's a resource
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.700]   that I feel equipped.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.540]   Like I have at least the words, the language,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.380]   the basic understanding, and I can go from here.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.820]   I can get deeper,
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.380]   but I've already got the groundwork is laid for me.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.540]   So when my challenged one child comes home and says,
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.780]   we're doing team policy,
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.860]   I don't have to go online and look up
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.140]   someone else's version of what a team policy debate is.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.820]   I can go right here and know this is,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.020]   and of course, the beauty of this
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:50.220]   is it's directly tied to the challenge curriculum.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.460]   So it's not gonna be some odd definition that-
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.580]   - Right.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.340]   - It's gonna be directly
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.140]   what your child is learning in community.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.260]   So I love that.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.980]   That's just wonderful.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.780]   - It's gonna help parents get started well
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.900]   and continue alongside their child
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.660]   on that educational journey.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.900]   And really, that's the whole point of Scribblers
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.460]   is to create a family culture of learning,
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.740]   the rhythms of learning together for life.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.500]   Amy, thank you for helping me celebrate Scribblers
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   and maybe giving people another reason to take another look.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.700]   - Yes.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.180]   - Families, I also want you to know that
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.700]   the Scribblers writers will be receiving
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.540]   their Illuminations Gold Reward at National Conference.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.180]   So let me tell you,
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.460]   if you want to meet the writers of Scribblers,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.300]   that's only a small reason to go to National Conference.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.940]   You need to mark your calendar for May 2nd
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.500]   through the 4th in Southern Pines.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.300]   There's gonna be a lot of things going on there.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.740]   You're gonna be able to hear talks
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.780]   from homeschool leaders like Lee Bortons.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.380]   You could be part of National Commencement.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.980]   You could watch our official graduation ceremony
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   for Challenge graduates and their parents.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.300]   You could see some of the National Memory Master Championship
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.180]   with the grand prize of $10,000.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.780]   If you haven't been,
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.780]   if you're a CC family who hasn't been
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.580]   to National Events Weekend yet,
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.780]   this might be your year to go.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.780]   If you're interested and you want to find out more,
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:37.780]   you can go to classicalconversationsfoundation.org.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:42.620]   Amy and I hope that we'll see you there.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.940]   Amy, I can't wait to see you there.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.700]   And I'm looking forward to touch a base with you.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.500]   And I want to say thank you again
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.940]   for sharing your heart for Scribblers with our listeners.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.300]   - This was just a delight.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.140]   Thank you.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.980]   - This was fun.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.340]   Okay, I will see you soon, Amy.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.820]   Listeners, I hope I'll see you soon too.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.660]   Bye-bye.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.660]   (gentle music)
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.240]   (gentle music)
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
