[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.620]  ечение
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.940]   en to, It,
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.000]   most
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   and,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120]  howern,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:25.620]   it's not a person, my apologies, let's press on, because today I want to talk to you about the importance of setting goals that you don't know how to achieve. And I want to give you permission to set goals that you don't know how to achieve. Thus far in this goal setting series, I've tried to speak very practically. I've tried to talk about things in a very tactical and tangible way, strategically.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.620]   Strategically, I've not engaged in any sort of a conversation about goals that I don't know how to achieve. And I want to give you permission to set goals that you don't know how to achieve. Thus far in this goal setting series, I've tried to speak very practically. I've tried to talk about things in a very tactical and tangible way, strategically.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:54.160]  and you can believe it, and you can dream it, and you can achieve it. I haven't tried to rev you up, I've just talked to you about the process of setting goals, which is in and of itself simple. You have a place that you want to go, so you sit back and you consider how to get there, and you decide if you're going to commit to getting there all the way. If you are in Miami and you want to drive to San Diego or you want to get there, you can do that.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   and you want to drive to San Diego or you want to get there, and you decide if you're going to commit to getting there all the way. If you are in Miami and you want to drive to San Diego or you want to get there, you can do that.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.660]   and you want to drive to San Diego or you want to get there, you can do that.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:24.700]  , and you want to drive to San Diego or you want to get there, you can do that.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   You want to go to San Diego or you want to go to San Diego, you got to sit down and you say, "Well, why am I going to San Diego? How do I want to get there? Do I want to fly? Do I want to drive? How, etc. And then let's say you want to take a road trip there, you got to figure out some of the logistics of the car that you're going to drive, you got to get a map and you got to start going. And along the way you course correct and when problems occur, you fix those problems. You have a flat tire, you run out of gas, you take a wrong turn, well you fix those problems, and eventually if you don't quit, you get to San Diego. And it's that way with every single goal in life that you could possibly set.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:50.740]   You have an idea, a vision of where you want to go. You try to figure out where you are. Try to figure out a vehicle that's going to get you from where you are to where you want to go. Count the cost, see if you think it's worth doing, start working on it. Along the way problems are going to come up, you're going to be derailed by this thing, that thing, etc. You course correct, but as long as you don't quit, you will eventually arrive at your goal. You will eventually achieve your goal.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:20.780]  , so this is not woo woo stuff, this is not any kind of metaphysical thing, this is very practical. But yet, what if you want to set a goal and you don't know how to achieve it? What if you want to set a goal, but you're not quite sure what vehicle would get you to the place you want to go, should you still do it? Well my only goal and ambition in today's show is to say to you simply, "Yes." You should set a goal, even if you don't know how to get there.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.780]   You should set a goal, even if you don't know how to get there.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.780]   You should set a goal, even if you don't know how to get there.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.820]   And in fact, if you're not setting goals that you don't know how to achieve, you probably aren't setting goals big enough.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.820]   And in fact, if you're not setting goals that you don't know how to achieve, you probably aren't setting goals big enough.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.820]   You probably aren't going to challenge your own personal potential.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820]   You probably aren't going to challenge your own personal potential.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.820]   If you're only setting goals that you know how to achieve, frankly, you probably don't have a list of goals.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   You have a list of projects, a list of actions, you have a to-do list.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:45.820]   You have a list of projects, a list of actions, you have a to-do list.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820]   One component of goal, the whole concept of setting a goal, should be set in a goal.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.820]   The whole concept of setting a goal, should be set in a goal, should be set in a goal.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:20.860]   Transportation, the whole concept of setting a goal, should be setting something that excites you, even if you don't know how to achieve it. And then just simply part of achieving the goal is figuring out how am I going to achieve this. But it's fine to set goals. In fact, it's important to set goals that you don't know how to achieve. I'll give you one story from my own life that proved this to me. I remember very clearly, I was working at my first job out of college. I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.860]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.

[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.860]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:50.900]  , I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.

[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.

[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   I was working as an entry level analyst at a marketing company.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   So all I've got to do is I've got to develop myself and I've got to learn the skills to go from this entry level or kind of middleish. It wasn't just grunt work but kind of middleish marketing level to become a senior marketing consultant. That's what I've got to do. Then I'll achieve my goal of getting to $100,000 per year.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   I would sit down every day.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   I, Joshua Sheets, earned $100,000 per year by this date. It was about three years out. I would write it out every day.
