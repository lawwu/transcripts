[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.200]   In this episode, I want to talk about the Roth IRA, the tax now Roth IRA, because the
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.600]   tax cuts that were passed due to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 will expire on December
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.640]   31st, 2025.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   If Congress does nothing, which nothing is what they tend to do, taxes will revert to
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.600]   their pre-2018 levels on January 1st, 2026.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.120]   This means tax rates will go up anywhere between 1% to 5%.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.800]   And therefore, the logical conclusion and solution is to try and convert some of your
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.860]   tax deferred retirement money in your 401ks and traditional IRAs into a tax now Roth IRA.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.340]   This way, you can potentially save on taxes during your retirement years.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.920]   So I think it's important to talk about this subject now because we have slightly less
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.200]   than three years to convert our tax deferred funds to tax now funds in a Roth IRA.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.940]   And sometimes or oftentimes you don't want to convert too much because it might bring
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.120]   you to a higher tax rate.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.960]   So three years is a good amount of time to plan ahead.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.980]   The question is, how much of your tax deferred retirement funds should you move?
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.400]   And at what marginal income tax bracket should you contribute or convert to a Roth IRA to
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.440]   minimize future retirement tax liability?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.200]   Before I answer these questions, let me share my historical thoughts on the Roth IRA.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.320]   I've long been an opponent of the Roth IRA since I haven't been able to contribute since
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.680]   I turned 25 in 2002.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.640]   The arbitrary income limits to be able to contribute shut me out, so I decided to reject
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.040]   the Roth IRA as well.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.120]   So I was completely biased for over a decade.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   Right now in 2023, you can contribute to a Roth IRA, which is 6500 max.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.440]   If your income is under 153,000 as an individual single filer, or under 228,000 as a married
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   filing jointly, you can contribute the maximum 6500 if you make under $138,000 as a single
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.240]   individual and under $218,000 as a married filing jointly.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.400]   There is basically a prorated amount you can contribute less and less as you get to the
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.200]   153,000 and over for singles and 228,000 and over for married filing jointly.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.400]   Now these income levels in 2023 seem pretty reasonable, but at the same time, it's also
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.320]   rather arbitrary.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.200]   Why not double the amounts?
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.360]   Shouldn't all American taxpaying citizens get to fund and take care of their retirement
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   future?
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   I think so.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.280]   In addition, I was an opponent of doing a Roth IRA conversion.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.360]   It just wasn't appealing to me after I left my day job in 2012, my overall income declined
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.440]   by 80% as a result.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   And the last thing I wanted to do was pay more taxes when I had way less income.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.000]   Instead, I just wanted to hold on to as much cash as possible because I was facing an uncertain
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.080]   future.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.280]   Was this the right idea at 34 years old?
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200]   Didn't feel right, but I had the severance package and I had some passive income.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.400]   And I also had hope that I could grow Financial Samurai and do other things to make supplemental
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   retirement income.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.080]   However, now that I'm 45 years old and I have two young children, I now believe contributing
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.240]   to a Roth IRA is a good way to tax efficiently diversify your retirement income sources.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.400]   Roth IRA withdrawals don't face required minimum distributions.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.880]   Further Roth IRAs do not count as provisional income and therefore don't cause any of your
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.080]   social security to be taxed.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.780]   Just know that for required minimum distributions on December 29th, 2022, President Biden signed
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.040]   into law the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2023.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:24.560]   That includes the Secure Act 2.0, which basically increases RMD age to 73 in 2023 and to 75
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.320]   in 2033.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.680]   So this is good if you don't need the money because it enables you to pay less retirement
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.320]   taxes, but you've got to live that long.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.340]   But if you die before the RMD and you never spend your retirement funds, well, then it
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.360]   goes to your heirs.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.880]   But that also shows that maybe you didn't properly consumption spend throughout your
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.400]   life and you spend too much time working and investing and stressing about the money.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.080]   Those are just some things to think about as you plan for retirement.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   To decide on paying taxes upfront by contributing or converting assets into a tax now Roth
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.080]   IRA, we should make three assumptions.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   One, Congress will let taxes return to previous levels on January 1st, 2026.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.400]   Two, tax rates may go even higher than pre-2017 levels due to an even larger budget deficit.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   We've got to pay for all this pandemic spending, stimulus spending.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.900]   Three, you believe your tax rates in retirement will be higher than your tax rates while working.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.800]   This is the most important variable.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.060]   Do you believe you're going to pay more taxes when you're not working or more taxes when
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.720]   you're working?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.960]   Now I know it's human nature to think we are smarter, better looking, more charismatic,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.300]   charming than we really are.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.520]   But the reality is we probably hover around the average plus or minus one standard deviation.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   That's just what it is.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.400]   Therefore, I just don't think the vast majority of Americans will be paying a higher tax rate
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.440]   in retirement than while working because most Americans won't be making more money in retirement
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   than while working.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.700]   If you do a gut check, this makes sense.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.300]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.640]   You're working, so you're making more money.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.840]   What kind of person makes more money in retirement?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.920]   Well, maybe a really lucky person who got a huge windfall or maybe someone who invested
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.160]   amazingly well, or we just have super high inflation, high risk-free rates, high dividend
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.120]   yields, high returns in retirement, and we're just crushing it.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.600]   But is that going to be reality?
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.120]   I just don't think so.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   Just look at what the median retirement balance is in America.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.960]   It's about $100,000, right?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   And the median Social Security payment is around $22,000 to $24,000.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.340]   So even if you withdraw $10,000 a year from your median retirement balance of $100,000,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.680]   your total income, if you add on Social Security, is around $32,000 to $34,000.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.520]   And that falls within the 12% marginal federal income tax rate, which is low.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.720]   And if you're making that money, do you think the government is really going to go after
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   you?
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.480]   I don't think so.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.100]   Politicians crave power more than anything else.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.240]   So if politicians raise taxes on the middle class, they will lose the most number of votes.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.520]   And if you lose the most number of votes, you're not going to stay in power for very
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   long.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.040]   It's the same thing with Social Security.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.180]   Cost of living adjustment went up huge, 8.6% in 2023.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.400]   This was an opportunity to actually lower the COLA.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.960]   And it's been an opportunity every single year since we realized the Social Security
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.760]   pension fund is underfunded by 22 to 25%.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:56.400]   But politicians aren't willing to raise that retirement age or reduce the Social Security
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.900]   benefits during retirement, because that would mean political suicide.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.540]   They will not get reelected.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.840]   Even President Biden, who is a Democrat, who is for bigger government, has said he will
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   not raise taxes on any person or any household making less than $400,000 a year.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.640]   $400,000 a year is a top, I would say 3% income, because top 1% income is over $500,000 a year
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   now.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.400]   So he's unwilling to raise taxes on the top 3% income earners.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.760]   Maybe it's top 2%.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   So what makes you think if you make $250,000, $200,000, $150,000, $100,000, or $50,000,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.720]   you're going to pay more taxes in the future?
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.040]   I don't think you will.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.580]   Yes, we are at the historical lows of tax rates.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.580]   We are.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.520]   If you look since 1950, we haven't been lower.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:00.200]   The problem is, once you give goodies, right, once you start giving people what they want,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.760]   they are loathe to give up what they have.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.660]   And once politicians have power, they are loathe to give up that power as well.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.600]   So we are actually in cahoots with the politicians.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.000]   We want lower tax rates and the politicians want power.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.880]   So the majority is going to vote to keep tax rates probably the same.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.160]   So we need to figure out at what marginal federal income tax rate is it worth converting
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   to a Roth IRA or contributing.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   And my answer is this.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.520]   At a 24% rate, it's a wash, break even.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:47.580]   As a single individual, that means you're making between $95,376 to $182,100.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:57.400]   For married filing jointly, that means you're making between $190,751 to $364,200.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.960]   So in other words, if you start converting at a 24% marginal federal income tax rate
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   to a Roth IRA, when you retire, I think it's going to be a wash.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.240]   These income levels are the protected class.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.880]   They're protected because this is mass affluent class, including middle class for some people
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   who live in more expensive countries.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.020]   And politicians don't want to raise your taxes.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.880]   So this leaves us with the 22%, 12%, and 10% marginal federal income tax rates.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   At these rates, I think you can convert.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.980]   You'll probably end up okay.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.680]   Even if you don't end up okay, the most you'll probably pay more in taxes is maybe 1% or
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   2%.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.720]   So let's just do some quick math on the 24% marginal federal income tax profile, where
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.880]   it's a wash.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.480]   So let's say you're an individual making the bottom of the range of the 24% marginal income
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.200]   tax bracket, $95,736.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.760]   As a worker, you're paying that 24% marginal income tax rate on $1.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.040]   But to generate that same amount of income in retirement would require amassing about
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.200]   $2.4 million at a 4% rate of return.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.080]   Now remember, the median retirement balance is only $100,000.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.500]   So we're talking about you accumulating 24 times the medium.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.940]   It's possible, but again, we got to be a little bit realistic.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.880]   Even with $25,000 a year in Social Security, which is, you know, today's dollars probably
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.540]   what you would earn if you were making that kind of income for 35 years.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.040]   You'd still need about $1.9 million in retirement to generate $70,736 a year at a 4% rate of
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   return.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   I got $70,736 by subtracting $25,000 a year in Social Security by that income of $95,736.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:03.560]   $1.9 million is a lot of money for someone who's been averaging $96,000 for 35 years.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.720]   But it's doable.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.640]   I just don't think the majority of people who make that kind of money will accumulate
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.400]   that much in retirement.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.560]   Just look at the data.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:20.520]   Therefore, most retirees making that $96,000 level will likely earn less.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.220]   And if they earn less, they will likely pay a lower marginal federal income tax rate.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.240]   Maybe 12%, maybe 10%.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.020]   Because here's another thing, the standard deduction, the standard deduction is used
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.960]   whether you're 25 and making money or 70 making Social Security money.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.040]   In 2023, the standard deduction for an individual is $13,850.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.880]   And their standard deduction for married couples filing jointly is $27,700.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.040]   In 20 years, at a 3% annual increase, the single taxpayer standard deduction will rise
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.800]   to $25,000.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.240]   And the married couple standard deduction will rise to $50,000.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.800]   So in other words, you could make $25,000 a year in Social Security as an individual
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.880]   and pay zero taxes because of your standard deduction.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.720]   So my argument is that not only will you likely be making less money in retirement, you also
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.960]   have standard deduction you can take to lower your income even further, which lowers your
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.920]   retirement taxable income even further.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.880]   We've already agreed the government isn't going to crush the middle class taxpayer who's
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:38.720]   paying a 10, 12, or 24% marginal income tax rate by jacking tax rates higher.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.800]   The government is going to go for the top income earners, the top 1%, maybe the top
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.840]   0.1% for sure, right?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.120]   The deca millionaires, the centa millionaires and the billionaires.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.680]   So wouldn't that mean they should start converting more of their tax deferred funds into a rough
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   IRA?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.400]   I don't think so.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:06.320]   Okay, so look, 37% is the top marginal income tax rate for individuals making over $578,125
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.840]   in 2023.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.120]   That's a top 1% income for sure, because the threshold is about $500,000.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:20.640]   Now if I look at what tax rates were, what they were pre the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passage,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.840]   at over $500,000, the marginal income tax rate was 39.6%.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.800]   So it was 2.6% higher.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.080]   Okay, that's relatively significant.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.640]   And if you can make over, let's say $578,000 a year in retirement, well, yes, you'll be
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.800]   paying more than 2.6% in taxes.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.160]   But in order to make $578,000 a year or more in retirement, you need to have capital of
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.760]   at least $14.4 million at a 4% rate of return.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.400]   Now how many people have that?
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.920]   Well, less than 1% because the top 1% net worth figure is about $12 million right now
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.880]   in 2023.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.220]   Might be less since 2022 was a bear market.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:13.600]   So if you are a top 1% income earning person, you appreciate the lower tax rates now.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.360]   But are you really going to be enthused about paying 37% upfront to convert your tax deferred
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.080]   money to a Roth IRA?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.200]   I don't think so.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.920]   I think instead what you'll do is you'll keep hope alive that tax rates won't go up or won't
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.320]   go up as much.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:36.780]   Or what you might do is move to a lower income tax state when you retire because the optimal
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:44.680]   time to do a Roth IRA conversion is after you retire or in a lower tax bracket, but
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.080]   before claiming Social Security benefits, right?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:56.040]   So if you retire at 50, 55, 60, 61, and then you drop to the lowest marginal income tax
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.500]   bracket, yeah, start converting.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.080]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.160]   I just think that if you're making that kind of money, there are too many ways for you
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.120]   to shelter your taxable income and your assets from the government.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.620]   You can set up a graft, you can set up revocable trusts, irrevocable trusts, and so forth.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.520]   You can move to different states, you can move out of the country, you can renounce
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   your citizenship.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.760]   There's just all these different things you can do.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.880]   So to pay taxes upfront when the government is so spendy and so inefficient with our dollars
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.980]   feels like giving up a war, frankly, because we all have the responsibility to minimize
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.580]   our tax liability in the most legal way possible.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.800]   And paying that much upfront, ooh, that just seems too painful to me.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   So in conclusion, I count on politicians to keep tax rates low because I count on politicians
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.840]   to want to remain in power.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:01.340]   I assign only a 20% probability that tax rates are going up in 2026 and beyond for sub $250,000
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.340]   income earners.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:08.520]   For those households making over $400,000, perhaps the probability is over 60%.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.480]   But who knows who's going to win the presidency and who knows how the makeup of Congress will
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480]   be.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.960]   If you find yourself ever in the 10% or 12% marginal income tax bracket, I think you should
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.920]   convert as much as possible to a Roth IRA.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.100]   Definitely contribute as much as you can afford.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.380]   If you find yourself in the 0% marginal income tax bracket because your earned income is
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:37.860]   below the standard deduction amount, then definitely try to max out your Roth IRA contributions.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.820]   And in this situation, it's mostly probably because you're a student or you're just underemployed.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.000]   But it's hard, right?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.780]   Because you're not making that much money.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.820]   And then to ask to put away more money for your future.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.940]   It's a little tough.
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:55.720]   But that's where we parents who understand the Roth IRA and care about taxes can come
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.380]   in and help our young children or adult children plan for their future.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.140]   I wished I was able to contribute to a Roth IRA when I was growing up, but it only just
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.700]   began when I was growing up.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.300]   And so many of us didn't know much about it.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.580]   And then by the time I turned 25, well, I couldn't contribute anymore.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.600]   And so I just forgot about it.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.380]   But I don't forget about it now because I have two kids.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:26.460]   And I find it actually really exciting and somewhat of a challenge to try to grow their
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.700]   Roth IRA portfolio large enough so that by the time they graduate high school or college,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.940]   they can hit the ground running and not feel so constrained by life's many inflationary
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.140]   expenses.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:43.460]   A diversification of retirement income sources is a good one.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.740]   Whether we pay taxes now or in the end, it's simply unavoidable.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.660]   We just have to decide what we think future tax rates will be.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.940]   And just like inflation.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.260]   Yeah, it's a 40 plus year downward trend.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.940]   We've had a couple years of anomaly spikes, right?
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.940]   2022 and 2023.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.700]   But I think that trend is going to go back down.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.100]   So we could have several years of anomaly spikes of higher taxes, but then the people
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.860]   are going to get angry and they're going to vote the politicians out.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.740]   And then we're going to revert back to the long term trend since the 1950s of lower tax
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.360]   rates for longer.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   That's my opinion.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.900]   I'd love to hear yours.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.780]   If you want to run some smart scenarios about when to do a Roth IRA conversion for your
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:35.460]   retirement, check out new retirement at financialsamurai.com/nr.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.900]   I spoke to the founder, Steve Chen, and he said one of the most popular tools they have
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.460]   is the Roth Conversion Explorer.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.280]   It enables you to test out your Roth IRA conversion plan under various tax and wealth scenarios.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   This is what we all want.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.580]   So I do recommend you sign up and check it out.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:58.140]   Then you can get a better idea of exactly what your tax liability will be in the future.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.700]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.660]   I'm not a tax professional, but I'm a tax enthusiast who studies tax law every single
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:11.040]   year because it's our largest ongoing liability that we cannot escape.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.860]   So if you enjoy this podcast, others will too.

[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.420]   There are a lot of things that I don't think about that you share based on your experience.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.100]   And many of these insights are so wonderful.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.340]   You know, we're talking about retirement planning in your mid sixties and seventies,
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.620]   and I'm only 45.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.180]   So I don't know what I don't know.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.340]   So please, if you have thoughts and experiences that I'm missing, please share with the community.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.060]   And this is the best way to learn.
