[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, today's APJ episode deals with mature themes.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So just a heads up. Particularly, Pastor John deals here
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   with the world's infatuation with lust and
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   how to escape it. The clip is from a 2004 sermon
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Pastor John had been preaching on Romans 11, verses 32
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and 33. A text that tells us, quote, "God has
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   on all." End quote. Verse 32 is
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   an astonishing claim. So astonishing that Paul moves
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   directly into worship when he next says, "Oh,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God, how
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   unsearchable are his judgments, and how inscrutable his ways."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Late in his 2004 sermon, as
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   he turned to celebrate the majesty of our sovereign God so clearly on
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   display in this text, Pastor John looked at some troubling social trends
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   that he noticed. Here he is.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So if you come to the end of this message, hearing me open verses 30
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and 31 and 32, and you're scratching your head
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and you're saying, "I don't get it. How can this be?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   How can God be sovereign over and plan periods of disobedience?"
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Then know that you're in good company, because
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   the Apostle Paul himself responded to his own teaching
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   unsearchable, inscrutable.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So his words, not mine. I use the words, "Astonishing, shocking," which is
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   why I prayed for you at the beginning, "Go down to the deeps of our heart,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Lord, and cut away the calluses on the capacities to be
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   shocked." It's very intentional that Paul
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   is doing this. Verse 33 proves it.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He means to shock us. He means to astonish
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   us. He means to put our hands over our mouths and say, "I don't get it!
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I can't explain it! It's inscrutable!
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's unsearchable!" He means to leave us there.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And so if you feel that way, don't
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   resent it. Learn as much as you can
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   from as much as he gives. These high things
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   about God that we're about to look at, God's governing
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   history from beginning to end, disobedience
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and obedience, all leading to the magnification
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   of His mercy, these high things are really relevant for your
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   daily life. Take sex, for
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   example. One of the main reasons that we are
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   drowning
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   today in America and in the church in an ocean of
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   lust and pornography, men and women,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   fornication, adultery, masturbation,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   exhibitionism, homosexuality, bestiality,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   rape, sexual innuendo on every screen
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   virtually, one of the reasons that the
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   church included is awash and drowning
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   in the sea is because we are
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   intellectually and emotionally
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   disconnected from
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   infinite soul-staggering divine
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   grandeur.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And instead, drowning in a sea of triviality,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   pettiness, banality, and silliness.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We have lost
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   by and large our capacity for
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   being staggered by divine grandeur
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and we live at a low dog-in-heat
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   level. TV is trivial.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Radio is trivial. Conversation
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   is trivial. Education is trivial.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Christian books are pressed by publishers to be trivial.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Worship styles become increasingly trivial.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   We trifle with our little jokey ways so that
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   everybody will feel kind of comfortable because that's what they feel when they
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   watch TV and if they can feel comfortable at home in our jokey churches
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   they might come back. We have lost
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   our capacity to be staggered by the terrifyingly
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   joyous dread and peace of
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   an infinitely untouchable embracing God.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Life is just boring,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   humdrum, and when a creature
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   created by God to live in the
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   presence of God and to be staggered by the glory
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of his infinite power and justice and wisdom
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and truth and grace,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   when that creature swims in an
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   ocean of triviality, it must be
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that he will embrace the best buzz available
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and it is sex.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So many of you
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   have become fish and therefore
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   do not even miss air anymore.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You just can't imagine what I'm talking about.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   There's another air to breathe.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   There's another level of joy. There's another experience
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   of magnificent and grander and staggering, mouth-shutting,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   unsearchable, unspeakable divine truth
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   that if you lived there, you wouldn't want to be a dog in heat
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   in front of your monitor anymore.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You get victory over your life
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   of lowness, but you've become a fish.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's all you drink is triviality.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The best buzz you can imagine is a low buzz.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Which is why I prayed at the beginning
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   of this service that God would do what I can't do.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I can't awaken the taste buds for the divine.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   God can.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The deepest cure for our pitiful addictions
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   is not any mental strategies. I have them.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I use them. I teach them. I've got my own lust strategies.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That's not the deepest cure. The deepest cure
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   is to be intellectually, and I underline that word.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I'm not going to apologize for theology and doctrine and head,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but I'm going to now say the second one. The deepest cure
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   is to be intellectually and emotionally
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   staggered by God.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And there's this tremendous American
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   pragmatic pressure not to form churches
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   like that. Not to write books
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   like that. Not to have music like that. But to keep everything
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   low and chatty and comfortable and silly and trivial and
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   small.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   This is so sad. Sex is
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   one of the hundred issues that will overwhelm you and
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   debase you if your life is
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   out of touch with the magnificence of God.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Well, I will do my best
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   to stagger you because I feel
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   bound by Scripture to help you get to verse 33
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   emotionally. Oh, the depth
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God. I don't get it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It is unscrutable. His ways are unsearchable. His thoughts
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   are beyond me. I bow. I put my hand over my mouth. I humble myself.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I love this God. I will not just
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   sit in front of my monitor and look.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I will stand up. I will walk outside in the cold
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and look up and say, "The heavens are declaring the glory of God.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Make me pure."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Come on. Come on, America.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Wake up to reality.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Don't live in the ocean of triviality, swimming
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   around fearing air.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Be a man. Be a woman.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Not a dog in hate.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   2004 sermon titled, "God's Design for History, the Glory of His Mercy."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   The clip was sent to us by a long-time listener to the podcast
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   named Andy, who calls it, "One of my all-time favorite clips of Pastor John."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I can see why. As always, you can find
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   that full sermon at DesiringGod.org. Again, it's titled,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "God's Design for History, the Glory of His Mercy."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Thank you, Andy, for today's sermon clip. All of our clips are now crowdsourced. You tell us
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life. We share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If you have one, email me. Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the timestamp
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   of when the clip happens in the audio and how it impacted you.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. That's an email address.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   We'll see you back here on Friday. We're going to talk about how
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   does chronic pain glorify God?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's a heavy email. Next up on Friday. We'll see you then.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   [no audio]
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   [no audio]
