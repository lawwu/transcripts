[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   We're about to begin our third and final day of the 2014 Pastors Conference here in Minneapolis
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.520]   and it's been a wonderful conference, so thank you for your prayers over the last few days.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.720]   Today's APJ question is about the Gospel and it comes from Melody in Ithaca, New York.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.660]   She writes, "Pastor John, how can it be just to punish someone innocent in the place of
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.660]   someone guilty?
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.160]   I've heard it said that the cross was unfair, but I can't bring myself to say that God would
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.960]   do anything that's unfair."
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   No, we surely cannot say that God would do anything unfair and that is not a small question,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.080]   it's a biblical question.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:50.200]   Justice does demand that punishment happen to the one who committed the sin.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.480]   Deuteronomy 24, 16, "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   children be put to death because of their fathers.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.040]   Each one shall be put to death for his own sin."
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040]   Period.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.760]   That's why the cross is an offense to the Jews and should it be?
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.840]   That's the question.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840]   Is it just?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.120]   Does it break God's law?
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.600]   Did God break God's law in presuming to cause Christ to be a substitute?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.240]   And it's the very heart of the Gospel, so you can't ask a question any more essential
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   than this because 1 Corinthians 15, 3 says, "Christ died for our sins."
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.280]   1 Peter 3, 18, "Christ suffered once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous."
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.520]   Just as blunt as it could be that this seems wrong.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.280]   How can a righteous person die in place of an unrighteous person?
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.960]   He didn't do the sin.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   Or Isaiah 53, "We esteemed him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.320]   He was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   He was crushed for our iniquities."
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   So her question is massively central, massively important.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.640]   How is it just?
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.800]   And over the years of my reflecting about this, two different ways of answering the
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.400]   question have seemed helpful.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.080]   I'll give you both of them as quick as I can.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.160]   The first one is the doctrine of union with Christ.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:27.000]   God has the right and the ability to constitute, to make a union between Adam and humanity
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.920]   so that when Adam fell, we all fell in him, so that the punishment that came on Adam also
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.680]   came on us because we were in union with Adam.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.840]   And God can do that.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.600]   He can constitute a union.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.280]   I would recommend Ever's book on Original Sin.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.640]   That was the most helpful of anything I've ever read on how God does that.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   Because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man on everyone.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.000]   As one trespass led to condemnation for all, Romans 5, 18.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.640]   And the same principle is operating when Christ, the new Adam, dies for his people, the new
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   humanity.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   "For as by one man's obedience the many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience the
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.720]   many will be made righteous."
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   So the reason Christ can bear our punishment and become our righteousness is that we are
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.840]   in him.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.400]   There's a union that God constituted between us and Christ that makes his death our death.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.680]   2 Corinthians 5, 21.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.640]   "For our sake God made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him, in union with him,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.400]   we might become the righteousness of God."
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.440]   So this union does not exist between a son and a father.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.760]   So it would be unjust for a father to be punished for his son, like Deuteronomy says.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   God established a union between Christ and his people, and that's unique.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.240]   And only God can create that union, and that establishes Christ as our representative in
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   such a full way that it's virtually true that we are being punished in him.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.520]   That's the first way to think about it.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   Here's the second way, and this comes from Anselm.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.200]   And I think Anselm's book, "Why the God-Man," is massively important.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.520]   There are two main reasons why a mother cannot justly go to jail and serve the rest of her
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.320]   son's life sentence while the son goes free.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Number one, the crime against the state, the crime was against the state, and the mother's
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.200]   willingness to go to jail does not repair the injury done to the rights and the honor
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.800]   of the state.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.600]   It's a sign of compassion for her son.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.120]   The worth of the criminal to her, not the worth of the honor of the law, is her main
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   concern.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.480]   But with Christ, it is different.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.280]   Christ did come to vindicate the righteousness of God, Romans 3.25, and he did come to repair
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   the glory that was done to his father in our sin, John 12.27, "For this purpose I have
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   come.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120]   Father, glorify your name."
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   So that's the first difference.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   Second difference is this mother's desire for her son to go free provides no guarantee
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.800]   that this will not release a criminal onto the community and make him law-abiding.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.600]   There's nothing certain about that at all, and it looks like we're playing fast and loose
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.640]   with whether criminals go free.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.720]   That's not the case with Christ, and this is unique to Christ.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.080]   Everyone whom he saves by dying for them, he sanctifies.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.920]   That's the point of Romans 6.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.380]   When he died for us, we died in him.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.520]   Our old self was killed, was dead, and therefore substitution is always transformation.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   Substance not true in ordinary jurisprudence.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.580]   So those are my two ways of approaching this problem.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.840]   The one is union with Christ, and the other is the difference, the deep differences between
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.860]   the way Christ provides a substitute for us and the way, say, a typical mom would try
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.520]   to take the place of her son in prison.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.360]   Yeah, that's very good, Pastor John.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   And this conversation reminds me of our recent podcast, which was titled "Muslims vs.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.720]   Christians on the Sovereignty of God," where you talked about God's wrath, justice, and
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.600]   sovereignty in contrast to Islam.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.360]   That was episode number 234 in the Ask Pastor John archive.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.240]   Tomorrow we'll talk about what you, Pastor John, believe to be the single most important
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   verse in all of the Bible.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.760]   Hmm, I'm very curious about which verse you're going to choose.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.260]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.120]   [END]
