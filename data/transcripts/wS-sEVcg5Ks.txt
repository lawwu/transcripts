[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.580]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.520]   We start this new week with an email from a listener named Shannon.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.260]   Shannon is wondering if personal suffering is paradoxical for those of us who put so
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.280]   much stress on joy, for us Christian hedonists.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   Here's her email.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.240]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for the APJ podcast.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.840]   My question is about 1 Peter 4, verses 1 to 2.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.880]   There appears to be a point of arrival when we no longer live for human passions but for
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.680]   God's will.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.640]   As a Christian hedonist, do you see an irony that my sinfulness will cease only after I
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.600]   have suffered for a certain amount of time, thus showing my life is not to live for my
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.520]   own sinful pleasure but to pursue God as my greatest treasure?
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.880]   Is suffering a paradox for Christian hedonists?
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.400]   Okay, there are two, at least I hear, two distinct issues to deal with here.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:21.060]   One is whether Shannon is interpreting 1 Peter 4, verse 1 correctly, and the other is whether
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.300]   suffering is indeed appointed by God as a means by which sin is rooted out of our lives
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:37.900]   and is therefore a means by which we come to enjoy Christ more, more fully, as our supreme
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900]   treasure.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.620]   That's the kind of paradox she's saying.
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100]   If that's true, then we're going to embrace suffering as Christian hedonists, and she
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.900]   regards that as kind of paradoxical.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.380]   So let me try to take those one at a time because they really are separate issues.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.820]   First, a few words about the meaning of 1 Peter 4, verse 1, where Peter says, so this
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.820]   is a quote from 4, verse 1, "Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.940]   with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.940]   sin."
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.020]   Now, I have good friends, and name them, a lot of our listeners would know who they're
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.020]   talking about.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.860]   They're pretty famous folks.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940]   I have good friends who interpret this verse differently than I do, and they've both written
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.780]   commentaries and they've studied this more than I have.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.220]   And I'm not infallible, as everybody knows.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.860]   They say that arming yourself with the same way of thinking as Christ, who suffered, means
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.420]   that you resolve not to sin, even if it costs you suffering.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.860]   And if you do that, it is evidence that you have in principle ceased from sin and are
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.980]   willing to endure the maligning referred to in verse 4, something like that.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.860]   It's kind of complicated.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.380]   But I have a hard time laying that interpretation on the text and seeing it clearly.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.460]   Here's what I think Peter meant, and the folks will have to study this out for themselves.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.340]   The criticism that my interpretation usually gets is that it looks like I've just taken
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.340]   it over from the Apostle Paul.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.940]   And that's not fair.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.940]   That's cheating.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.540]   You can't run over to Romans 6 and grab an interpretation and come squish it into 1 Peter.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.540]   I get that, but I don't think so.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.660]   If I thought that's what I was doing, I would back down.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.460]   Paul says in Romans 6—I'll give you the parallel that is so remarkable.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:52.380]   Romans 6.6, he says, "We know that our old self was crucified with Christ in order that
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.780]   the body of sin might be brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.340]   sin, for the one who has died has been set free from sin."
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.180]   That's Paul's quote.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.060]   That's very close to Peter saying, "Whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.060]   sin."
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.740]   So, Paul is saying that when Christ suffered and died, we Christians, by union with him
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.660]   through faith, also suffered and died, and that this death with Christ was a decisive
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.820]   death blow to our life of sinning.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.460]   We are an essentially new person in Christ, and the mark of the newness is that we hate
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.060]   our sin and we make war on it and we put it to death by the Spirit.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.980]   Now that's essentially what I think Peter means in 1 Peter 4.1, but not because Paul
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.460]   said it so well, but because Peter's context points in this direction.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:17.380]   In 1 Peter 3.18, just a few verses earlier, he says, "Christ also suffered once for
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:26.900]   sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.460]   in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit."
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:39.780]   So, Christ's suffering, which 1 Peter 4.1 refers to, Christ's suffering in this verse
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.020]   is his death.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.300]   He suffered unto death.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.140]   He suffered once, that is, he was put to death in the flesh.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:54.900]   So when 1 Peter 4.1 says, "Christ suffered in the flesh, so whoever has suffered in the
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.500]   flesh has ceased from sin," the natural meaning is Christ died.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:07.260]   So whoever has died with him, I interpret, has ceased from sin.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:15.540]   Now what makes that connection even more plain, I think, is chapter 2, verse 24, where Peter
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:23.180]   says, "He," that is, Christ, "bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.780]   die to sin."
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.620]   That's a really amazing parallel to Paul and to chapter 4, verse 1 in 1 Peter, to die
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.180]   to sin and to live to righteousness.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:44.100]   Christ died for our sins, that we might experience his death as our death, and thus die to our
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.700]   sins, that is, be set free from the dominion of sinning.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:07:00.500]   So I don't think it's unique to Paul at all to say, as Peter does in 4.1, paraphrasing
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:10.580]   2.24, "Christ suffered," that is, he died, therefore, have that mindset because you died
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:18.100]   with him and the effect of that death with him was that your old sin-loving self died
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:26.060]   and now you have ceased from your bondage to sin and are launched into a life of warfare
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.780]   in which sin will not have dominion over you.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:38.140]   I don't think Shannon is right, therefore, to say that 1 Peter 4.1 teaches—this is
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:46.700]   a quote from her question—"My sinfulness will cease only after I have suffered for
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.700]   a certain amount of time."
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:58.380]   I think the point is, my bent towards sinning received a mortal blow when Christ died for
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.260]   my sin and I died with him.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:08.860]   So I don't think she set things up correctly, but now we turn to the second issue where
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.500]   she's on track.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.220]   That happens a lot of times, right?
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.060]   You see something in a text, you don't get the text quite right, but the conclusion you
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.660]   draw is pretty good.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:25.660]   So here's the second issue, namely, whether suffering is indeed appointed by God as a
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:33.200]   means by which sin is rooted out of our lives and is therefore a means by which I come to
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.460]   enjoy Christ more fully as my supreme treasure.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:44.180]   Now that's a different issue, and Shannon's way of saying it is that this would be a paradox
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.880]   for a Christian hedonist, that is, somebody like me who believes that God is most glorified
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.580]   in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:59.020]   She thinks that would be a paradox, namely, since sin diminishes our greatest and longest
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:06.820]   joy, yes it does, joy in Christ as our supreme treasure, that's the greatest and longest
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:15.720]   joy, therefore Christian hedonists should welcome God-appointed suffering as a means
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.300]   of killing the very thing, sin, that robs us of our greatest joy, namely sin.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.460]   That's the paradox, and I think that's right.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.980]   I think that's basically right.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.300]   She's onto something there.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:34.520]   One of the reasons God appoints suffering for his children is to wean us off of reliance
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   upon the world whose pleasures are deceitful, and they rob us of the greatest pleasures
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.660]   at God's right hand.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.620]   And we could show this from a lot of places in the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 1, 8,
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:57.540]   9, 2 Corinthians 12, 7 to 10, but let me just glance briefly at Hebrews 12, 6 to 11.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.180]   So it says, "The Lord disciplines the one he loves."
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.340]   That's like a spanking, it's like suffering he brings into our lives.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:12.940]   "The Lord disciplines the one whom he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives."
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.860]   It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.620]   God is treating you as sons, loved sons.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:28.580]   So God brings suffering into the lives of his children, and it is a sign of his love,
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.580]   not his wrath.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.220]   It's for our good, our joy, our holiness.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.580]   So the writer goes on.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.420]   Here's verse 10 of Hebrews 12.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:44.400]   "He disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.500]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful."
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.900]   Yes, it does, rather than pleasant.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:58.500]   But later, "it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   by it."
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:07.620]   So he contrasts the painful, unpleasant experience of suffering—that's the discipline of the
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:14.380]   Father—with the peaceful and pleasant fruit of righteousness.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.700]   So yes, Shannon is right in principle.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:25.420]   I don't think this is the point of 1 Peter 4:1, but it is the point of many texts in
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.860]   the Bible.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:34.980]   God loves his children, and he knows better than any human physician what measures of
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:44.060]   displeasure are needed to kill the sins that rob us of the greatest pleasures, namely the
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:50.980]   ones in God's presence, with Jesus as our greatest treasure.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   So good.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:58.020]   Yeah, the Christian hedonist welcomes God-appointed suffering as a means of killing the very thing,
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.700]   the sin, that robs us of our greatest joy in God.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.940]   That is so good, so important.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.940]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.940]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.140]   If you have a question for us, like Shannon did today, email us.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   Do it from our online home at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.380]   And speaking of Paul on suffering, Philippians 3 verses 1 to 14 comes to my mind when it
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.700]   comes to preparing for personal suffering.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.540]   I know that's a text that you have explained before, Pastor John, and we're going to look
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.380]   at that text next time when we return.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.740]   What is step one in preparing for suffering?
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.620]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.700]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.020]   See you then.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.420]   [END]
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   1.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   What is step one in preparing for suffering?
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   2.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.420]   What is the most important thing that God has given you?
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.420]   3.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.420]   What is the most important thing that God has given you?
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.420]   4.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   What is the most important thing that God has given you?
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.420]   5.
