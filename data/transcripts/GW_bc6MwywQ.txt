[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   - Hello everyone, welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   I know many of you listen through the car radio
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560]   or through a podcast app on your car speakers
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.840]   with young kids in tow,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.860]   and you're not always able to see the episode titles.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.900]   Just wanna give you a little heads up
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960]   that today's episode is sensitive.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.620]   Today's question comes from
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.920]   an international listener named David.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920]   Hello, Pastor John, my thoughts keep returning
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160]   to Proverbs 2.19.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.960]   It says, "None who go to her come back,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.400]   "nor do they regain the paths of life."
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   Please, I need a deeper clarification on this verse
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.160]   because I'm frightened due to a recent experience.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880]   I'm a teenage Christian boy, 17 years old.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.560]   Recently, I was carried away by my lust
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.440]   and foolishly decided to look for a temporary sexual partner
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.760]   through a hookup site online.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.160]   I made contact with two women and they made promises
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.640]   saying that they would give their bodies to me
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.000]   in exchange for money.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.720]   I paid them the money online,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.960]   but they scammed me and never showed up.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.160]   When this happened, I felt really stupid
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.520]   and angry with myself.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580]   I lost about $100.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.880]   Later, I was able to reflect and see that what I did
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.560]   was wrong and that I deserved the loss.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.880]   I'm really grateful to God because I feel
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.680]   that he allowed the scam to come my way
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.080]   because he was preventing me from losing my virginity.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.840]   But I feel scared that I even went this far in the process.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   Even in seeking out a prostitute,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.120]   I feel like I've crossed a line I cannot return from.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.920]   Pastor John, have I?
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   - My answer very simply is I do not know
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.780]   if David has crossed a line.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.280]   I don't know whether he's crossed a line
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.560]   that cannot, from which he cannot return.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   But I can say to him that having sex
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.880]   with a prostitute or intending to and paying for it
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.160]   is not beyond God's forgiveness
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440]   if there is genuine repentance.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.980]   That is an authentic repudiation of the ugliness
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980]   of that sin and a turning to Christ for mercy
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.400]   and for the power of reformation
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.580]   and for the enjoyment of Christ himself
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.300]   as a superior pleasure to all such sins.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.140]   The reason I say that I don't know
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.160]   whether David has crossed the line
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.960]   is because I do believe there is such a thing
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.560]   as crossing the line from which
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.720]   we will never be able to return.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.880]   Now, I know that's very frightening.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.260]   It's intended to be very frightening.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.360]   But the very text that teaches that
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   also teaches that genuine repentance, if it happens,
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.100]   does always bring God's forgiveness.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.400]   Here's the text, Hebrews 12, 15 to 17.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   "See to it that no one is sexually immoral
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   "or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.100]   "for a single meal.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.240]   "For you know that afterward,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   "when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.880]   "for he found no place of repentance,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   "though he sought it with tears."
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   Now, notice, it does not say that he genuinely repented
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.760]   and sought forgiveness, but couldn't find it.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.880]   Though he repented, that's not what it says.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   What it says is that he was not able to repent.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.340]   That's the line that you can cross.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.340]   His sin had brought such bondage and deception
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.040]   and distortion on his soul.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.120]   This is what happens in sexual sin.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.640]   Oh my goodness, it's horrific how insane
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.460]   sexual sin makes people.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.460]   It can distort the soul and decrease the soul's capacity
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.480]   so much that it is impossible then to authentically repent.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.520]   That's the frightening thing.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   And the implication is, if he had repented,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.520]   he would have received the blessing of the inheritance.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.560]   He would have been forgiven.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   That is the standing invitation of New Testament gospel.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.520]   First John 1, 9.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.960]   to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.560]   from all unrighteousness.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.640]   That's a glorious, glorious, precious promise.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   And it does not say, well, except for prostitution
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.760]   or except for adultery or except for rape
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.240]   or except for really outrageous sins.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.800]   No, it does not say that.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.180]   If we confess our sins, if we agree with God
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.240]   all the way down, that we are hopeless
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.000]   and he is merciful and powerful and worthy
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.440]   and that Christ is enough in his death and resurrection
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.280]   and as a treasure for our lives,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   if we confess, he forgives all of it.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   So when I say there is a line that we can cross
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   after which God will not grant us repentance,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   I do not have in mind a kind of sinning,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.640]   a kind of really gross sin.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.280]   So if you do that, then you've crossed the line.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.240]   That's not the line.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.040]   It's not the kind of sin that is unforgivable.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   It's the kind of hardness that one reaches in sinning
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.880]   from which he cannot repent.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.960]   You can't bring yourself to be set free
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.840]   from your love of sin.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.600]   And the Bible tells us nothing definite
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   about which sins or what duration of sinning
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.160]   or what frequency of sinning crosses that line.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.760]   It simply says, there's a line after which
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.520]   we may seek repentance with tears
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   and not be able to find it.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.320]   That's a strong warning to flee every temptation.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.880]   Let no one think they can say,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.760]   well, I'm about 10 temptations away from that line.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   You have no idea how close you may be to that line.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.240]   So on what basis then do I say to David
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.640]   that having sex with a prostitute
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.560]   or intending to and paying for it
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.880]   is not beyond God's forgiveness
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   if there's genuine repentance?
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   How can I say that?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.220]   Because he's pointing to Proverbs 2.19,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.440]   which seems to say the opposite.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.200]   She, namely this forbidden woman, the prostitute,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.360]   forsakes the companion of her youth,
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.400]   forgets the covenant of her God,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.520]   for her house sinks down to death.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.640]   Her paths are to the departed.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   None who go to her come back,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   nor do they regain the paths of life.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.540]   That's the sentence that is scaring David to death
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.020]   and it ought to.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.200]   That's very strong language.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.900]   None come back from her bed to the paths of life.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.980]   It's a very strong warning
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.420]   that there is a deadly drug in the embrace of a prostitute
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.920]   and the experience of thousands is that there's no escape.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.160]   But it's the nature of Proverbs
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.080]   to generalize in terms like this.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Very often Proverbs state things in absolute terms
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.300]   when we know and they imply
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.080]   that the absoluteness is not absolute.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.700]   They are generalizations rather than absolutes
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.100]   with no exceptions.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.180]   Now here's the way we know this,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.020]   that this is the nature of Proverbs.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.380]   In Proverbs 26, four, it says,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.300]   answer not a fool according to his folly,
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.900]   lest you be like him yourself.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.360]   Now, if you just took that verse by itself,
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.820]   you'd say that's absolute.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.780]   Never do that. Never, never, never.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.020]   It says answer not a fool according to his folly.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.020]   But the next verse, verse five says,
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.620]   answer a fool according to his folly,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.980]   lest he be wise in his own eyes.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.220]   And that one sounds absolute.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.220]   It's the nature of a proverb to state general wisdom
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.820]   without calling attention each time to the exceptions.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.920]   So when Proverbs 2, 19 says,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.900]   no one who goes to her comes back.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   The point is be that fearful of the insanity
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.860]   of uniting your body to a prostitute.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.700]   People don't come back.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.460]   They go over the cliff.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.740]   That's what happens.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.340]   And he doesn't bother to say almost always.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.500]   But here's the evidence from the New Testament
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   that prostitution is not always unforgivable.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.740]   It's not beyond forgiveness.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.140]   First Corinthians 5, 1 goes like this.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.660]   This is Paul confronting an immorality
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.100]   in the church in Corinth worse than prostitution.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   He says this, it is actually reported
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.580]   that there is sexual immorality among you
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.580]   of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:30.920]   for a man has his father's wife.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.900]   And you are arrogant, ought you not rather to mourn?
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.160]   Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.180]   You are to deliver this man to Satan
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.700]   for the destruction of his flesh
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.700]   so that, here it comes, his spirit may be saved.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.580]   In the day of the Lord.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.060]   So there it is.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.900]   So that his spirit may be saved.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.020]   He can be saved, he can be forgiven
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.020]   for this outrageous offense against secular
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   and Christian morality.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.360]   If he will be saved, he was forgiven.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.180]   Evidently the hope is that in delivering him to Satan,
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.620]   something terrible will happen to him
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.640]   to destroy his flesh and lead his soul
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.960]   to genuine repentance.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.740]   Because if there's repentance,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.140]   there will be forgiveness and salvation
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.620]   even for sexual sin that is so outrageous
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.200]   the pagan world thinks it's reprehensible.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   So it is right for David to tremble because of his sin
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.820]   and to hear the warnings of scripture with fear.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.980]   But it is also right for David to take heart
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.480]   from the gospel offer that if we will repent
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.340]   and confess our sins, God is faithful
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.300]   and will forgive our sins
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.380]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.420]   even the unrighteousness of unspeakable sexual sin.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.420]   - That's a good word of warning and of hope.

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.580]   Well, in Romans 1:5, the Apostle Paul talks about
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.120]   the obedience of faith, as the ESV puts it,
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.220]   or more clearly, the obedience that comes from faith,
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.020]   as the NIV puts it.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.740]   We obey God only by faith in God.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.540]   Faithless obedience is a fiction.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.700]   And Pastor John's gonna explain why on Wednesday.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.820]   I'm Tony Reinke.
