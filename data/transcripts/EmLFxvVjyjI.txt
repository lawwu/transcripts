[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Pastor John, as someone who enjoys writing, I am interested to hear your
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.760]   thoughts about a writer's influence, how he or she engages a reader with the
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.160]   written word. And you rather strongly encourage writers to better appreciate
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.080]   the influence that they can have on those readers. Explain this for us,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.760]   explain the importance of a writer's influence. I tweeted recently that if
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.520]   you're not praying that what you write influence people, is it because you don't
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.240]   believe in what you say and think it doesn't matter, or is it because you don't
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.800]   think people matter? Which means that I think it's wrong not to want
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   to influence people when you write. Because Jesus or Paul said, "Let
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.800]   everything be done in love," and he said, "Do all to the glory of God." So when we're
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.120]   writing, either we're loving people or we're not. We should be loving people, and
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.440]   we're either seeking to glorify God or we're not. We should be seeking to
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.120]   glorify God. And I think the way you love people is by influencing them,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.600]   persuading them, winning them, awakening them to delight in God above all things.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.240]   Which means that whenever you write, you should be writing in such a way as to
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.160]   make God look better than anything else in the world, to make the path of sin
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   look worse than anything else in the world, and to make the path of
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   righteousness look beautiful in spite of all the difficulties that the path of
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.280]   obedience might bring. So whether you're writing fiction, or whether you're
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   writing a blog, or whether you're writing a poem, or whether you're writing a book,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.000]   a theological treatise, it seems to me that love and the glory of God dictate
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.960]   that you can't be indifferent to whether you want people to be affected by this.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.920]   You want them to think true thoughts about God and life, and you want them to
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.400]   feel appropriate affections for God and about sin and life, and therefore writing
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.640]   is simply an extension of living. And living is to be lived for love for
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.280]   people and for the glory of God. And when you start there, then you
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.960]   think backwards into, "Okay, what does that mean for the kinds of words that I use,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.920]   the kind of sentences I use, the paragraphs I use, the length of the things
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.320]   I use, cultural illustrations?" And you begin to think through all the
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.440]   applications for writing. But yeah, I start with the assumption that I'm on
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.520]   the planet to influence people. Pastor John, as you write, as you look at the
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.960]   screen of your computer, are you conscious of your readers in that moment
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.560]   of how you're trying to influence them?
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.520]   That's a really good question. I've heard somebody say one time, and they ask him,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   "Who does he write for?" He says, "He writes for people like him." I'm not a very good
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.280]   example of one who can crawl inside the skin of a particular age group or
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.240]   cultural segment. What I feel like God has gifted me somewhat in is being able
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.320]   to crawl inside the skin of a human. And the way I've gotten to know humans
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:53.760]   mainly is by knowing John Piper. My sins, my worries, my longings, I'm so
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.440]   introspectively driven on these things and so second-guessing about everything
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.280]   I do that I think I've gotten to know this human pretty well. And then I do try
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   to read and watch. So I'm aware of the effects that I write, but I'm generally
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.600]   not saying this segment of people, let's say from 18 to 25, think this way.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.520]   Therefore, I will say this. My mind just doesn't work like that. But as I'm
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.640]   writing, I do feel like if I say it this way, it's going to be off-putting. If I say
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.960]   it this way, it will be acceptable, and yet it won't have any impact. I've got to find a
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:48.240]   way in between off-putting and blah, no impact, that penetrates the heart. And
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.360]   so at that point, I'm thinking very hard about how I think what I write will be
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.600]   heard. It's just that I don't tend to categorize audiences. I'm probably just
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.840]   doing it intuitively because I know that if I were among, if I were writing
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   explicitly for people who say hadn't never heard of Jesus, they'd
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   never heard of Jesus, well, I would clearly write differently than if I were
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.840]   writing for somebody who did. So I do have a kind of generic audience
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   with some presuppositions in my mind when I write, but not very good focusing
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.960]   on particular groups. So how much of your writing really results in personal
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:43.840]   edification then? Always. I mean, I don't ever... Writing for me is a
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.440]   devotional exercise or an intellectual exercise by which I am ever seeking to
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.800]   see what I'm saying and feel what I'm saying. And therefore it has become... This
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.700]   is why I would write quite apart from any publishing. You know, if the
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.040]   Lord said to me, "No more publishing," goodness, I wouldn't stop writing. He would
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.400]   say, "I'm not gonna let anybody read for the rest of your life, anything you
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.120]   write." Well, I wouldn't stop writing. I would just write, put it in a notebook,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.360]   and throw it in a basket somewhere or whatever. Because writing for me has
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   become a way of seeing and a way of feeling. And so my answer is, I'm
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   always writing for my own edification, my own growth in knowledge, and my own
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.040]   awakening to the kinds of affections that I think one ought to have for God.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.240]   And it's just stunning to me. I've recommended to people, if they say, "I'm
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.880]   stuck in my devotions," I just say, "Well, just write the text. Start there. Just
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.440]   write the text. And as you're writing, if you get an idea, write something else, too.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.140]   But just write the text." Because for whatever reason, for some people, putting
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.820]   things on paper, whether with a pen or with a computer, actually causes
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.320]   thoughts to happen that you wouldn't have any other way. I generally don't
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.180]   even have it until I write it. My head is generally in such a muddle until I start
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.120]   writing. When we were talking about the pastoral implications of the historical
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.560]   Adam, when somebody asked me about that who wrote to me a few days ago,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.880]   everything was a muddle in my head. I had no idea what I would say. And as soon as
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.960]   I started writing, eight ideas came to my mind. Because as I wrote one, I saw an
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.720]   implication, and that had to be another one. And then I saw two other
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.600]   implications and questions, I had to answer those, and that became another one.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.440]   That wasn't happening until I put pen to paper.
