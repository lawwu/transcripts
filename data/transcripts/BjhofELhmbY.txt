[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   And we are back again for another week and for another Fourth of July on this podcast.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.720]   I think it's the fourth time an episode has landed square on the holiday, at least our
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.720]   fourth.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.760]   So happy Independence Day for those of you here in the States.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.960]   If the inbox is any indicator, questions over politics and patriotism in the pulpit are
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   perennial concerns for you all listening.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.600]   When better then to broach the topic than on a day like today?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.320]   Jameson, a pastor in Virginia, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.160]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.800]   I admire your approach to politics and patriotism.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.080]   You seem to be very careful here, even when the heat is turned up in election times and
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.720]   pastors feel social pressure to endorse specific candidates, you notoriously refrain from participating.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.560]   As you have watched this impulse in American Christian life for many decades, this impulse
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.800]   among Christian leaders to periodically endorse candidates and to get involved in politics,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.640]   what observations have you drawn from your decades of refraining?
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.720]   Maybe the most important or helpful thing that I can do in response to this question
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   is to point to passages of Scripture that capture the emphasis I think is needed, not
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.240]   just in the American church, but in the global church, the church around the world, because
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.120]   the tendency to confuse and combine Christian identity and its earthly expression, the church,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:54.920]   the tendency to confuse and combine Christian identity with political identity, ethnic identity,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.680]   national identity, or any other earthly identity, that conflating tendency is so strong and
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.800]   I think so destructive to the radical call of the gospel that it needs steadfast resistance
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.480]   generation after generation.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.800]   So my burden is to join forces with the Bible, as I understand it, and millions of faithful
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:36.160]   Christians to encourage and nurture a faithful Christian identity that will survive and thrive
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.040]   with faith and hope and joy and love and purity, whether America survives or Brazil survives
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.000]   or Britain survives or China survives or Russia survives or India survives or not.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.560]   So let me point to six kinds of passages that shape my passions in that direction.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.980]   Number one, Jesus said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.780]   If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting that I might not be delivered
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:21.320]   over to the Jews, but my kingdom is not from the world," John 18:36, from which I infer
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:31.040]   we better be very, very careful before we undertake any processes that involve force
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.160]   or coercion to put the kingdom of Christ in place.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:48.000]   Any identity that we can put in place by force or weapon or law is not the kingdom of Christ.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.740]   In this age, King Jesus is creating a people a very different way.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740]   That's number one.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:03.780]   Number two, Paul said in Colossians 1:13, "God has delivered us from the domain of darkness
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.900]   and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son."
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.200]   And again, Colossians 3, 1, "You have been raised with Christ.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.260]   Seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.220]   Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth, for you have
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.240]   died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.220]   When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will appear with him in glory."
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:42.460]   So our most fundamental and defining identity and location is the kingdom of Christ, not
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.580]   any kingdom on earth.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.340]   It is the right hand of God, not the right hand of any earthly power.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.780]   Our most essential life is Christ, and only when he comes will we be openly known for
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.980]   who we really are.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:11.060]   Number three, Philippians 3.20, "Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior,
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.820]   the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.420]   by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself."
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:30.460]   So no earthly citizenship, whether American or Russian or Chinese, has any ultimate allegiance
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.060]   of those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.900]   Our political allegiances are to Jesus.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.540]   No party, no nation, no ethnicity, no ideology has any ultimate claim on us.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.940]   Our decisive constitution is the word of God and no human document.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.540]   Number four, Peter says in 1 Peter 2.9, "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.540]   nation, a people for his own possession that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.140]   called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.540]   These are ethnically and politically shattering words.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:26.940]   Born-again Christians, real Christians, are a chosen race, genos eclecton, a holy nation,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.380]   ethnos hogion.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:39.340]   The kind of human we are and the kind of nation we belong to is not any longer our essential
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.000]   identity.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.940]   We are a new kind, a new nation.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:56.460]   None of the existing human realities, ethnic or national, is God's chosen and holy people.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.460]   Christians are a new thing, a new reality, a new people, a new nation, a new ethnicity
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.820]   and race, and we should bear witness to it.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:17.900]   Number five, therefore, Peter says in 1 Peter 2.11, "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.740]   exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh that wage war against your soul."
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.820]   Christians are not first Americans or Canadians or British or Russian or Nigerian.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.340]   In every nation, we are exiles.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.340]   Let that sink in.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.580]   I want to scream that from the top of the buildings to every nationalistic tendency.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.660]   In every nation, we are exiles.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.780]   Jesus said, "If you were of the world, the world would love its own, but because you
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.060]   are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.300]   John 15, 19.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:04.300]   If you are going to run for office, be sure to inform your constituency that you are a
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.560]   resident alien.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:14.660]   Your primary citizenship and allegiance are the kingdom of Christ.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:22.220]   Number six, Peter said in 1 Peter 2.13-16, "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.860]   institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme or to governors as sent by him
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.900]   to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good, for this is the will of
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.860]   God that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people."
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:45.980]   Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.300]   as slaves of God.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:56.340]   In other words, realize as Christians that you are free.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:02.660]   Free from emperors, free from governors, free from presidents, free from worldly powers
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.700]   and parties.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.060]   We belong to God.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.400]   We are slaves of God, not any man.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.060]   We are his servants.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.300]   He owns us.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   We do his bidding.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:25.620]   And when the human state tells us to pay our taxes and keep the speed limit and shovel
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.820]   the snow off of our sidewalks, we do it.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.520]   Not because the state is our authority, but because God is.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.620]   We submit for his sake and in his limits.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:48.260]   Number seven, Jesus said in Matthew 28, 19-20, "Go therefore and make disciples of all
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.620]   nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.300]   them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.020]   And behold, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:08.020]   Now that does not mean go and turn pagan cultures into whitewashed tombs with the paint of so-called
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.540]   Christian externals.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.960]   We know that.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.500]   We know it doesn't mean that.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:24.620]   Because Jesus defines discipling nations, which is the neuter plural Greek word ethne,
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:35.180]   nations, he defines that by baptizing and teaching them and the them is masculine plural.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.280]   That's crucial.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.760]   You don't disciple political entities.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.240]   You don't disciple ethnic corporate realities.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.380]   You disciple them, autous, plural Greek, people that you can baptize.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:59.540]   In other words, our job is to so magnify Jesus and his saving work among all the peoples
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:06.900]   of the world, that individual human beings are brought from death to life and formed
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.980]   into the image of Christ.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:18.940]   In every race, ethnicity, nation, this new people, this chosen race, this holy nation
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:25.620]   among all the nations are to let our light so shine before others that they may see our
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.100]   good works and give glory to our Father who is in heaven.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.380]   Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evil
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:43.460]   doers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation, 1 Peter 2.11.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:54.740]   Now I have no illusions, Tony, that until Jesus comes, Christians will ever agree on
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:01.740]   precisely what it looks like in professional life and political life and cultural life
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.420]   for the church to be the kingdom of Christ.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.820]   A kingdom, Jesus says, that's not of this world.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.500]   But my encouragement to pastors is you don't need to figure that out.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.060]   You don't need to figure that out for all of your amazingly diverse people invested
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:29.180]   in a thousand ways in all kinds of cultural and professional and political endeavors.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.420]   You don't need to be the expert to figure all that out.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.100]   We're not smart enough.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:43.340]   Take these biblical truths and others that you see as relevant from scripture.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.540]   Call your people to radical allegiance to King Jesus.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.140]   Set them on a quest of lifelong learning and trust the Spirit of God in their lives.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.100]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.220]   So then there's no place in the Christian life for patriotism, right?
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.380]   Wrong, actually.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.260]   We have addressed this and looked at C.S. Lewis's category of store gay love.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.460]   Store gay love, a love of the familiar, a love of home, a healthy and a proper love
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.460]   of the fatherland.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.500]   If you want to dwell on that fact on this holiday, see four episodes in the archive
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.100]   that come to my mind on it.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.940]   I think there's at least four.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.340]   APJ is 125, 378, 893, and 1494.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.700]   Each of those are worth a listen.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.540]   Each available right now in our growing archive.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.500]   That's episodes 125, 378, 893, and 1494 on store gay love.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.620]   Those can be found at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.620]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.180]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.900]   Pastor John is going to introduce us to God's school of prayer.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.580]   We'll see you in a couple days and have a wonderful Fourth of July celebration.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.980]   For those of you in the States, we'll see you very soon.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.700]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:14:01.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
