[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   All right, I'm here at ShopCon 2024. Can you please introduce yourself?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Yeah, my name is Jeff Williams. I'm from Word of Grace Bible Church in Battleground, Washington.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   All right, and Jeff, you've been reading the LSB a little bit. What do you think?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   I have. In fact, I'm on the board of Grace to You, so I was involvedâ€”not involved directly,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   but I kept hearing about the status and its development or whatnot, and very excited when it was released.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And yes, I use it. It's not the primary version that we're using yet in our congregation,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   but I think that's just a matter of time.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Well, and I like the word "yet," right? It sounds like you guys are anticipating.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Jeff, we appreciate your faithful service all these years at Grace to You and the other ministries that you do.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I've bumped into you a few times, and I just want to say thank you for your faithful service.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Thank you, Gary. Thank you.
