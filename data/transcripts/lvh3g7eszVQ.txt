[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   If you get into the sauna the way I just described,
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.240]   not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.460]   twice a week or three times per week,
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.460]   you reduce the likelihood of dying
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.440]   of a cardiovascular event by 27%.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.720]   If you do it four or more times per week,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.960]   you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.840]   - Is there any scientific evidence
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.460]   that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.640]   - Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.580]   - Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.160]   I think Dorothy Parker said,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.520]   "The cure for boredom is curiosity.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.500]   There's no cure for curiosity."
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.360]   - The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.800]   his third time on this podcast.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.240]   He's a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.200]   and the host of one of the best,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.240]   the best, if you ask me,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240]   health and science podcast in the world
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   called Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.820]   Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.900]   Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.300]   and has quickly become a great friend.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.380]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.540]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820]   in the description.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.780]   And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.580]   We meet again, my friend.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.740]   We should talk on each other's podcast once a year.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.520]   I think we should make a deal.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.020]   I was just talking to the guys.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.340]   There's a show called "Louie."
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.580]   I don't know if you know it.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.420]   - Louis C.K.?
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.720]   - Yeah, with Louis C.K.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.340]   And there's this thing called "Bang Bang,"
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.660]   which people that are probably watching
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.540]   know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.540]   It's this worst possible thing you can do
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.980]   in terms of meals, which is you go to a restaurant,
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.500]   do a full meal, and then you go to another restaurant
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.340]   and do a full meal.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.260]   And you-- - Ugh.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.660]   - You-- (laughs)
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.500]   - Sounds brutal.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060]   - So they go Mexican, Italian, sushi, pizza, barbecue,
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.980]   IHOP, that one is disgusting.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.860]   This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.740]   - Last time we were hanging out,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.920]   we went to see Joe do comedy,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.300]   and then we went to eat Russian food.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.140]   - Yeah.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.500]   - And it was a particularly fun experience
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.860]   to go to a Russian restaurant.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.940]   I was the only person there that didn't speak Russian.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.780]   - Yeah.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.260]   - And eat Russian food with you.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.460]   And 'cause I felt walking in, they trusted you.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.820]   They didn't trust me.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.780]   - Yeah, the funny thing about the people there,
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.660]   they were talking to you in Russian,
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.140]   and then they refused to sort of switch to English,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.280]   even though they understood you speak no Russian.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.060]   This is Russian House in Austin, by the way.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.180]   Anyway, by way of question, what's the worst,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.180]   or the best, depending on your perspective, cheap meal?
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.540]   Let's call it a pigging out meal.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.220]   But it could be a cheap meal that you've ever had,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.660]   or you want to have that's on the bucket list,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.100]   or something that's in the past.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.340]   Where you did the, something like a bang bang,
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.140]   which is like, you're talking about
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.820]   multiple thousands of calories
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.100]   that you just feel horrible about yourself,
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.560]   but you still keep eating 'cause it's delicious,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.940]   but also great company.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.300]   Something about the atmosphere is just right.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.700]   Screw the diet, screw all the things you know,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.460]   or just like you should be doing,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.500]   but just throw it all out the window.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.340]   - I've done that.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.940]   - Multiple times. - Several times.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.140]   Yeah, I don't do this anymore,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.260]   but the entire time I was a postdoc, so five years,
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.620]   and the entire time I was a pre-tenured professor,
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.420]   so five years, so I basically followed
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.640]   the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.420]   which is, you know, people can look it up,
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.940]   but it worked really well.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.180]   It was basically some, you know, like good animal proteins,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.580]   you know, fish and meat and things like that.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.420]   - Why slow carb?
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600]   - Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.460]   is mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables.
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.900]   No dairy, no, anyway.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.020]   But then one day- - Is pasta in there?
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.200]   Sorry to interrupt. - No, no pasta.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.580]   So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb,
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.260]   and I did that and it worked terrifically well
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.300]   just for energy levels,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.420]   'cause I wanna be able to train and work,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.900]   and then one day a week,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.780]   you're supposed to go full cheat day,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.400]   and so I would do what used to be 12 hours,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.220]   but then it became 24, you know,
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.820]   you start to redefine what the day is,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.820]   and I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young,
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.940]   and we would do it together.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.100]   So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.060]   and I would just do the full thing,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.660]   and by the end of the day,
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.020]   you don't wanna look at an item of food.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.540]   You're just repulsed by food.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.900]   The only modification I made was the next day,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.360]   I would fast completely,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.340]   just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.220]   And so I would do them on Sundays,
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.520]   and then Mondays I'd fast all day,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.580]   and then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.740]   But Sunday and Monday,
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.680]   or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.900]   of just blood sugar disaster.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.980]   - Terrible idea or a good idea?
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.180]   - You know, at the time, I enjoyed it.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.300]   I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.420]   What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.740]   now I just try and eat well each day.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.700]   - Protocol. (laughs)
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.540]   - It's really a protocol.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.660]   Now I basically, I do a pseudo-intermittent fasting.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.200]   I'm not really strict, but I'll start eating around 11,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.300]   eat my first meal around 11.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.380]   I usually train in the morning.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.520]   Eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.620]   and I'm not super strict.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.420]   I might have some berries or something late at night.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.140]   - Three meals, two meals?
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.760]   - Two meals, and then maybe a little bit of snacking
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.160]   on some nuts or something in the middle.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   - Ever fast, 24 hours?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.880]   - Never done a long fast,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.920]   except when I was doing the cheat days.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   And actually, there are a couple of different ways
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.800]   to do cheat days that were fun.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.920]   Like if you were in a new city,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.520]   you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.040]   Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.440]   John Romaniello did a,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.760]   I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.360]   you know, marathons 26.3 miles.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.700]   They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.820]   They put it on a map, and I never took it to that extreme,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.380]   but- - Wait, wait, wait.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.500]   Over how many days?
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.820]   - One day, that was their cheat day.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.980]   Just 'cause they were, you know-
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.020]   - Just a little bit of something at each place?
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.420]   I mean, there are things that guys do in their 30s
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.040]   that you just shouldn't do in your 40s.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.580]   I can say that 'cause I'm in my 40s.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.980]   And now I just try and eat well most days.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.220]   And what's interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.140]   I completely lost all appetite for sweets.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.980]   I don't know what happened.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.320]   I still love savory foods, so meat and butter and cheese.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.200]   And I love vegetables too.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.220]   So if you put a donut in front of me
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.280]   or ice cream or something, I just,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.120]   it's almost aversive to me,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.320]   and I don't know what happened.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.200]   I don't know what changed.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.760]   - It's probably a scientific explanation.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.600]   - Sure.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   - It says to do maybe- - Neuron loss, dementia.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   (both laugh)
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   - The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.440]   from your soul.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.800]   What was the most delicious thing?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.600]   Is it croissant, donuts?
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.220]   Is there a thing that-
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.760]   - There's a place in Portland,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   I don't know if it's still open,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.800]   called Little T's Bakery.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.360]   And they have croissants
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.200]   that easily rival the croissants in Paris.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.680]   People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.040]   but it's really the bread in Paris that's amazing.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.480]   We lived there when I was a kid
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.800]   and we did a sabbatical there.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.760]   And there they do the baguette morning bake
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.920]   and afternoon bake.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.240]   And there's nothing like the bread in Paris
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.140]   or the people.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.920]   But if you're in the Pacific Northwest,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.000]   you can find amazing croissants there.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   - What do you do with the croissant?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.280]   What do you do with the bread?
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   Butter or is it just-
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.380]   - I actually used to, I don't eat them anymore.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.760]   I don't have much of an appetite for them
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.840]   even though they're not a sweet food,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.000]   but I'm always putting butter on the croissant.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.380]   Butter on the butter croissant.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.220]   No jam.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.480]   I would never adulterate my croissant.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.360]   - I have to actually be honest about this
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.580]   'cause people talk about steak
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.440]   and they talk about bread with the butter.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.820]   I feel like butter is cheating.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.080]   I feel like you're disrespecting the fundamental food
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.320]   by adding butter.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   'Cause butter, it's like a elite version of ketchup.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.520]   - There we diverge because for me,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.100]   bread is just a vehicle for butter.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.760]   A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   - Oh, so that's just the cracker
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.920]   and the bread is just texture.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.160]   - It's just that people look at you funny
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.240]   if you just eat the butter straight,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   which occasionally I do.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.200]   - I got it.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.880]   - So I put a little piece of bread underneath it,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.240]   not because I'm low carb, strictly low carb,
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.000]   but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.140]   - That's like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.640]   It's interesting, but like Indian non-bread,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.400]   you have the bread.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.440]   I've had a lot of soul searching
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.760]   on which part of Indian brings me so much joy.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.800]   Is it the bread or is it all the sauces
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.680]   that come with the bread?
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.820]   - Well, there we diverge again
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.920]   because for whatever reason, no disrespect to anyone,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   but Indian food doesn't appeal to me.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.320]   - Well, you're a lucky man
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.160]   because the number of calories in that food,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.800]   it sneaks like non-bread.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.120]   I don't know how non-bread is made,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   but I think it's just soaked in oil
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.800]   and it just very intensely,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.360]   like the density of calories is very, very high.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.720]   For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the--
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   - That's good.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.520]   - The main time I'm in Austin,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.940]   I start thinking about barbecue.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.380]   I do love meat.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.260]   My dad's Argentine.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.220]   I mean, I love steak.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.060]   I love meat.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.420]   I mean, Argentina chorizo sausage
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.740]   is an appetizer before you have steak.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.700]   - It's meat on top of meat.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.980]   - And it's not just the men, right?
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.380]   You see women, sometimes very petite women
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.540]   eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.340]   Slowly, they eat very slowly there
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.260]   and they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.860]   And they generally do this sort of one meal per day.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.520]   They do that kind of real flexibly.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   - That's how I think about it
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.920]   'cause I often eat one meal a day,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.200]   especially when I'm traveling.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.920]   It feels like a cheap meal
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.800]   because it gives you a bit of more freedom
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.480]   to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.160]   I did the three-day fast and I ate chicken breast,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.960]   like literally chicken breast with nothing else,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.380]   just grilled, and it was the most delicious piece of meat
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.240]   I've ever eaten.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.440]   The problem is when you fast for three days,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   you really can't pig out.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.280]   You really shouldn't.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.500]   - Well, your stomach will shrink in size already.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.840]   Your gut microbiome is almost completely depleted by fasting.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.680]   A lot of people think,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.780]   "Oh, cleanses and fasts are great for the microbiome."
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.660]   They quash your microbiome.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.660]   However, when you start eating again,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.660]   the microbiome comes back better
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.100]   than it was before your fast.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.000]   - For people who don't know,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.400]   Sergey and Todd are on the call.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.960]   They're kind of pulling stuff up.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.500]   They just pulled up- - There's Phelps.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.020]   - Phelps with, I forget how many calories he's eating,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.860]   10,000?
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.680]   - You know what's interesting?
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.800]   There's some cool physiology around this.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.780]   The reason he needed to eat so much
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.060]   is not that he was burning that many calories
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.320]   in pure movement.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.340]   It's that when you do exercise in water,
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.680]   even if it's warm water,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.520]   the heat transfer in water is greater.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.220]   So you burn far more calories.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.540]   And again, here I'm admittedly lifting that
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.260]   from knowledge that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.100]   But I checked it out and it's absolutely true.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.980]   So if you exercise in water,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.580]   even if it's not really cold water,
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.660]   your caloric needs go way up,
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.260]   which is why you get out of the pool
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.620]   and you're often really hungry.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.020]   - And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.380]   and if you're not a fan,
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.140]   what are you doing with your life?
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.100]   You would probably chuckle at the fact
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.740]   that Andrew just cited his sources,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.860]   even on that statement.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.120]   'Cause you're so good at,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.380]   I don't know how your memory works,
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.380]   but the only person whose memory
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.540]   is better than Joe Rogan's is yours.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.780]   - But my colleagues joke,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.860]   PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.580]   Also in science, as you know,
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   attribution is so baked into what we do.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.540]   And I think that it's interesting
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.860]   'cause now spending a lot of time on social media,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.660]   attribution is not as common.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.960]   But in academia, you learn really early on
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.260]   that if you give a talk about your data
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.340]   and you cite all these amazing sources,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.380]   all it does is make you look better.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.620]   Whereas in social media and elsewhere in the business sector,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.020]   it's almost like citing other people,
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.340]   people feel as if it's gonna take away some of the credit.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.340]   All it does is place you in the company of people
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.500]   that do really nice work.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.060]   So I have, and I have genuine
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.700]   and tremendous respect for Tim.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.980]   He's been about 10 years ahead
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.020]   on a huge number of health-related things and other things,
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.320]   an extremely kind person, very thoughtful person.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.980]   So it's also just a pleasure
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.740]   to shine light on other people.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.900]   Well, I actually, to push back,
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.960]   I know there's a culture of if you write a paper,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.100]   standing on the shoulders of giants is a powerful thing,
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.340]   but there's also a culture of not giving credit
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.320]   to the strongest idea in your paper
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.860]   and instead say it's kind of,
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.860]   or imply that it's original.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.500]   There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.140]   I think people get most competitive in all walks of life,
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.620]   but especially in science,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.700]   when they're, the closer they get
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.020]   in the exact thing they work on.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.060]   And so there's this dance,
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.020]   you know, there's a few researchers
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.180]   in each of the individual little things that you work on.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.980]   If you're studying a particular kind of ant,
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.120]   you know that other asshole
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.580]   that also is studying that particular ant,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.100]   and then you're not going to often give credit
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.700]   for the brilliant ideas that that other researcher is doing.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.900]   And I think one of the things you've discovered
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.300]   and just as part of your nature,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.460]   which is why it's really great
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.500]   that you have an audience
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.820]   and you inspire others to do the same,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.660]   is you celebrate that other ant studier.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.740]   It's great, and everybody wins.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.780]   It raises all boats.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.820]   But that initial instinct to be like,
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.100]   what is it in Borat?
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.820]   Like my neighbor gets a toaster,
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.020]   I get a bigger toaster.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.140]   - Yeah, that mindset to,
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.380]   you know, it's not that I'm not competitive
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.300]   in certain domains,
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.760]   but yeah, I get great pleasure
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.160]   from sharing things that I find.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.940]   And I think that, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.660]   you're as strong as your community,
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.900]   and you can build a wonderful community
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.740]   just by pointing out things that you love.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.860]   Like these are all just loves.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.580]   I see a paper and I love it.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.900]   Only rarely do I think,
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.080]   oh, I wish we had done that.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.300]   I usually think, fantastic,
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.700]   now I can just focus on something else
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.340]   'cause they checked off that box.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.980]   - And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and barbecue.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.660]   I should mention that I got a chance
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.100]   to hang out with Rick Rubin, thanks to you.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.940]   He's a friend of yours and you made the connection.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.140]   That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   He's a truly, truly special human being.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.540]   And there's a lot I could say
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.440]   about why he's a special human being.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.660]   I'd love to learn how you met him.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.360]   But I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.040]   it was so interesting talking to him about music,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   and both on the podcast and privately,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.780]   and just listening to music together.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.060]   Because when you mention a song,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.940]   he does this thing where he like closes his eyes
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.460]   and he finds that song in the album
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.140]   that we're talking about.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.900]   And he steps through the album.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.840]   You could see the brain like stepping
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.220]   through individual songs to find that song in the album.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.140]   And there's that kind of lookup process.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.380]   And then he puts himself mentally in that space of like,
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.820]   okay, this is, you know, whatever the album is.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.520]   And not just the ones he produced,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.940]   but all of these in encyclopedia of music.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.460]   And it's so interesting.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.140]   It also, the thing I really love about him
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.500]   is something like a calmness that radiates from him.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.660]   That it's okay to close your eyes and place yourself
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.660]   in the place where that album was recorded,
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.540]   in the feeling of that album, and like that silence.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.380]   Let's go there.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.620]   Let's go there together.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.700]   It's like Alice in Wonderland, and we'll go there together.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.140]   - You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.980]   - Minus the beard.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.720]   - His beard is epic, right?
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.900]   You can't fake a beard like that, you know?
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.260]   - How'd you guys meet?
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.540]   - Yeah, well, Rick, I'm very blessed
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.940]   to consider a close friend.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.860]   Rick and I got introduced through a common friend
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.300]   during the pandemic,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.660]   and we started doing some FaceTime together
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.980]   and just talking about things related to science and health.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.860]   And I'm not a musician.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.020]   I have no musical ability or talent.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.200]   I have a good ability to memorize lyrics,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.300]   and I love lyrics, and I love poetry.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.740]   So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.420]   that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.820]   And so he would give me stories about musicians,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.140]   and I would talk to him about health.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.020]   And then eventually we formed a friendship
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.340]   where we would talk about any number
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.580]   of different topics in life.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.980]   And then we started spending time together in person
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.100]   when he was in town or nearby.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.300]   And as you now know, you know, Rick,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.520]   in addition to all his incredible accomplishments,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.260]   has an incredible understanding
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.260]   of how to get the brain and body into state, right?
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.100]   And as you pointed out,
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.780]   he's willing to do the things
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.540]   that allow him to help these incredible artists
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.940]   get into the best state to do their craft.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.660]   And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.580]   with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more,
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.860]   he'll do that.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.980]   He has routines to allow himself to get into state.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.180]   And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.660]   as something that, you know, we'd all love
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.140]   to just flip the switch and say,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.640]   we're focused or we're creative,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.960]   but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.740]   in order to do that and to figure out what one needs to do
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.420]   on a regular basis to get into a proper state.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.660]   It's not just gonna come from a cup of coffee,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.660]   you know, a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.620]   It's gonna be those things,
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.700]   but it's also going to be really teaching oneself
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.500]   how to get into proper state.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.140]   - Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.620]   Do you think it's a kind of self-hypnosis?
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.940]   - Yes, I do.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.160]   Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.380]   you're very alert and you're very calm.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.360]   And he has a number of these different practices.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.640]   And so we would talk about those.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.460]   And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.220]   about deep neuroscience.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.740]   In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.900]   who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist,
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.320]   and they've become friendly.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.500]   You know, Rick is one of these people
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.660]   that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.140]   incredibly private person too.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.980]   So, you know, I'm being respectful of that.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.520]   But, and then of course, he's a fan of your podcast.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.040]   And so when I learned that,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.900]   I just made natural sense to introduce you.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.780]   And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.440]   And we talk about you a lot.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.600]   And of course, in a positive light, you know,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.880]   I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.900]   and his willingness to do that
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.400]   has completely transformed my routines around life.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.240]   Like for instance,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.360]   before doing a very long podcast recording,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.880]   the solo ones, which often take me several hours
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.820]   or more, six hours to record,
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.300]   sometimes more, sometimes less.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.440]   I realized that there's a certain brain state
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.340]   associated with that.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.040]   So I have to really limit the kind of interactions I have
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.520]   for the two hours before.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.700]   I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.960]   People think I'm crazy,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.940]   but I live in a neighborhood
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.880]   where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.920]   - Are you saying you're not crazy?
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.920]   - Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.760]   But, you know, getting into state of mind
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.640]   is something that we'd all,
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.840]   just imagine we flip the switch,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.040]   but Rick really convinced me,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.660]   you have to do the work to do the work.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.460]   - Can you maybe linger on that, elucidate a little bit more
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.900]   of your process of how you get in that space?
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.040]   That's really interesting.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.600]   'Cause I have to admit,
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.220]   I do everything last minute before a podcast.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.880]   I don't know, like there's a lot of anxiety
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.460]   because like whatever, if I have to pack,
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.120]   if I have to set up stuff,
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.040]   you were luckily a few minutes,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.500]   you showed up a few minutes later.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.020]   - Which for an academic is right on time.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.260]   - Right on time.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.040]   But the stress is immense.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.920]   And on top of that, you look at like a situation
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.560]   with Rick Rubin, I had to set up microphones
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.760]   in front of him.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.000]   And just that stress, the anxiety.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.320]   - He knows a lot about microphones.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.180]   - What did he say, which I really loved?
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.180]   He's like, "How close do you like the microphone to be?"
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.840]   It's like--
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.120]   - That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.620]   That the details really matter.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.380]   The details really matter right down
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.600]   to your relationship to the microphone, right?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.220]   Distance and whether or not it brings out
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.060]   the timbre in your voice.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.240]   But of course, this is what he does, he produces music.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.860]   - But he also said like, he is the professional.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.320]   He said, "How close do you like it to be?"
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.420]   And he said it with a gentleness
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.820]   where I had like an existential crisis
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.440]   where I don't know.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.120]   He gave me so much like, wow,
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.980]   like he made me feel like an artist.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.040]   Like that the microphone distance
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.340]   is a decision you're supposed to make.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.400]   - Well, I have to say, and this has actually come up
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.420]   in some of our conversations about you.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.940]   I mean, you are an artist.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.140]   And actually Joe Rogan, once I heard him talking
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.260]   about podcasting and the fact that he's always trying
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.180]   to get better at it, you know,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.500]   and he described podcasting at one moment as an art, right?
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.600]   And it is, it's a certain medium of communication
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.420]   and there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working,
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.940]   it really can facilitate the transfer of information.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.220]   When it's not, it doesn't.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.740]   I mean, obviously Joe just being himself
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.820]   has tapped into that cadence that allows,
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.860]   and it's made so many people excited to hear him talk.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.220]   - Well, in his case and in general,
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.880]   I think part of the art is refusing the world
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.120]   as you get a bigger audience, change who you are.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.660]   - There's one quote that I've seen out there
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.380]   where he says, you know, I'm like the,
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.780]   talking about himself, he says, you know,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.540]   "I'm like the fish that got through the net."
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.740]   There's no stage version of me, right?
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.220]   How he is in person is how he is, you know,
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.060]   out in the world.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.460]   And of course there's nuance to his life, right?
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.180]   And his different relationships, of course, but it's true.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.740]   I mean, we've had the, you know,
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.700]   the great fortune of spending time with him
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.860]   out away from the microphones, so to speak.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.140]   Joe is Joe.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.720]   - So can you speak to your, that process?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.700]   You mentioned the walking and the talking to yourself,
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.540]   'cause that's fascinating.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.780]   - Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.100]   First of all, when I was a kid,
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.360]   I had a little bit of a grunting tick.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.220]   When I was five or six,
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.700]   I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.700]   and I would do this grunting tick.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.300]   If I get very tired, I start to do it still.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.820]   We actually know that this is related
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.100]   to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.160]   You've got an accelerator and a brake basically
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.500]   in your neural circuitry.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.220]   And kids with Tourette's and OCD,
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.340]   the brake doesn't work quite as well.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.060]   And so one thing that happens is if I wake up
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.860]   in the morning and I'm, especially if I'm well-rested,
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.100]   well, if I'm not well-rested, I do a hypnosis
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.240]   or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.080]   That works really well.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.780]   But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast,
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.940]   I've already gone through my notes.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.460]   I know what I want to say more or less
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.820]   in a kind of general contour.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.460]   And then I take a walk and I try to,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.560]   so no phone with me, and I try to assess
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.900]   whether or not my energy is too high
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.140]   or too low for podcasting.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.160]   Because when you podcast, as you know,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.920]   you have to punch out a lot of material,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.660]   but then there's times when you really need to slow down
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.600]   and emphasize and articulate.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.700]   And so what I do, this is, I don't,
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.180]   I've never revealed this.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.980]   What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.020]   for about 10 minutes, songs I love,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.480]   while I walk out loud.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.860]   - It calms you and focuses you?
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.700]   What does it do for you?
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.580]   - I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.740]   And it also-
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.100]   - Do you sing or speak them?
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.240]   - I often sing them.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   And unfortunately nobody hears.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.880]   And as I do this, I start to evaluate
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.920]   whether or not I'm straining to get the words out
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.960]   or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.240]   so that I can articulate them.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.820]   So there are days when I have so much energy
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.480]   that I'm trying to speak faster than I should
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.100]   in order to articulate properly.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.380]   There are other days when I'm tired
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.540]   and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.500]   And so what I try and do is assess that
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.260]   and then adjust the transmission, the RPM, so to speak.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.540]   For instance, I can speak very quickly
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.860]   and then I can slow down.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.680]   So I can change the cadence of my voice.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.520]   And when you teach in the classroom,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.920]   you learn as you know, 'cause you're an excellent teacher,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.800]   I've watched your lectures in the classroom.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.500]   As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down,
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.300]   every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.020]   or chalkboard and you start writing, right?
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.260]   It gives you a break.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.220]   And then you turn around and you fire back
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.040]   the kind of machine gun fire of information.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.900]   And then you slow down or you underline something.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.600]   When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.340]   There are no visuals in my podcast.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.740]   and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.020]   at approximately the same rate.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.580]   And then I also do this thing of,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.780]   I put my vision into panoramic vision when I walk,
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.660]   which is very calming.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.040]   And then I actually start to remind myself
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.540]   of the purpose of podcasting.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.460]   This sounds very mission statement-y,
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.460]   but you asked what I do.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.820]   I remind myself first and foremost
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.140]   that what I want to communicate,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.260]   what I want to come through
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.160]   is the beauty and utility of biology.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.980]   And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.380]   publicly now about science things thanks to you,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.020]   because I think- - Love and beauty.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.820]   - Yeah, love and beauty. - Dr. Andrew Humerman.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.780]   - Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.180]   And if you're talking about the Lex Friedman podcast,
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.100]   you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.380]   But I think about the,
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.380]   I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.960]   And then I check my emotional state.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.760]   I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.740]   And certainly if I am,
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.340]   that I'm going to set it aside for the podcast,
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.260]   'cause that's not a place
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.260]   for whatever I might be dealing with.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.460]   I also really start to feel into the parts of the research
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.620]   and the papers I found that I really love,
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.340]   because that's the part of me that I like the most,
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.160]   frankly.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.780]   And on the podcast, if there's a paper,
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.740]   like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me,
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.780]   a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.320]   you know, sauna, but some other things.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.680]   And in researching this,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.460]   I learned so much about these heat shock proteins
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.100]   and the use of sauna in Finland for increasing growth hormone
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.940]   but also for the treatment of mental illness.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.180]   And I realized I fell in love with this literature.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.980]   It's just a beautiful literature.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.020]   These people are true pioneers for doing this work.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.740]   Now everyone's into sauna, but this was 20 years ago.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.820]   The way the experiments were done were amazing
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.100]   with all these Finnish people with thermocouples
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.300]   up their rectum to measure temperature,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.260]   swimming in pools.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.700]   It's hilarious and great.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.620]   And so I start to think about it and I think,
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.660]   you know, I just start to really access my love of the work.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.180]   And then when we finally sit down,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.460]   meaning my producer Rob and I and record,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.220]   I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.740]   Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.140]   I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia,
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.020]   Guinness Book of World Records,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.980]   making my mother drive me places to introduce me to,
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.720]   I had this obsession with trapping animals
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.900]   when I was a kid, meet these people.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.100]   And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660]   in class, just as a little kid.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.700]   So that's basically what it is.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.920]   I just try and access that childlike energy.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.820]   And so I want to be clear.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.140]   The goal is always to make the information interesting,
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.620]   clear and actionable.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.740]   And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.940]   But that's basically the process.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.660]   But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.940]   And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.780]   It's the first time I've ever shared it out loud,
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.980]   but Rick was the one who encouraged me
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.620]   to find a process that works
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.900]   and continue to develop that process
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.580]   and not let anything get near that process.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.660]   People in my personal life know this.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.020]   And when it's time, it's like,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.980]   I don't care what else is going on.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.260]   I'm moving into that brain state.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.620]   - And there's probably a process like that
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.900]   for anything that you do in life that you take seriously.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.120]   So the people that have perfected this is athletes.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.620]   Like if Olympic level athletes,
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.380]   they have to have a process like this.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.740]   - No, and I think Tiger Woods actually
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.300]   was taught self-hypnosis quite young
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.780]   and used self-hypnosis often during his tournaments,
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.420]   sometimes to great success and other times less so.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.220]   - Is there other places in life that you use
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.460]   kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.460]   - Many of the best areas of life
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.220]   are their own form of hypnosis, right?
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.060]   - Sure.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.700]   - You know that you're in hypnosis if, for instance,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.220]   you're in a movie and something happens
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.580]   and you feel the emotional lift
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.860]   without being self-conscious about it.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.420]   - Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.820]   in our house is around meal times to try and set a state
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.020]   that food isn't just something
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.440]   that we just throw down on our throats.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.300]   And I'm fortunate that my partner cooks really well.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.420]   And so I try and give her the space to do that.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.420]   And that's a whole thing of her getting into state.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.260]   And then-
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.220]   - For the cooking, the preparation of all that.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.100]   - I can just see it.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.260]   I just see the way she approaches the whole thing
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.980]   and the pleasure in serving it.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.760]   And I'm an eater, not a cooker.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.660]   But-
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.980]   - Both are important roles.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.540]   You could be a very good eater.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.220]   Like there's something about,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.660]   is there anything better in this world than that feeling,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.560]   especially if it's a family, getting around a table,
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.500]   just the warmth of that.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.900]   I don't know.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   It's like the cold outside of the cruel world
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.860]   cannot touch you in this place that you've returned to.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.460]   And if, I mean-
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.620]   - Did you grow up eating meals as a family?
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.880]   - You just sit down, no television.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.500]   - No, well, I didn't really have television period
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.300]   outside of meals.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.140]   So most of my time was spent,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:53.060]   like a stray cat outdoors, just running around,
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.900]   playing soccer.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.940]   - I imagine you in this like dirt or concrete lot
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.940]   between two very high rise buildings playing soccer
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.500]   in like athletic gear that you only see in Eastern Europe.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.820]   You know how like you come to the States
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.220]   and people wear their athletic gear.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.900]   You go to Europe and you see, maybe it's the soccer culture,
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.260]   but you see athletic gear
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.140]   that you just don't see anywhere else.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.980]   - That's interesting.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.000]   I mean, I grew up pretty poor.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.780]   So first of all, I was always wearing my brother's,
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.580]   who's an older brother, brother's clothes.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.200]   And they were like old,
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.540]   my favorite things were American things
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.940]   that I didn't understand.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.260]   It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.540]   And it was just, that was the gear.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.020]   And it was like too large for me,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.180]   but I thought I was the coolest person ever
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.780]   just wearing this fancy, like Kanye type of fashion.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.620]   - Yeah, there's something about,
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.680]   I feel like in Eastern Europe,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.500]   they wear athletic gear where like the guys
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   like zip up their collars.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.060]   - No, that's like fancy stuff.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.460]   That's if you like, those are the cool kids.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.300]   - I see.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.140]   (laughing)
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.660]   - Like the cool soccer players, football players
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.420]   that like they were in a league of some kind.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.740]   So they would get uniforms or like,
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.180]   or they somehow, I always thought anyone
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.500]   who had anything nice had to do something really bad
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.340]   to get it.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.680]   That was my way, view of the world.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.380]   Because like, I guess I didn't understand
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.380]   how it's possible to be rich.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.300]   'Cause most of us were surrounded by people who are poor
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.780]   and that life was beautiful and simple.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.820]   And it's like, why do you escape that life?
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.980]   But you still admire the cool,
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.800]   like when we got McDonald's, it was like,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.980]   what kind of world does this place come from?
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.940]   Like who invented this?
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.500]   It's a fascinating view from a child's perspective
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.700]   of like of capitalism.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.940]   - Yeah, but the fact that you ate dinner together
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.400]   is really interesting.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.540]   My parents divorced when I was an adolescent.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.580]   So then there was a total fracture of any family structure.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.860]   But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.900]   I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.900]   And it was like a very structured thing.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.540]   I don't know if kids do that now.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.180]   If I ever have kids, they're gonna do that.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.660]   And certainly, actually on the way over here,
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.460]   I was thinking, I was like,
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.720]   I really want a lot of kids.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.340]   I want like a whole litter.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.260]   And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.220]   then we can pit them against each other with jujitsu.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.820]   This is my chance at redemption.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.420]   - It's the law of game.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.140]   - They'll all want to be engineers or physicists.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.800]   They won't want to be biologists.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.380]   But in all seriousness, I look forward to the day
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.380]   that our kids play together.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.500]   - Yeah, I think there's something,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.220]   so the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.260]   but also the special occasion dinners,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.020]   like where there's a little bit more preparation,
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.860]   a little bit more cooking,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.060]   whether it's on the weekend or for some holiday.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.020]   In Russia, it was a thing that actually I find
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.860]   completely missing for the most part.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.940]   In America is there was neighbors.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:11.140]   You broke the walls between families much more commonly.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.860]   Like there would be kind of regular characters,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.940]   like a sitcom almost.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.380]   You know, if you watch a sitcom,
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.620]   it's never just the family.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.060]   There's always like other characters.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.140]   - Just bursting in the door.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.060]   - Bursting in the door.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.140]   - I'm gonna start doing that here,
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:22.980]   just to make you feel at home.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.820]   - Just throw it.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.740]   - Just start showing up at your studio.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.660]   I know where you live.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.540]   - I think people want to respect,
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.740]   like Michael Malice lives next door to me.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.780]   And I think people want to respect each other's privacy
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.620]   or something like that.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.540]   And I think we all get super busy.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:46.100]   It's kind of work to do this dinner together.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.780]   Or if you see it as a thing that needs to be scheduled,
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.180]   it's work, we get busy, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.540]   But if it's part of a ritual or part of the culture,
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.580]   that all of those walls get broken down.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.660]   And then you realize like that's like later looking back,
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.140]   those are the things you miss.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.900]   It's like, that's what life is about.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.380]   Like all the stupid stuff you're doing
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.300]   in terms of career or whatever, all the busy thing,
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.140]   those don't matter.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.300]   What matters is the people.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.540]   - Yeah, in academia,
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.140]   this changed in the last few years, of course.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.860]   But one of the great joys was professors will stop by
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.700]   your office or your lab.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.580]   Nobody set up an appointment.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.500]   There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.420]   a guy named Harvey Cartney,
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.660]   he's a member of the National Academy.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.260]   He's the truly the world's expert
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.740]   in the evolution of vision and evolution of brains generally.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.340]   And he would show up in my lab
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.940]   and he would just start talking to the students in postdocs.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.780]   And I mean, in a pure encyclopedia.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.820]   And then at some point you'd say,
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.100]   "Hey, Harvey, I got to go."
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.700]   And you'd kick him out, right?
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.620]   Or this guy, he's a physicist, David Kleinfeld,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.980]   who's same way.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.100]   Actually, David Kleinfeld is interesting one.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.820]   A student of his went on to create
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.460]   the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.460]   And one of them is David.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.380]   He's a physics professor.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.020]   Now people can look him up.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.380]   And David's one of those guys
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.340]   who just walk into your office.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.420]   He'd just sit down and he'd just start talking to you.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.340]   And so there's a kind of a family feel.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.700]   It's like Cheers or Seinfeld,
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.900]   or one of those shows where somebody just walks in.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.700]   Yeah, I think you and I both share a love
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.980]   of the community around things.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.740]   And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.620]   I should say for the guest episodes,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.340]   the preparation is completely different
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.980]   because it's more conversational.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.580]   And so there, I don't do any of this business
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.260]   of putting myself into state.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.060]   I just try and make sure that the guest is taken care of.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.920]   And I do list out the questions I'm gonna ask before,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.460]   but those, I actually really like the interview episodes
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.940]   far more than I like doing the solo ones.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.180]   - Just psychologically, you mean?
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.540]   - I just like learning from someone directly
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.120]   because you asking an expert about something,
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.700]   like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.620]   where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.500]   and for the first time, and finally,
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.220]   someone was explaining to me the difference
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.180]   between machine learning, artificial intelligence,
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.460]   and all these other things.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.060]   You know, and I've finally forgiven you
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.420]   for making me cry about Costello on camera,
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.340]   'cause it helped me move through it.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.340]   But in all seriousness,
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.580]   the interview ones are a sheer pleasure.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.580]   The solo ones I really enjoy, but they're work.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.660]   Sometimes I think like I'm gonna sweat a little blood
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.100]   prepping for them.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.940]   - Well, it's interesting 'cause I do think
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.180]   prepping for interviews, having a similar process
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.980]   might be also very valuable.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.620]   Like I have to think about that 'cause
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:33.260]   I think when you do a conversation for several hours,
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.020]   especially when it's a high stakes one,
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.740]   so it's not like you and I know,
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.580]   it's more like it's just chatting and so on.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.740]   - The world order isn't gonna shift according to it.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.380]   Although you never know.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.660]   Knowing you, we'll probably be into
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.980]   some pretty controversial topics in a few minutes.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.100]   You like to ride the edge more than I do.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.380]   There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.580]   And my response to those is always that
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.820]   I have a lot of opinions about that, but not a lot to say.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.820]   But whereas you've become far braver
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   in terms of the topics you'll encounter
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.260]   and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:11.140]   Some of them are people that a lot of people don't like.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.820]   And you've been willing to just sit down
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.300]   and maybe it's the jujitsu thing.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.140]   - I don't know, it is tricky.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.900]   One of my goals for this year is to talk to people
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.580]   that a lot of people really don't like.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.260]   - Are you gonna share with us?
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.100]   And here I am.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.860]   (laughing)
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   - But people that are in prison, major political leaders,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.020]   I've been thinking a lot about how to talk
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.340]   to really difficult, controversial figures,
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.220]   but find together something with them
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.700]   that's deeply honest about their nature,
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   about the ideas they have about the world,
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.660]   like reveal something real.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.500]   And some people, you have to be very careful.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.620]   Some people are very good at hiding the real inside them,
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.260]   even from themselves.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.620]   That's something I think about a lot.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.300]   I think about dictators of the past
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.940]   and I put myself in the mindset,
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.700]   well, how do you reveal something real
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.700]   about this person to themselves?
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.660]   I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.660]   but a great conversation is one
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.380]   where both of you discover something new.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.260]   Like it's not just, so I love that too.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.840]   That's my favorite thing, what you mentioned,
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.540]   which is allowing your curiosity
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.700]   and ask all kinds of questions
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.140]   and get excited to learn from an expert,
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.420]   but also to push them to discover something
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.140]   about themselves, about their ideas together.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.580]   And then that discovery, and sometimes it's like,
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:55.420]   we don't see it in the moment, but the audience hears it.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.060]   It's weird to say, like I would compare it
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.060]   to when you're a musician
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.780]   and you're playing with other musicians,
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.020]   you lose yourself in the moment.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.320]   Yeah, it's all, it's like, it's working right.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   It's working, but you don't really see the big picture
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.820]   impact of what it's working right actually feels like.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.380]   And that's where the audience can see that.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.340]   Like if you talk to somebody evil,
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.860]   for me as an interviewer,
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.620]   I have to empathize with that person.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.140]   If I want to understand,
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.780]   I have to put myself in that mind space
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.980]   and to put yourself in that mindset,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.420]   you really have to become that,
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.680]   you have to understand the evil inside of you.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.420]   Like you can't just think if somebody is in power
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.300]   and has used that power to abuse others,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.260]   you can't just be, I personally,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.060]   a person who seeks to understand,
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.020]   you can't just be a journalist asking generic questions.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.940]   You have to put yourself in a place
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.580]   where you're somebody who's given a lot of power
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.420]   and slowly you start to abuse that power.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.420]   And what does that person become?
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.580]   Who are you?
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.260]   I have to plug myself into those moments in my life
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.720]   in the past where I've been angry at something
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.640]   and where I've been cruel because I was angry
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.620]   in little ways, but then you magnify them at scale
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.180]   and I have to go there and that's very human.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.060]   And then I have to look at another person
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.740]   from across the table for me
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.860]   and understand, well, you're there too.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:31.380]   And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.380]   And then where I have to plug myself into places
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.660]   where I've been, I can imagine I can go
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.460]   where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.780]   So I was in a mind space where I was thinking
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.260]   that I'm doing good and I was doing not good.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.380]   Again, I've never gotten the opportunity
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.540]   to do any of those things at a large scale,
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.900]   but all of us have done it at a small scale.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.820]   And I plug myself into that and then we're here.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.540]   We're too, if it's somebody who's in prison,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.460]   if it's somebody who's a dictator,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.060]   we're in that space where evil is,
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.620]   all of us have the capacity to do that evil.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.500]   And I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.940]   And then we're here together in that dark, dark place.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.980]   And then if it's just right,
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.820]   something real can actually come.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.940]   Something from that person's childhood,
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.620]   maybe awakening to a realization
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.820]   that I thought it was a good person and I'm not.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.900]   And that only happens when you truly empathize.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.980]   Those moments of discovery are beautiful,
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.740]   but they also happen in science.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.380]   When you just have a conversation and you realize,
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.020]   I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:48.060]   I feel like we constantly realize beautiful things together.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.220]   - On this element of evil and sociopathy,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   that Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.540]   and that we all have the capacity
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.480]   to be good or evil, et cetera.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.140]   But I have the good fortune of working with somebody
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.700]   who has deep understanding of psychiatry,
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.700]   but also psychoanalysis and Jungian theory.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.020]   And he said to me recently, he said,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.960]   whether or not all people have all things inside them
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.420]   is still debated in the psychology community
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.860]   and in the neuroscience community
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.420]   and as a matter of philosophy.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:28.260]   But there are certain people, not many,
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.980]   but there are certain people
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.180]   for whom they've actually lived out
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.020]   many versions of their possible selves in the first person.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.740]   And so those are unique individuals.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.260]   Then even if they tapped into these things,
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.420]   as you mentioned, at a more minor level,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.980]   as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.420]   So being able to access those different parts of oneself
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.100]   is key and you've been willing to step into that.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.420]   My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.060]   - Yet, yet.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.540]   - You never know, we might do an episode
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.800]   on narcissism and sociopathy.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.900]   The other thing that I took away from a conversation
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.460]   with a friend who did a lot of years in special operations
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.780]   in the intelligence community, he said,
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.220]   "If you look at somebody's past,
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.180]   "at some point you will come to understand
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.300]   "some pretty good reasons
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.500]   "as to why they became who they are.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.660]   "But you have to draw the," his words,
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.340]   "the red line someplace."
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.060]   And what he was referring to was the fact
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.940]   that certain people, at least in the eyes
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.280]   of certain communities, deserve to be eliminated
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.220]   as a consequence of their actions, right?
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.180]   Regardless of what drove them to those actions.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.540]   So it gets right down to the line between nature,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:43.540]   nurture, neuroscience, and the law and justice.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.740]   Complicated, complicated themes.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.060]   - I can think of a number of people
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.260]   that I would love to hear you interview.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.940]   And here I'm not revealing the reasons why,
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.540]   but except for the fact that I think
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.060]   you would be uniquely suited to bring out
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.500]   the important components of the conversation
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.620]   that other people have not been able to do.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.860]   Which, for instance, Liz Holmes.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.540]   This is one of the most mysterious
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   and yet disliked people on the planet.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.660]   She's sort of synonymous with deception.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.180]   I don't know if there've been any real interviews
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.900]   of her since the whole thing.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.900]   I haven't followed that case.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.260]   I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.420]   because it was happening in my hometown, right?
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.980]   Theranos was right up the road.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.260]   The building's still there.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.700]   It's interesting, it's some of the most
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.900]   premier real estate in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.500]   It's sort of like, it's very hard to sell a home
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.060]   where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder,
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.560]   even if it's a beautiful home.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.940]   It's sort of feel like the Theranos building
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.780]   is that building.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.540]   So that would be a really interesting interview.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.580]   I would love to hear that interview.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   - One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.580]   - Yeah, and then there'll even be people that say,
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.740]   you know, was it even science, right?
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.100]   It might've all been deception.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.340]   It might've been one part deception,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.540]   one part goal setting mixed in with.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.580]   Clearly that there were so many factors
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.780]   impacting what happened.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.000]   I think the big difference between Theranos and that story
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.520]   and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.900]   where people promised a lot more than they could deliver
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.720]   is they were promising things that were directly related
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   to health and healthcare.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.960]   People were taking blood tests with the understanding
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.760]   that the data they were getting was important information
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.920]   about sexually transmitted diseases and other diseases
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.480]   and making real world decisions on the basis of that.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.240]   Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.760]   and Steve Jobs was still alive
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.600]   and the phones were dropping calls,
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.940]   if you held it in a particular way,
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.480]   and his response was a little flip.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.920]   He said, "Hey folks, it's a phone."
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.720]   As if like, don't get so worked up.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.860]   But people held him understandably to a very high standard.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.340]   You know, she would sort of, it seemed,
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.360]   and I don't know, 'cause I certainly wasn't there,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.820]   seemed like she sort of adopted this idea
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.360]   that you could get it wrong a bunch of times
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.720]   before you get it right, except if the allegations are true.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.760]   And I think she was found guilty, I believe,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.080]   on a number of counts.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.040]   That a number of the things that they were doing
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.880]   were impacting real world decision-making.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.560]   So Steve's point about the phone, it's just a phone.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.400]   Well, it depends on the call.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.440]   If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.600]   But in the case of blood tests and disease,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.880]   you know, that's serious.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.960]   I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.600]   because of the number of people from major universities
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.400]   and from government that both trusted her
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.360]   and the number of people who did not trust her
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.320]   and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.680]   It was only in the forensic version of it
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.440]   that everyone said, "Oh yeah, I knew that she was lying,"
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.320]   et cetera, et cetera, they were lying.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   There were multiple people involved
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.680]   in those lies, apparently.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.120]   But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.500]   of narcissism, sociopathy,
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.000]   and some of the darker aspects of the mind.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.480]   So yeah, maybe someday.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.880]   Maybe we'll do a podcast together.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.840]   It can be like in the kind of early '90s version
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.360]   of talk shows where we darken the lights
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.660]   and we do it together.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.520]   You can use your voice
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.840]   'cause your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.960]   - Good cop, bad cop.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.440]   Well, it'd be interesting from a scientific perspective
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.640]   of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.200]   how to reveal something real about them.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.480]   I think that requires not just,
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.520]   well, I don't know what that requires.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.920]   That requires the same skill
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.600]   that it takes to be a good therapist.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   - Right, and some therapists won't work with sociopaths
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.440]   because they don't feel any progress can be made.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.400]   Some therapists will work with sociopaths
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.960]   because for the wealthy ones,
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.920]   they often, they want their money.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.380]   I think most therapists are good and benevolent,
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.200]   but there's some that will do it just the same way
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.480]   lawyers will work with criminals
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.120]   knowing they're criminals, right?
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.320]   Oftentimes because they're criminals.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.000]   There are certain domains of psychiatry
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.760]   that are more tractable than others, right?
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.400]   Borderlines are interesting, actually, just to mention
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.840]   because they have this phenomenon of splitting.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.720]   So in the world of psychology,
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.960]   the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.360]   The idea that you could be, you know, feel something
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.080]   and then work a lot to overcome it
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.760]   or have some sort of defense mechanism in place,
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.340]   but that's not destructive.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.320]   That's actually a pretty healthy state to be in
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.380]   provided it's not destructive.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.800]   Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.000]   And the idea is that borderlines split,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.340]   intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.180]   That's why it was called,
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.840]   there's beautiful work by Melanie Klein that describes this,
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.960]   which I'm just now kind of delving into.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.000]   But, you know, so the borderline is the person who is like,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.520]   I love you, I love you, I love you.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.720]   And then truly feels as if they hate you
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.320]   and you become the bad object.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.600]   Borderlines are challenging for psychologists
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.480]   because of the splitting, right?
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.760]   Schizophrenics are challenging
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.920]   because of the detachment from reality.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.120]   And narcissists are challenging
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.640]   because they're often so charming
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.080]   that even the therapists are charmed.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.280]   - I believe you mentioned Karl Deisseroth.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.120]   We'll talk about him.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.480]   - He was definitely not a narcissist.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.400]   He's one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.880]   - Thanks again to you.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.420]   You've connected us.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.840]   I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.920]   You had a conversation with him.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.680]   I really enjoyed it on the podcast.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.760]   You guys come from the same science, from the same place,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.480]   maybe different journeys, fascinating journeys.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.360]   - Well, and levels.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.960]   We were postdocs together.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.880]   Karl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky,
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   five children, amazing marriage to also an amazing scientist.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.040]   His wife, Michelle Monge is in our neurology department
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.680]   at Stanford, incredible thinker, writer,
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.540]   very kind person, humble.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.720]   Speaking of getting into state,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.280]   sorry, Karl, I'm gonna out you on this,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.320]   but Karl, despite being at the highest levels
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.380]   of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist,
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.160]   his office is literally a coat closet
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.880]   with a small table lamp.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.200]   When you meet with Karl, if you manage to meet with him,
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.240]   'cause he's very hard to get to,
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.560]   you walk in, you sit down as if you're going
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.040]   through some interrogation and some spy novel,
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   and he'll ask you, "What are you most excited about lately?"
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.960]   And I've got 11 minutes or something.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.000]   And that's a meeting with Karl 'cause he's that busy,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.280]   but he doesn't have the office with the pictures of the kids
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.760]   and the thing and all that.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.500]   All that is kept elsewhere.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.300]   So in order to get, I asked him,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.980]   "Why do you work in this office?"
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.040]   You work on light and channels of light,
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.780]   things related to light of all things.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.700]   Here you are in this dark room.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.860]   And he said, "Well, this is what gets me
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.260]   "into the state of mind to be able to do what I wanna do."
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.860]   Very Rick Rubin-ish, not at all the same person,
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.600]   but very similar in that he's figured out
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.380]   the physical space he needs in order to get
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.020]   into the optimal state to do the work
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.460]   that he needs to do in this lifetime.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.460]   And it's very unusual.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.340]   If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.540]   I can do it here for a while.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.960]   We're in this black cube here, floating in space, of course.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.880]   But I find that amazing that these people
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.820]   that are operating at this super high level
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.560]   are willing to actually deprive themselves
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.040]   of a lot of conditions.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.580]   They're not sitting there with the secretary coming in,
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.080]   offering them espresso every five minutes and things like,
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.920]   no, no, no, that's New York neuroscience.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.000]   The New York neuroscience mafia is kind of famous
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.160]   for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that,
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.180]   and they enjoy lifestyle a lot.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.460]   The New York neuroscience mafia.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.300]   - Oh, there is one.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.120]   There definitely is one.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.380]   They know who they are.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.220]   They know who they are.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.960]   - For people who don't know,
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.940]   Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.420]   and now he's just starting wars
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.620]   with the neuroscience mafia.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.660]   - Well, they do amazing science.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.780]   They think, they love their lifestyle,
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.380]   and that's wonderful, but the culture is very different.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.540]   Carl, and I think Silicon Valley in general,
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:55.540]   kind of prides itself on this kind of monk-like asceticism.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.820]   - But at the individual scale,
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.700]   be deliberate about controlling the environment.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.900]   I think about that with the conversations too.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.180]   I haven't been deliberate about that either
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.500]   in terms of controlling the space you're in.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.700]   Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.860]   - There is nothing like the Lex Friedman podcast studio.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.180]   First of all, when you do them remotely,
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.620]   I always feel like I'm in a witness relocation program.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.140]   You only get the coordinates at the last moment,
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.420]   and you always get the sense
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.180]   that there are people behind the walls
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.140]   that are recording things.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.620]   - Well, there's something about creating a feeling.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.460]   I have a sense that there's a robot over there,
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.700]   there's several throughout this place,
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.500]   and I think part of that,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.620]   part of creating a feeling would be
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.620]   having the robots constantly moving around
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.960]   and having a mind of their own,
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.660]   because that would most closely put guests
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.700]   and other humans that they interact with
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.460]   into a place that's closest to my mind,
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.940]   because it's such an engineering mind,
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.500]   and one where when things come to life,
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.460]   it's a beautiful place to be.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.700]   And whatever that is, that could be art,
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.780]   but to me, robots are art.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.780]   And so I'm thinking about that both for me and for guests.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.900]   And I'm also thinking about the difficult guests,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.540]   just to return to, you said Elizabeth Holmes,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:26.220]   the one person, maybe a couple of things I wanna say.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.980]   So one person I think I would like to talk to
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.300]   is Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.380]   - I always get afraid right before you reveal
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.020]   these kinds of things, and now I know why I get afraid.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:42.220]   Yeah, I mean, again, assuming that she did the things
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.900]   that people claim she did, they're despicable, right?
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.020]   I mean, these were underage children, right?
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.480]   There's just no version of the story
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.580]   where she did the things she was accused of doing
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   and is still a quote unquote good person.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.380]   There's just, in my mind, right?
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.780]   And yet I think there is tremendous interest
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:06.340]   in understanding what led her to do all that,
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.180]   at least for some people.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.180]   - Let me say a couple of things.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   So one is at a high level, let me say that she believes,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:18.900]   or her current story is, is that she's the victim.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.980]   - Of who?
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.020]   - Of Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:21.860]   - Oh my.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.780]   - I think I'll just leave that there as is.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.920]   So these are ideas that you're facing.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.700]   The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.900]   is what it is, and this is, imagine, folks,
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.080]   if you went into a room with a person that says that,
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.240]   what do you do next?
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   Let me also say that I never, or rarely,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.480]   let me say not say never, I rarely mention names
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.200]   that I'm interested in talking to
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.840]   without having made significant progress
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.140]   in already securing that interview.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:07.600]   So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.660]   and Vladimir Putin.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.160]   I do not bring them up lightly in terms of,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.200]   in terms of there being a path to an actual conversation.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   That said, something I regret, but I'm not sure I know
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.800]   what to do with it, but in the case of all the people
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.720]   I just mentioned, I haven't been preparing
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.520]   for those conversations.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:35.520]   I only start really preparing seriously when it's confirmed
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.320]   because it's such a heavy burden.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.280]   And one of the things I regret in having mentioned
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.240]   a conversation with Vladimir Putin
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:51.200]   before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.760]   is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually,
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   and without having really deeply put myself into a place
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.080]   that I'm ready to talk to him.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.460]   And that's a tricky thing because then the internet,
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.640]   the audience in general, and just me,
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.360]   when I listen back to my dumb self,
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.280]   think, well, why are you speaking so lightly
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.760]   about these topics?
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.520]   - Well, I know you've had a longstanding interest
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.600]   in talking to him.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   I think now, you know, well, I don't understand
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:31.200]   how I would sit down and have a conversation
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.560]   with somebody like that, but that's not in the range
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.400]   of my skillsets, right?
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.960]   Or like maybe not in the range of things
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.000]   that you're drawn to somehow.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.840]   - Not so much.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.260]   I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.720]   Well, you did an episode recently with this guy
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.960]   who was a former cyber criminal turned stateside, right?
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.240]   I think he works for the government now.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.200]   And there was a segment in there, remind me his name?
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.720]   - Brett Johnson. - Brett Johnson.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.320]   There was a segment in there where he talked
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:06.120]   about stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.200]   from some elderly woman, and this was everything she had.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse,
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.560]   which is the way he described it is purely sociopathic.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.680]   And then of course we learned that he grew up in a family
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.160]   where criminal behavior was very common.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.840]   It was kind of embedded into his notions
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.680]   of what typical behaviors were.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.600]   And I found myself somewhat conflicted,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.560]   but also hung up on this idea that, you know,
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.480]   I mean, he had behaved as a sociopath
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.960]   or in a sociopathic way.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.600]   And it created an internal conflict
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.020]   because he's quite charming guest
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.860]   and his stories are terrific.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.200]   Especially I really enjoyed his discussions
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.720]   about how he would go out and do all these things
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.160]   out of a desire to please his girlfriend.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.280]   You know, so he was in service to other people
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.360]   despite being a sociopath.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.760]   He could say he was in service to them as a way to extract.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.240]   It gets very complicated.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.120]   I think is the reason I went into science
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.320]   is that at some level,
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.480]   it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.080]   And I don't know that I have the ability
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.080]   to suspend judgment over the,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.560]   away from the kind of top level contours
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.460]   of my initial reaction to like,
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.400]   if it's true, like the Galeen Maxwell's
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.320]   and the Liz Holmes and the other sociopaths
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.240]   is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.720]   But that could also reflect the fact that I'm not as,
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.640]   you know, neurologically sophisticated
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.640]   as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.120]   forgiveness, but also holding people accountable
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:44.960]   at the same time.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.780]   That's work.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.840]   That takes, if you think about it,
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.360]   that's three, four brain circuits
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.700]   having to work in parallel.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.720]   That's the difference between chess or a game of Go
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.560]   and a game of checkers.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.000]   I guess I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.480]   - No, so one is actually holding in your mind
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.160]   and two is the raw skill of conversation.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.000]   You're very, just having listened to your interviews,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.640]   you're very good at conversation.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.960]   But the skill of conversation is really tricky.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.280]   I'm not being self-deprecating.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.040]   I'm being just objective.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.560]   I'm not good at conversation.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.760]   I'm working very hard at getting better at it.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.840]   I'm speaking not about just podcasting.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.020]   I'm speaking just normal life.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.000]   I have anxiety from social interaction.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.800]   - Do you really?
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.040]   - A huge amount, yeah.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.880]   - So this is interesting
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   because I never detect that in you, ever.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.640]   And I think there are people that we both know
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.200]   that have said to me that they too feel anxious
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.520]   and yet your voice is steady.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.480]   I don't see any perspiration.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:55.360]   You appear incredibly calm.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.520]   - I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.960]   - Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him,
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.280]   is intimidatingly calm.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.560]   But as you get to know him a bit,
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.300]   you realize that the kindness and the generosity
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.740]   that you sense is real.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.640]   But yeah, I would never in a million years
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.720]   have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.080]   - Can I just make another quick comment?
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.360]   This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.240]   Maybe you've already gotten the same.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.320]   But having mentioned Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky,
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:37.140]   Galee Maxwell, there's a natural question.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:42.940]   How does Lex have access to these people?
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.240]   Who does he work for?
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   Like how does he--
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.840]   - Or who works for him.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.080]   - Who works for him.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.820]   What does he have on others?
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.800]   I ask myself, when I look in the mirror,
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.000]   just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.800]   I wanna ask the same question.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.720]   Well, I usually ask in the following way,
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.320]   how the fuck am I so lucky?
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.720]   Am I a robot being controlled by somebody else?
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.340]   How is this my life right now?
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.180]   What is happening?
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.760]   It really does feel like a simulation.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.040]   So let me just speak to several things.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.280]   First of all, I have no boss.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.160]   I know of nor am I controlled
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.440]   by any intelligence agencies of any nation.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.040]   - We're gonna get you a dog, Lex.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.920]   - So that I can talk to.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.320]   I'm scared of getting a dog 'cause I would fall in love
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.560]   so deeply, I think, that--
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.680]   - Next time I'm bringing a puppy.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.880]   I'm just gonna bring a puppy and I'm gonna leave it here.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.520]   - And then you'll never see me again.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.440]   I mean, I love dogs so much.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.400]   I was also surprised and maybe,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.520]   I have never talked to an intelligence agency,
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.160]   which is very interesting to me.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.060]   - That you're aware of.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.240]   'Cause they're very good at communicating with people.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.960]   - But I've been very suspicious on this exact point.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.520]   That's the downside of kind of being an introvert,
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.440]   having anxiety about social interaction,
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.200]   but then having so much love thrown your way
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.880]   because connect over podcast.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.560]   Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.200]   So people come with you with love that I really love,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.360]   I appreciate, but I wonder exactly this question.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.400]   Why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.200]   and showing me so much love?
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.120]   - Well, because, sorry to interrupt you again,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.820]   but it's what we do.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.360]   And it's a sign of interest, by the way.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.040]   Sometimes, yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.240]   and she said, "Interruption, 75% of the time
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.700]   "is a sign of real interest in what the person is saying,
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.560]   "if nothing else."
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.180]   Well, you're very lovable.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.520]   I mean, I learned about Hedgehog in the Fog from you.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.000]   When I learned, you're very lovable.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.760]   People love you because you're lovable.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.480]   - I love love, okay, so 100%.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.800]   And I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas,
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.080]   people are so amazing.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.800]   I go just hugs and just, I love people.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   - Do you want a family?
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.280]   Are you eventually? - 100%.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.240]   No, I mean, I take what you said as a challenge
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.900]   in terms of having a family with kids
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.280]   and they do jujitsu and obviously defeat you
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   and make you miserable for your failures as a father
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.280]   because you couldn't--
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.960]   - But you're gonna be a great dad.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.120]   - Build up an army of good jujitsu people.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.880]   But yes, I would love a family.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.120]   I would love to have children.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.600]   But I just wanna finish that point
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   'cause I'm nervous about it.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.800]   I'm nervous about the way people perceive,
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.960]   what you're seeing is a Forrest Gump type character.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.120]   Like who I am, I seem to be,
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.720]   and this is how the world seems to work,
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.440]   is you just try to be yourself,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.560]   like you try to find yourself,
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.240]   that's maybe the better way to say it,
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.400]   and just be that.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.640]   Be kind to people.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.640]   Work your ass off and say F you to anybody
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.480]   that wants to control you or to tell you what to do.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.520]   Just be free and then put love out there in the world
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.400]   and doors open.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.700]   This karma thing seems to work.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:32.840]   How the hell, my friends as you know,
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.640]   how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.080]   with Rick Rubin, right?
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.000]   Like doors-- - You guys had barbecue.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.160]   - He had barbecue.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.480]   Right, of course I had barbecue.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.320]   He's from New York.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.880]   Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.280]   'cause bad restaurants don't last long in New York.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.360]   - And barbecue counts as-- - Oh yeah.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.840]   - Oh yeah, Texas barbecue.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.120]   - Well, I would also add that whether or not
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.440]   you realize or not, you took tremendous risk.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.200]   I mean, we come from the same original community,
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.180]   which is academic science, right?
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:07.600]   And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.400]   is risky, right?
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.680]   To, you know, I was third or fourth man in
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.640]   in terms of podcasting as an academic
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.000]   'cause you had gone on Brogan many times,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.680]   David Sinclair had gone on there.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.560]   Especially before the pandemic,
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.960]   you just didn't see many academics and scientists talking
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.880]   in a public facing way.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.040]   So you took tremendous risk, right?
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.180]   You took tremendous risk,
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.400]   always wearing that jacket and tie, right?
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.040]   The only time I haven't seen you in that truly
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.820]   is when we rolled jujitsu, which is,
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.200]   and I hear I'm being generous to myself
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.320]   saying I rolled jujitsu,
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.200]   basically you choked me out in front of hundreds of,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.040]   - That was really risky.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.800]   - It was great fun and I--
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.720]   - Thank you for doing that.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.520]   To have a beginner's mind is a beautiful thing.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.280]   - Well, I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.300]   but I'm going to, I truly am.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:56.660]   Especially there's a small chance I might find myself
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.480]   in Austin a bit more often in the near future.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.440]   But the--
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.640]   - Well, if you're out in San Francisco,
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.920]   you should train with Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.120]   He just started, so.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.000]   - Oh yeah?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.480]   - You guys could-- - Interesting.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.960]   (laughing)
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.800]   - Sure.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.120]   - I mean, he's actually,
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.400]   so many people listen to an episode,
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.120]   perhaps he's a fascinating human being too.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.820]   - I listened to it, it was great.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.740]   You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:24.120]   So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.300]   'cause you can die, you can crash your career,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.840]   you can do all sorts of self-destructive
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.200]   or destructive things when taking risks.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.560]   You took risks and they paid off, right?
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.200]   And you take different risks at different stages,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.960]   but I don't throw around the word admiration lightly.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.560]   I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom at MIT,
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.480]   like I'm gonna film this and put it online.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.040]   One of your early interviews is with Ido Portal,
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.120]   who's very hard to get to.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.880]   I've communicated with Ido a few times.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.760]   - You should definitely talk to him.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.200]   - I can't wait to talk to him, I'm dying to talk to him.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.480]   I was supposed to do some course teaching with him
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.760]   right before the pandemic hit,
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.720]   and then it got canceled 'cause he couldn't travel.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.000]   But getting to him is exceedingly challenging.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.360]   So you do have this incredible ability to get to people
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.880]   and for them to trust you and know you.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.360]   And I think it's through your authenticity.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.080]   And I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.800]   where people haven't been before.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.560]   You know, this is, what's the saying about pioneers?
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.860]   How do you spot the pioneers?
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.040]   They're the people with the arrows in their backs.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.280]   You know, so that's the, you know, yeah.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.200]   And that's actually a quote that I lifted
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.080]   from Terry Signalsky, who's a-
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.920]   - There you go.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.040]   Exciting sources again.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.320]   - Terry's, you should talk to Terry.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.560]   He's a computational neuroscientist
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.440]   down at the Salk Institute,
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.760]   Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.400]   But so, you know, taking risks
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.280]   that other people have not taken is, that's a real thing.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.160]   And to do it with integrity and rigor, that's a real thing.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.960]   and I hope it lands and lands deeply.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.400]   But I also hope that people will hear that
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.680]   and understand that it's one thing
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.400]   to do what other people are already doing boldly.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.540]   It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.860]   or venue, and you did that.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.560]   And you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.560]   but you didn't go write a book.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.440]   A lot of academics have written books.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.960]   You went online.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.040]   Jordan Peterson, another controversial character,
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.400]   he did it too, all those lectures that he filmed.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.060]   And then it's led to this other thing.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.180]   So, you know, there's karma,
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.780]   and then there's also having the spine
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.380]   to just put it all on the line and do something
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:40.380]   for which there is no prior example to hold onto
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.020]   while you go through those headwinds.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.140]   - The really fascinating thing,
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.500]   and actually a lot of people tell me about you,
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   Andrew Kuberman, like the reach of a podcast
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.020]   is really fascinating.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.100]   It's not the numbers of people that listen.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.620]   I don't know if that's important at all.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:02.420]   What's important is the depth of connection
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.180]   you have with certain people.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.220]   It really moves them.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.520]   And they really get you.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.180]   So there's a lot of big Andrew Kuberman fans
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.600]   that really get you.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.900]   It's not just the science.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.840]   It's the stuff between the lines.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.860]   It's Costello.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.940]   It's the whole picture of a scientist
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:22.060]   that finds beauty in biology and reveals it.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.300]   And they love you for it.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:28.220]   You know, because it was on television at the time,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.700]   I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.260]   And I don't watch television,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.740]   but whenever I would travel,
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.140]   if there was a TV in the airplane,
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.380]   I would find myself getting wrapped into things
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.840]   like locked up abroad.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.140]   And these things where they,
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.140]   which make you terrified to travel anywhere,
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.840]   let alone commit a crime overseas.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.580]   The scenes of some of these prisons are so dramatic.
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.500]   And, you know, I mean, her case got a ton of interest.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.620]   And then, you know, she went and then was a student
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.220]   at the University of Washington
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.660]   and has talked quite openly about, you know,
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.620]   how she was treated and how people assume guilt.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.140]   And, you know, and eventually, you know,
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.940]   she was exonerated and, you know,
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.440]   we can only go by what we know, what the law determined.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.240]   But, you know, these are people
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.540]   that the world is fascinated by.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.540]   I would, I'm guessing about a third of people
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.220]   have already decided this person is despicable.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.440]   Why would you ever give them an audience?
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.140]   About a third of people I think are open to,
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.100]   or at least interested in learning more about them.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.140]   And then I think the remaining third,
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.960]   kind of the third that,
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.820]   the category that I put myself in,
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   which is what can I learn about people and myself,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.080]   even in my revulsion, right?
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.540]   What can I learn? - About myself.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.180]   - Yeah, what can I learn about myself
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.180]   from listening to this conversation with somebody
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.300]   that I like to think, I'm not talking about Amanda here,
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.140]   I'm talking about the other people
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.400]   that you're talking about, that I don't,
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.940]   I can't relate to, right?
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:57.300]   Talking, hearing conversations with and about people
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.740]   that you cannot relate to is informative.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.680]   Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular, right?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.220]   - Well, there's an interesting thing I also had to,
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.620]   ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:12.060]   one of the questions I was asking myself,
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.180]   and this is not to be dramatic,
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.740]   it's just a very simple, honest question,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.180]   that I think a lot of journalists
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.060]   that operate in the war zone,
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.780]   or documentary filmmakers
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.740]   that I've recently got a chance to meet,
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.320]   have to be honest with themselves.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   Are you willing to put at risk your life for things you do?
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.020]   - What are you willing to die for?
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.460]   - Yeah, what are you willing to die for?
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.780]   It sounds very dramatic.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.920]   But whenever risk goes up,
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.060]   I mean, I don't know, you asked that
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.740]   if you wanna take a trip out to space
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.300]   on a commercial space flight.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.220]   Do you have to, are you willing to die for this journey?
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.020]   Now, the odds there are really small.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.180]   - I just watched Apollo 13 again.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.300]   Great movie. - Yeah, great movie.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.580]   - I'm not going to space.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.260]   (laughing)
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.700]   I'm not going to space.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.580]   - Afraid of heights?
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.860]   - No, I'm not afraid of heights.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.120]   It feels like a terrible place to die.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.960]   - Yeah.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.040]   Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.540]   - Yeah, although, I have a song teed up in my phone.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.260]   If the plane starts to go down,
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.560]   I'm gonna spend the last few.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.020]   It's a rare song, nobody knows it.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.800]   It's a song off a beat track of my favorite band,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.060]   which is Rancid, it's called "The Sentence."
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.060]   And nobody, and I love it,
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.340]   and I listen to it almost every day.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.220]   - Rancid, "The Sentence," it's called "The Sentence."
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.660]   - The band is called Rancid, they're a famous band.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rancid. - Relatively.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.260]   Love those guys, love their music.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.740]   And the song is "The Sentence."
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.940]   You can only find it on a B-side or outtake.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.940]   And if you don't know how to decipher Tim Armstrong's voice,
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.500]   then you probably won't understand the lyrics,
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.380]   but because it's sung very, very fast.
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.420]   But if the plane ever goes, anytime there's turbulence,
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.060]   I put that thing in, I put the headphones in,
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.100]   I'm like, well, if it's time, it's time.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.380]   I'm gonna go out like this.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.200]   I don't want to drift off into the galaxy,
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.460]   just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.080]   That sounds horrible.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.580]   Just like I wouldn't want to drown or burn.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.880]   - But on a plane is okay?
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.720]   - Well, on a plane, I mean,
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.200]   like if the thing starts going down
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.160]   and there's truly nothing you can do,
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.240]   you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.200]   - Yeah, true, true.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.040]   I'll probably go with the Pixies' "Where's My Mind?"
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.560]   like from Fight Club.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.640]   And just the calmness, just sit back,
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.400]   like the musicians playing at the Titanic.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.480]   - I didn't know you were a Pixies fan.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.320]   I'm gonna have to--
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.800]   - Not so much a Pixies fan.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.700]   Actually, I should say that I just,
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.840]   that was the "Where's My Mind?"
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.400]   It was the chosen song for Fight Club
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.760]   at the end when the buildings are coming down
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.960]   or something like that.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.880]   So there's certain songs that just fit just right
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.200]   for the collapse of human civilization.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.200]   And you're calmly appreciating like that's just it.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.120]   This is how absurd this life is.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.800]   At any moment, it can end and this is it.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.640]   This is--
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.520]   - I love how we both have "Death and Demise" soundtracks.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.000]   - It's just a question,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.520]   when you're an academic, doesn't come up often.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.920]   - Right, well-- - That's all.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.880]   - Yeah, there are some academics that are bold and brave.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.920]   It's not a phenotype.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.680]   Being bold and brave in the physical world
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.040]   is not a common phenotype of academics.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.240]   I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.720]   I don't have many heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.280]   I mean, people think of him as a writer,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.120]   but he was foremost a neurologist
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.640]   and he took tremendous pushback from the neurology community
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.000]   for doing his books and his articles.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.920]   He has a great biography called "On the Move."
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.080]   There's a wonderful documentary
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.000]   that just came out about him.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.640]   He died in 2015.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.200]   I'm actually kind of a collector of his things,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.400]   but he had tremendous,
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.880]   but he was accused of horrible things
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.280]   until the movie "Awakenings" came out
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.000]   with De Niro and Robin Williams.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.240]   - Amazing movie, by the way.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.760]   People don't, they seem to not say great things
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.600]   about the movie.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.440]   I love that movie.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.280]   - It was amazing.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.440]   And it was only once he became famous from that movie
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.280]   that his more academic work started
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.960]   to receive any kind of attention.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.400]   And he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.160]   You know, the New York neuroscience mafia is a real thing.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.160]   And yes, you know who you are.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.600]   And some of them are actually coming on the podcast.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.440]   They are-
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.920]   - You know, I think we talked offline about this.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.080]   We should start a mafia to fight off
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.640]   whatever's going on in the East Coast.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.000]   Although I'm still at MIT, so I don't know how that works,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.040]   but Boston is different than New York.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.440]   - Yeah, so I have tremendous respect
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.760]   for science done in New York.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.600]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.200]   They are excellent scientists.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.480]   It's just a very different culture than on the West Coast.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.040]   And the personalities-
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.880]   - Tremendous respect for the mob.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.700]   - Well, and the personalities are a bit more grandiose.
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.240]   However, because of some of the shift
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.320]   in science culture in the last few years,
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.580]   things around scandals and things of that sort,
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.160]   they've been forced to tamp down some of their personality
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.400]   or at least their outspoken personality.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.160]   And I actually think it's revealed something
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.560]   really important and useful in science, which is,
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.240]   you know, it used to be the case
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.440]   you could really inject your personality into what you do.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.960]   You know, Richard Feynman's a good example.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.120]   If he did today what he did then,
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.700]   bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech naked,
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.680]   working out theorems in strip clubs and things like that,
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.520]   he would have lost his job in moments, right?
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.740]   So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore.
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.480]   It's actually punished.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.560]   And I'm only half kidding
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.280]   about this New York neuroscience mafia,
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.160]   but because I now exist in multiple realms,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.200]   I can say these sorts of things.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.320]   And I, again, admiration and respect,
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.440]   but I will say that I think it's important
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.400]   that people in science and kids that are curious
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.080]   about science understand that you can have any personality
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.220]   provided that you're ethical and respectful in science
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.040]   and do well, right?
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.520]   There are true bench scientists
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.060]   that just want to be at the bench.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.580]   There are people that just want to be in their office.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.520]   There are people that really enjoy public speaking.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.960]   And there are people that love meetings
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.360]   and there are people that hate crowds.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.160]   And so there's a place for everybody,
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.020]   truly a place for everybody in science.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.280]   I would like to be able to shine light
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.200]   on the fact that there are,
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.560]   you can have a shy personality, an outgoing personality,
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.760]   and you can, all of those can be,
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.400]   have excellent careers in science,
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.140]   but you have to find the community in place
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:34.980]   that's right for you.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.680]   One reason I like Stanford is that Stanford
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.620]   is very much about the future.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.960]   We have Nobel prize winners,
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.020]   we have field medal winners and all that stuff,
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.240]   and their names are on walls
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.080]   and we acknowledge their great works.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.040]   But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.400]   is about what's happening now and what could happen next.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.960]   It's really about the future.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.920]   Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.320]   not to be named, you hear that,
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.800]   but there's a lot of kind of recycling
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.600]   and regurgitation of how wonderful people are
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.800]   based on things they did previously.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.240]   And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.940]   sure, they have respect for Nobel prizes,
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.120]   they're delighted to be learning from
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   and surrounded by all these great minds,
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.600]   but they're mostly interested in what they're gonna create.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.960]   And so I kind of, not kind of,
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.240]   I really like the shift toward possibility
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.400]   as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.640]   You know, I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.540]   I'm sure it's a wonderful experience.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.120]   I'm also not sure what purpose it serves for the world,
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.240]   but I've never been,
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.720]   and so I don't know what the conversations are,
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.920]   and so maybe I'm, you know, speaking out of line here.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.040]   And now I'm definitely not getting invited.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.840]   - No, you're definitely getting invited.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.760]   But yeah, I'm with you.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.160]   The culture's picked the right ones for you.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.880]   That's why I like MIT, the spirit of it.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.140]   To me, it's not about the past or the future.
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.160]   It's about just tinkering and having fun,
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.480]   building cool stuff.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.520]   Like the big ambitious projects, it's there.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.640]   I mean, maybe more in the biology and the health side,
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.720]   but like the engineering side,
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.760]   it doesn't matter if this has any impact.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   Let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.600]   - Well, there, whenever I'm in Kendall Square,
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.760]   I've seen, they have those buildings there
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.360]   that actually tilt toward the ground.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.480]   These are these, the architecture of MIT
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.080]   is also really impressive.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.480]   - Yeah, this, he pulled up,
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.360]   Sergey just pulled up Elon Musk's tweet.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.800]   I'm inspired by curiosity.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.200]   That is what drives me.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.000]   So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.720]   so that we may aspire to understand the universe.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.800]   Those are like three tweets in one, but curiosity, yeah,
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.720]   curiosity for its own sake.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.760]   - What's that saying?
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.340]   I think Dorothy Parker said,
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:48.560]   "The cure for boredom is curiosity.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.480]   "There's no cure for curiosity."
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.600]   - And you need to celebrate.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.920]   So let me just briefly mention
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.600]   to my lovely friends at MIT
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.200]   to celebrate different weirdness,
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.840]   to celebrate the weird characters.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.800]   I sometimes get loving pressure
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.040]   from my lovely friends at MIT
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.600]   to tone down the weirdness a bit.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.440]   - Really?
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.460]   Even from MIT?
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:25.000]   - I'm very fortunate to have a lot of leverage
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.160]   to where I have completely resist the pressure,
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.520]   but I'm very sure that there's young faculty
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.920]   that with that subtle pressure would--
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.880]   - Dissolve them into a puddle of tears.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.720]   - Not, no, no.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.560]   - Are they from Boston?
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.880]   Excuse me. - From Boston, that's right.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.720]   - They're tougher than that.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.800]   - That's right, but it's a slight nudging
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.280]   towards conformity that I think ultimately destroys
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   or at least lessens the power of the kind of science
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.240]   that you can do when you encourage diversity,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.440]   diversity in all of its forms,
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.200]   including the weirdness of ideas,
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.840]   the out-of-the-box thinkers,
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.860]   including the flamboyant behavior online,
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.680]   how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.260]   You know, people talk about freedom of speech,
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.800]   but it's not just like freedom of speech
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.320]   to say controversial things.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.560]   It's also freedom of speech to be weird.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.940]   Like if you're for some reason fascinated in,
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.640]   like you look at Elon Musk, he talks about sex a lot.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.080]   Let the guy put sex memes up, who cares?
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.360]   - I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.400]   whatever he wants.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.640]   - Right, there's no pressure,
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.360]   but there's a bunch of Elons in the academic world,
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.520]   there's a bunch of Elo--
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.720]   No, actually, sorry, let me backtrack
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.080]   'cause the man deserves props.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.400]   - Right, he's unparalleled.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.480]   He's a CEO of major companies.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.240]   You better believe there's pressure
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.640]   to behave more like a CEO as opposed to a giggling schoolboy
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.120]   who's posting memes throughout the night.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.060]   But that is him.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:06.080]   And that freedom, that's what freedom looks like.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.080]   I talked to a lot of CEOs,
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.080]   and a lot of them feel like caged birds
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.720]   who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.720]   Like there's like shareholders,
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.640]   and they come up with excuses for themselves.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   Here's why I have to be this way, you have to understand.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.840]   So on, there's PR, there's marketing people,
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.280]   there's lawyers, there's all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:35.080]   But the final result is the authenticity suffocated.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.440]   The beautiful weirdness of a CEO,
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.640]   of a leader, of a creator, of a scientist, all that,
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.040]   that's all gone.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.080]   - Well, Steve Jobs wouldn't have kept his job
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.080]   and acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.520]   in today's climate,
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.200]   but he probably would have updated his protocols,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.720]   so to speak. - A little bit, but maybe.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.080]   - You know, he's screaming at employees.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.920]   I mean, these are anecdotes, right?
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.800]   I call them anic-data because people treat them as data,
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.160]   but they're really just anecdotes.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.660]   We don't know, I wasn't there.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:14.680]   But I like the idea of authenticity without oversharing.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.640]   You're very authentic, but there are aspects to your life
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.360]   that I'm aware of that your audiences will never be aware of
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.280]   and there are aspects of your life
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.360]   that I'll never be aware of.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.320]   And so you're still authentic.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.520]   - Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.640]   People are gonna wonder, like,
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.880]   what is this, you have a sex dungeon?
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.380]   What is this? - No, no, no.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.700]   But interesting choice of examples.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:44.320]   No, but I think that people lose careers
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.480]   on the basis of the movement of their thumbs, right?
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.360]   I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:55.360]   recently lost his position based on a response to a tweet.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.480]   People can look that up.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.360]   This is one of the most famous
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.240]   psychiatry departments in the world.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.000]   And he put something out there
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.040]   that was very insensitive, frankly.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.280]   And everyone that I talked to about it was like,
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.080]   gosh, that was very, very insensitive, not thoughtful at all
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.920]   and he lost his job, right?
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.240]   Or at least had to step down, I don't know the specifics.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.680]   So, you know, I think I read someplace
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.720]   that more than half of the job loss due to online behavior
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.920]   is because people were trying to be funny, right?
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.760]   I mean, not everyone can pull off what Tim Dillon,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.000]   oh, and by the way, congratulations.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.520]   I heard that you and Tim just got married.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.360]   Yeah, I saw that. - No, no,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   we didn't just get married.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.560]   He proposed. - Engaged.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.400]   Got it, got it, got it.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.160]   - And I said, yes. - Right.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.640]   So some people can get away, oh yeah.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.960]   - Thank you, thank you, Sergey.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.160]   Has that ready to go. - See those 13.3 thousand likes?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   One of those is mine.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.800]   - So for people who are not aware,
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.240]   one of the days in April tweeted
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.240]   that Tim Dillon asked me to get married and I said yes.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.360]   I think Tim said, "The wedding will be on 6th Street
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.320]   "in Austin, bring all of your weapons,"
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.360]   which of course is totally inappropriate.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.640]   This is, I was funny. - He's a comedian.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.640]   - I was like PG funny and he's goes rated R funny
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.280]   right away, but that said, I mean, if there's anyone
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:20.080]   I would like to get married with, it's that guy.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.440]   And we would do it in Austin and it would be epic.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.240]   It would be like the wedding from November Rain.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.520]   - Mr. and Mrs.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.720]   - Oh wow. - Oh, Mr. and Mr.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.720]   I apologize. - Wow, yeah,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.800]   and you broke tradition with the jacket color.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.760]   So it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.560]   - I think freedom is really important
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.440]   and that includes letting people who are hateful,
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.200]   letting people who are controversial
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.240]   have a voice on platforms, but it becomes,
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.640]   I'm not sure what exactly to think because
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:04.520]   I also treasure the quiet voices in the back of the room
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   and sometimes the assholes silence those voices,
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.280]   meaning by being loud and obnoxious and so on,
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.440]   it pushes away the thoughtful people.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.340]   So I'm also a fan of creating communities.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:23.200]   Like you should be able to let people kind of
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.600]   build a community that's positive, that's loving,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.600]   or that's constantly trolling, or that's super hateful.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.080]   All those communities should have a place in the world,
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.080]   but the thing I've noticed is that hate can destroy,
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.720]   a community full of hate can destroy a community
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.520]   full of love easier than a community full of love
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.000]   can overtake one with hate.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   And so you have to kind of, I don't know exactly how,
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.740]   but create digital mechanisms that discourage
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.320]   the collision of these communities.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.480]   They should all have a platform and ability to speak
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.160]   and to a large audience, but I just,
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.760]   you have to be careful to protect that like little flame
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.320]   of connection that people have.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.440]   - Yeah, that's good, the goodness, it sounds like.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.440]   I mean, yeah, I think in any great city, like New York,
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.480]   which I love, by the way,
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.740]   you want to have a symphony in an opera house
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.400]   and you want some punk rock shows happening
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   on the Lower East Side.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.520]   You want all of that.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.160]   You just don't necessarily want them to overlap.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.840]   In terms of social media,
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.040]   and then podcasts and engagement,
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.600]   one thing that I decided very early on
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.260]   is was to encourage comments and feedback, et cetera.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.980]   But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:46.180]   You've taught in the university
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.040]   and then you teach in the university
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.600]   and you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.120]   of the kinds of questions that you'll tolerate, right?
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.320]   So there's always the student that's gonna ask a question,
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   which is basically a 10 minute monologue
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.120]   about their experience that really isn't a question
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.540]   that pertains to a lot of people.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.600]   So you politely discourage that kind of question
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.800]   and you encourage the kinds of questions
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.180]   that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.520]   It's just more efficient that way.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.440]   - Or not politely, which is much better.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.100]   - You know, I try and respond to comments
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.160]   and I try and respond,
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.000]   but also, you know,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.840]   there's this also this really interesting question.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.640]   Now, if you block people or restrict people,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.080]   people think that you're somehow afraid
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.800]   of the information that they're posting,
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.600]   but that's often not the case.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.760]   I'm not in the habit of blocking
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.840]   or restricting too many people.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.400]   Occasionally we've had to do it
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.760]   only because of how other people
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.900]   are being treated in the comment section.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.300]   What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:37.100]   are two completely different things.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.020]   David Goggins, right, who we both know well,
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:40.920]   I don't know if he still does this,
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.960]   but a few years ago he posted something like,
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.900]   if people ask him, "When do you sleep?"
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.060]   He would just block them.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.940]   Because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:50.780]   Of course he sleeps,
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.640]   but it's, you know,
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.300]   he's trying to get a particular message out.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:54.600]   I think people should just understand
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.500]   that everybody's page is their own to moderate, right?
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.540]   Just like in a classroom,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.280]   there are certain rules, of course, of institution,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.160]   but then you establish the etiquette
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.680]   within the context of the kind of class.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.160]   You know, a class about personality psychology
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.380]   or the psychology of love,
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.920]   you're going to have a very different range of conversations
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:19.200]   than a class on membrane physiology.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.160]   So I think social media is a great place for conversation,
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.880]   but it's not necessarily a great place
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.460]   for every kind of conversation.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.580]   - Yeah, and I also should say
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.560]   that people that do get blocked,
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.260]   I never, this is something I do very deliberately,
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.960]   blocked or ignored, I never think poorly of them.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.980]   I actually explicitly think,
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.760]   if there's somebody that's saying hateful things
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.540]   about me or whatever, I always think positive thoughts.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.680]   It's not some kind of weird guru thing,
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.160]   but I just actually found that as a hack.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.720]   I think well of them,
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.680]   and that allows me to never think of them again.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.200]   Like I send them my love,
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.200]   and I think this is a fascinating human being
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.800]   with a fascinating story.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.600]   I would love to have time to actually learn
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.440]   about their story,
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.160]   but there's not enough time in the world,
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.600]   and I just think well of them,
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.880]   and then I move on and enjoy a delicious meal
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.600]   with people that are close to me and I love and so on,
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.660]   and just move on.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.320]   And never adding to the negativity of like,
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.520]   just even in the privacy of my own mind,
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.680]   thinking a hateful thought towards them.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.480]   It serves no purpose whatsoever.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.080]   - Yeah, I love that about you,
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.540]   and I know that what you just said to be true.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:33.920]   One of the, I think more toxic things in life
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:37.760]   is what's called, you know, evacutive projection.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.260]   When people feel something and they try and evacuate it
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.520]   and project it onto somebody else.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.240]   Projection is fascinating, right?
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.400]   What you essentially just said
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.700]   is that you don't accept projections.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:49.000]   In fact, you transmute them,
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.320]   to put in the language of the Buddhists, you know.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.280]   You transmute it into positivity,
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.860]   and in that way you truly neutralize it.
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.540]   And transmute it.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.900]   I think that if people were better understood
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.340]   when they were experiencing
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.500]   or observing evacutive projection,
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:11.580]   the world would be a much healthier and happier place.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.780]   But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.300]   And, you know, when we're tired or sick or angry,
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.460]   you know, we're hungry, excessively hungry,
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.460]   all of us are less good at it.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.980]   I've been positively struck
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.760]   by the nature of most of the interactions.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.940]   Not just feedback, but my favorite thing,
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.340]   as an educator in the classroom,
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.420]   but also on social media,
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.340]   my absolute favorite thing is when the comments
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:39.700]   about other people's comments are positively reinforcing.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.580]   So you see people having conversations
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.940]   within the comments.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.340]   And you realize, this is like if you,
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.220]   as an educator, again, you know,
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.540]   it's fun to teach and it's fun to talk to the students,
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.900]   but the real pleasure is in walking by
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.180]   a small group of students on campus
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.920]   and hearing them talking about the material.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.380]   That just fills me with joy.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.100]   And because what it means is that
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.840]   the ideas are reverberating in their nervous systems
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.260]   and will eventually wick out to others.
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.700]   So it's not just about feedback,
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.140]   it's about a venue for parsing information.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.700]   - So you actually posted that we're gonna talk on Instagram
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.460]   and I collected a bunch of the questions,
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.700]   which reminds me of,
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:21.040]   I have to mention Mike Jones
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.840]   and a question he asked,
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:26.840]   but also a gift he gave quite a while ago, if it's okay.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.160]   But first, a quick bathroom break.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.440]   - Yes.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.200]   - We're looking at Instagram page of Mike Jones,
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.220]   knife and tool, you should check it out.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:39.480]   Andrew gave me a gift from him
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:44.200]   that is a badass butcher knife.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.680]   "Yours is the earth, dot, dot, dot."
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.840]   It's from "If" by Eric Scherr, Kipling.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.040]   - Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting,
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.740]   perhaps to people where,
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.120]   I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.920]   and it was his birthday.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.160]   I wanna get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.480]   And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones,
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.480]   that I learned about through Joe Rogan.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.380]   'Cause the first, remember in the old days of Joe Rogan,
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.920]   when you go on the episode afterwards,
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.680]   you'd take a picture with an object.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.840]   So it was like Elon with a flamethrower,
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.760]   people would have the ax.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.560]   I picked up this bushwhacker hatchet thing.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.400]   - Nice.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.080]   - And I was like, I love this thing.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.000]   And Joe said, "Oh yeah,
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.280]   you should check out Mike Jones's work.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.520]   He does these beautiful knives."
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.200]   And so then I heard your episode with Joe
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.160]   and you recited a poem at the end.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.320]   It was right after your grandmother died.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.880]   And there's a line in that poem from "If"
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.520]   that Mike engraved on that knife for you.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.760]   So he makes these by hand.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.080]   I love, there it is, the old days of Joe Rogan.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.400]   [both laughing]
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.240]   Before the podcast and all that.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.800]   - That's his first appearance.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.600]   - That was the first time on there.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.880]   And it was a lot of fun.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.360]   In the old studio in Los Angeles.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.160]   And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.480]   And I have this,
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.520]   I just have a great admiration for crafts people.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.720]   So yeah.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.560]   Do you use it?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.520]   Do you cut your one meal a day steaks with it?
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.160]   - I feel.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.640]   - Are you taking it with you on your travels?
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.840]   - Exactly.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:15.280]   I actually used to keep it on the table,
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.320]   but I thought it really intimidates guests.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.160]   - A little bit.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.920]   You can put it on their side.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.760]   - Yeah.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.600]   - Right.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.440]   - It's like, oops.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.000]   - It's trust, right?
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.320]   - What's the story?
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.480]   I mean, yeah.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.920]   But it's 'cause it's not,
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.600]   it's quite badass if I may say.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.520]   So the craftsmanship is obvious,
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.880]   but also it is a knife.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.120]   - It's got some like Dexter-like qualities to it.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:40.960]   - Yeah.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.640]   - It looks like it's designed to cleave through a limb.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.040]   - If I had like a family or something where people,
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.560]   there's nothing about this place that softens your
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   kind of sense that this person might not murder me.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.760]   - Let's put it differently.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.880]   This place could use a woman's touch.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.720]   (laughing)
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.800]   - That's one way to put it.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.760]   If it's okay, let me, because it is a poem I
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.280]   go to often, actually.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.760]   You mentioned reciting some lyrics,
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.240]   and I'm actually gonna go back to that at some point
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.560]   to get a few songs that touch you.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.120]   But this is one of the things I go to often.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.200]   I'll read it to remind myself.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.960]   It's advice from a father to son,
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.120]   and it's a kind of mantra that it's just nice to live by.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.600]   So if it's okay, let me just use this opportunity
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.520]   one more time, read "If" by Roger Kipling.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.800]   If you can keep your head when all about you
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.520]   are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.280]   if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.000]   but make allowance for their doubting too,
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.920]   if you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.000]   or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.920]   or being hated, don't give way to hating,
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.720]   and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.720]   If you can dream and not make dreams your master,
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.880]   if you can think and not make thoughts your aim,
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.320]   if you can meet with triumph and disaster
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:11.440]   and treat those two imposters just the same,
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:14.200]   if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken,
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.040]   twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.720]   or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.440]   and stoop and build them up with worn out tools,
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.000]   if you can make one heap of all your winnings
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.760]   and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss,
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.200]   and lose and start again at your beginnings,
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.200]   and never breathe a word about your loss,
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.000]   if you can force your heart to nerve and sinew
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.040]   to serve your turn long after they're gone,
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.200]   and so hold on when there's nothing in you
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.280]   except the will which says to them, hold on.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.240]   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.680]   I like this one, and walk with kings
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.640]   nor lose the common touch,
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.680]   if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.560]   if all men count with you, but none too much,
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.960]   if you can fill the unforgiving minute
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.600]   with 60 seconds worth of distance run,
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:15.680]   yours is the earth and everything that's in it,
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.080]   and which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.760]   Thank you, Andrew, thank you, thank you, Mike, for the knife.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.600]   I don't know.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.880]   It's an important poem.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.040]   - And engraved in it, yeah, it's yours.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.320]   - Yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.120]   - We toiled over what to engrave,
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.960]   and then finally I just said,
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.840]   Mike, just pick something that speaks to you.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.080]   You're the craftsman, and so he selected that.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.920]   - There's certain ways to pull yourself in that book.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.920]   Actually, Carl Dyseroth, he wrote the book "Projections."
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.520]   One of my favorite, first of all, just as you said,
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55.600]   incredible writer, just, I mean,
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.960]   if you wrote fiction, if you wrote those kinds of things,
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.600]   I'm curious to see where he goes with his writing.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.440]   It's very interesting.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.860]   - I think that book took him 10 years to write,
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.520]   which is vindication for me and for you,
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:07.840]   'cause we're both supposed to write books,
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.040]   and we haven't done it.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.680]   (laughing)
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.600]   - Yeah, I mean, in some sense,
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   your first book will have decades in it, right?
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.620]   Even if you just take half a year to write it.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:27.280]   It's like the first book, like the first album for a musician,
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.840]   I mean, it's a journey.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:35.140]   But he uses poems and quotes in there really well.
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.020]   - It's a beautiful book.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:36.860]   It's a dreamy book.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.540]   I think when people hear that it's a book about neuroscience,
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.240]   they think they're gonna get a textbook
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.940]   or a protocols book or something.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.800]   It's nothing like that, but it really is a deep dive
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.140]   into the mind of the psychiatrist and the researcher,
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.600]   and so much feeling and compassion.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.860]   I love that you love poetry.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:52.780]   I mean, I didn't know that
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.740]   until I saw you on "Rogan Read If,"
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:39:00.740]   and I'm not a very rabid consumer of poetry,
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.180]   but I'm a big Wendell Berry fan,
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:10.640]   and I try and read a poem once every few days.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.440]   Also, I think if is a tough act to follow.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.800]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.080]   - I mean, it's the richness,
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:21.120]   and I mean, you said every third line in there
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.480]   is something that you'd consider your life well-lived
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.780]   if you said that, right?
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.480]   - What about the preparation for the solo podcast?
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.200]   You said you listen to certain songs,
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.220]   you sing or recite the lyrics to certain songs.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.360]   Is there ones that kind of come to mind
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.420]   that are interesting?
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:43.660]   - Yeah, I've always been very lyrics-driven,
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.440]   and I don't understand music.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.640]   I've talked to Rick about this.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.760]   I think I've talked to you about this a little bit.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.200]   I don't really understand.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.960]   I mean, I can hear music and like it,
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:56.600]   but I don't really understand the structure of it,
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:57.440]   but lyrics make a lot of sense to me.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.400]   - But does it touch your soul, music, or is it the lyrics?
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.300]   - It's the lyrics, it's not the instrumentals.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.120]   So I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan,
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.920]   and I'm gonna lose punk points for saying this,
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.360]   but I'm not a Clash fan.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.320]   - Oh, okay.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.240]   - So he obviously is best known for the Clash.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.640]   Most Clash songs start off great,
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.600]   and then after about 30 seconds,
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.500]   at least in my mind,
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.840]   just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush,
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.100]   whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros,
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:22.800]   which is what he did as an adult,
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.840]   as a, you know, later,
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.880]   and some of his solo work.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:28.000]   He actually, Rick produced some work
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.800]   that he did with Johnny Cash.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.920]   You know, Rick pulled Johnny Cash out of,
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.080]   essentially out of retirement
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.920]   and had him do his albums before he died.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.360]   And so anything that Strummer did,
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.920]   there's a favorite song of mine by Strummer.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.000]   It's called "Burning Lights."
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.840]   You can find it,
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.400]   there is an album now where you can find it,
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.360]   or "Tennessee Rain,"
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.280]   or some of these things that he did,
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.560]   which are a little bit more folky,
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.900]   so not really punk.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.280]   So I love that song.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.400]   Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.240]   - Yeah, Rancid is great.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.880]   - You know, and then if I listen to instrumentals,
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.760]   I do, I'll listen to classical piano.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.360]   - Some dreams are made for children.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.100]   - But it's not gonna sound good as a poem.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.720]   They can play the, people can play the song.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.760]   - Play the song, okay.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.880]   - Yeah, so I'll, I mean, 'cause it has to be sung,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   Joe's voice is what makes the song.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.880]   - Got it.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.120]   - Joe's voice is what makes the song.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.760]   But yeah, that song "Burning Lights"
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.800]   from "I Hired a Contract Killer."
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.080]   - I don't know, the lyrics are pretty good.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:23.920]   - They're pretty good.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.480]   I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.920]   I'm a, you know, I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.040]   Glenn Gould for classical piano.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.920]   He was at Asperger's, you know,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.400]   and actually I think you can hear him grunting.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.880]   He had a Tourette's-like tick.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.640]   And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.080]   So I'll listen to any number of things.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.060]   It depends on my mood.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.180]   If I'm feeling a little more tired
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.680]   and I need to be amped up,
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.040]   I'll listen to something that's a little louder and faster.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.560]   If I'm feeling kind of keyed up
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.060]   and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit,
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.880]   then I'll listen to something a little mellower, poppier.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.280]   I love bands like, yeah,
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:02.880]   I'm a big fan of this British pop band called James.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.880]   There's like 20 bands named James, but this one, you know,
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.680]   and again, I lose punk points for saying that,
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.320]   but they're amazing.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.720]   And Best Live- - I think you've accumulated
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.760]   enough points where you can afford to lose a few.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.120]   - Yeah.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.800]   But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are,
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.840]   they're the subconscious, right?
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.560]   I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.920]   or a really good strummer song or a poem
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.040]   that the words don't mean anything when read linearly,
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.640]   but they make you feel something,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.840]   they're tapping into the subconscious.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.080]   That's really what they're doing.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.400]   They're pulling on neural threads of emotion
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.240]   based on either timbre or cadence
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.440]   or something that's independent of the word structure.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.600]   And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.680]   - I often say Johnny Cash's version of "Hurt,"
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:55.000]   that I say would be my favorite song ever.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.640]   - Well, he did a Nine Inch Nails song.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.480]   - He did, he covered- - I think Rick produced that.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.320]   - He produced- - Pretty sure he produced that.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.040]   - Yeah, he produced it.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.080]   I mean, he did, like Rick produced the,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.960]   he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.000]   to produce something that, I mean,
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.400]   when you look back, is one of the great things ever in music,
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.320]   which are these like haunting covers
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.920]   of certain songs and originals.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:25.120]   - Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.000]   of "Redemption Song" together that Rick produced,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.760]   which is on loop in my house sometimes,
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.520]   for hours and hours.
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.960]   - That song is fascinating.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.680]   Bob Marley's song.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.800]   - Sung by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.720]   Sometimes I think what it would be to be a fly on the wall
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.080]   when these guys were doing this stuff.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.760]   - These songs of freedom.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.120]   There's certain songs where you're like,
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:58.600]   elicit an emotion that's unlike anything else.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.960]   I mean, I was trying to figure that out with Rick too.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:04.560]   Like there's certain songs that make you wanna pull out
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:07.280]   over to the side of the road and just weep
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:11.640]   or just get inspired to just get shit done
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.200]   or all of those kinds of things.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.600]   Remember your family, the people you've lost,
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.440]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.280]   And you hurt.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.920]   I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.080]   - There's certain songs that I've loved so much
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.360]   that I actually won't play them during a relationship
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.640]   until the relationship passes a certain duration.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.560]   Because if you start sharing in those experiences
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.680]   with somebody in the room
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.320]   and it starts to become associated with the relationship,
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.680]   you braiding it in with the dopamine of love
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:45.480]   and that relationship ends, the song is forever tainted.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.200]   There are certain songs that I will never play
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.260]   in the company of anybody else.
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.100]   They're mine.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:55.000]   It's too risky to give those up.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.720]   - There's like levels.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.800]   - There are levels, right.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.040]   Exactly.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.840]   We'll leave it at that.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.520]   - Yeah, and the interesting thing about
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.860]   this kind of preparing for the solo episode,
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:17.120]   just interacting with Rick about that process
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.600]   of preparation and,
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.400]   'cause you mentioned with interviews,
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.120]   by the way, are you do solo, solo?
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.960]   Are you the only one in the room or not?
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.160]   - Well, it used to be Rob, my producer,
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.160]   who I should say, he's really the person behind the podcast.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.520]   I mean, first of all, we're equal partners in everything.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.920]   - You're just a pretty face.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.920]   - We're just, and I'm aging, man.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.520]   Not to, I actually really, I like aging.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.360]   It's weird.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.880]   A lot of people, like friends with David Sinclair
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.520]   and it's all about not aging.
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.520]   I don't want to live past 90, 95.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.320]   I'm just trying to get as much done as I can
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.000]   in this short life and do it right
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.520]   and with integrity and heart and accuracy.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.440]   - And you like the stages.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.260]   - Oh yeah.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.340]   If you read Erickson's "Stages of Development,"
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:08.620]   you realize that every stage of life
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:12.120]   is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.140]   And if you're going to try and avoid that progression,
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:18.320]   sure, you might live longer,
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.160]   but it's sort of like saying,
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.400]   do you want to go win the high school jujitsu championship?
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.540]   No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:32.160]   So I actually look forward to the future,
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.960]   even if it means that I'm starting to shift.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.080]   I think that my biology will shift.
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.140]   I'll fight that, I try and take good care of myself,
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.140]   but I don't want to get sick.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.060]   I don't want to suffer, who does?
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.580]   But I'm embracing this whole developmental arc.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.780]   I mean, we're not children and then adults.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:52.820]   Our entire life is one long developmental arc.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.780]   And if you fail to embrace that,
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.420]   you fail to extract the richness
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.620]   of what it is to be a human being.
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:03.620]   So in any event, I record, Rob is in the room.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:08.080]   I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.720]   if I feel like something's not landing right.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.600]   So he gives, if it's clear, he'll let me know.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.360]   If it's not clear, he'll let me know, excuse me.
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.600]   And then Costello used to be in the room,
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.320]   the early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.160]   He's snoring at my feet and farting and smelling up the room
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.960]   and we're all just kind of like gasping for air.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.840]   He's a bulldog, that's what they do.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.200]   With him gone, it changed, the whole thing changed.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.760]   There will be another dog soon.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.540]   And as you know, I've been moving through that grief process
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:41.540]   but having him there gave me a levity that I miss.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.180]   But in my mind, he's still there.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.020]   - Yeah, he's still there.
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:44.900]   - Yeah, he's still there.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:48.940]   So, and in time there'll be another dog and who knows,
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:51.320]   maybe there'll be a dog and a couple infants running around,
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.120]   but that would be more distracting.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.060]   But there's no podcast that exists
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:59.580]   just because of the podcaster.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.500]   This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast for me.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:05.260]   There's, it's not just a staff of people to post stuff.
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:07.080]   That's just the top level contour.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.240]   There's the constant feedback and iteration
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.640]   of what you want it to become
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.560]   and trying to hold on to something
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.560]   that's essential along the way.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.660]   'Cause everything has to evolve,
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:20.480]   but you can't lose the essence of something.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.120]   Anytime a company or brand or a course
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.840]   or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.880]   It just is a, you know,
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.420]   it becomes like a cenotaur version of itself.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:33.600]   - So to Rick is very,
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:36.920]   the power of the people in the room is great
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:39.720]   to inspire and to destroy.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.120]   So you have to be extremely careful
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.480]   with the selection of people that are in the room.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.380]   To me, I never really thought of it that way.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:50.960]   I thought only positive things can happen.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.800]   - Oh, by adding people in the room.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.720]   - By adding people in the room.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.320]   - Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room,
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.160]   well, you know what?
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.000]   Someday I'd love to do a live podcast with you.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:48:59.840]   We're doing--
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.000]   - I think you're doing like a couple of live things,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.380]   which is great that you're paving the way there to--
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:05.320]   - Well, we did one.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.420]   I went up to University of British Columbia
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:11.700]   and did a lecture on a college campus.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.860]   And one of the more gratifying things that happens,
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.060]   this kid, he's in his early 20s, I think,
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:17.540]   stood up and said, "You know,
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:19.740]   I've never been on a college campus.
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.140]   I didn't think I could go onto a college campus."
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.500]   And that still rings in my mind.
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.340]   Whoever you are out there, that meant so much to me.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.600]   'Cause I was like, yes.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.740]   There was something about that to me.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.580]   I was like, okay, it made sense to come all the way up here
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:31.620]   and do this in person.
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.700]   'Cause you can get out to a lot more people online.
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.660]   Public speaking events,
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.580]   it's not like it's that lucrative or anything.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:39.320]   I mean, unless you're, whatever,
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.780]   you're a famous celebrity or politician or something.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:43.100]   I'm sure there are people that do well with it,
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.700]   but that's not what it's about for us.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.240]   It's really about being able to connect with people
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:50.440]   in a different venue and for interactions like that.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.700]   I don't know how many of them we will do,
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:55.500]   but I'm curious to see how it goes.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.940]   But I'd love to do a podcast with you.
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.020]   - Is it energizing?
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:03.780]   My fear is the fear of the introvert,
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:08.020]   is that I don't know if I can handle so much love
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.940]   and fascinating people all around.
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:14.100]   It's like, I don't know.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.180]   - Well, we'll invite a few haters too.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.740]   - Well, yes.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:18.700]   But I love the haters too.
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.880]   But I don't know, it makes me nervous.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.140]   'Cause Jordan Peterson's currently on tour.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.300]   I got a chance to hang out with him when he was here.
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:28.180]   - He does a lot of live speaking.
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.880]   - Yeah, he's now on tour where he does every other day.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.460]   - But he doesn't have any small kids at home anymore.
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.580]   So you can do that.
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:37.420]   So yeah, you should do it before you have a family.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.020]   - It's also exhausting.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.500]   I mean, I'm just speaking from an athlete perspective.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:45.980]   If you're Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones,
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:49.900]   it's just physically, I mean,
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.300]   you have to speak potentially for two hours,
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:57.100]   then off stage, like hanging out with people.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:57.940]   - It's a lot.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.980]   - It's a lot of hours.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:01.060]   It's a lot of hours to stay focused,
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:05.020]   to keep finding your place of like calmness and excitement.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.260]   - Well, and you're staying in hotels,
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:08.100]   your circadian rhythm's disrupted.
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.980]   You're not getting your like cold and sauna
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:13.340]   and your workout every day, your food isn't optimal.
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.180]   I think done in patches, I could enjoy it.
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.780]   'Cause it's fun to meet people from different places.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:20.460]   I'm doing a public lecture in Copenhagen
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.380]   for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.540]   And that one is particularly gratifying for me
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.100]   because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.020]   So the fact that, and then so when they invited,
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.220]   I asked, do you want me to talk about what my lab does?
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.100]   Or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.980]   They're like, no, no, not your lab.
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.980]   We want to hear about this like health stuff
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.900]   and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.860]   So that was amusing to me and tells me
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.340]   that things are changing now.
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:47.700]   I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:50.080]   about people to ourselves.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.020]   But one thing that it made very clear
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.700]   is that there's an enormous appetite for tools
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.740]   for mental and physical health,
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:58.100]   but also understanding about science
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.580]   and how science is done.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.380]   So thanks to you, again, I'm not saying this to flatter you.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:03.740]   It's true gratitude.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:07.300]   There's now a runway for scientists to talk to people.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:09.060]   I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy's name,
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.940]   the virus guy from Columbia.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:12.140]   - Vincent Racaniello.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.340]   - Yeah, amazing, right?
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:16.460]   I mean, forgetting the controversy around all the stuff
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.420]   of 2020, 2021, I mean, he is an encyclopedia
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.880]   of all things virology.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.480]   - Yeah, people should listen to his podcast
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.680]   this week in virology.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.120]   He's also an incredible lecturer and educator.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:30.320]   It's fascinating.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.560]   It's fascinating when people take, again,
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.080]   that leap of putting all that education online.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.240]   That's non-controversial at all.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.280]   It's like everybody, people should go listen to him
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.560]   for the most part in terms of, at his best, at least.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:48.800]   There's no politics in it.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.160]   There's none of that.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.680]   - No, he's a virus jockey.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.480]   He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.820]   and molecular biology.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.480]   - We all say stuff carelessly all the time.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.700]   So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:07.320]   he's said about dismissing lab leak theory.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.160]   There's no way.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:08.980]   - He dismisses that.
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.860]   - Yeah, but he's not making, folks,
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.040]   there's a difference when you say stuff off the cuff
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.400]   and when you say stuff that's core to your principles
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:25.080]   and you've thought about it for a very long time.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.400]   You're talking for hundreds of hours
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.680]   and you can just say stuff.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.420]   You can just say your opinions.
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:34.840]   Will Smith slapped--
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.080]   - I was wondering, okay, wait.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.200]   How long have we been recording?
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.600]   I was wondering how long it was gonna take us
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.440]   before someone brought up--
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.320]   - We talked about Ukraine.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.360]   - No, no, Will Smith.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.240]   I was wondering whether or not we'd make it the,
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.040]   I had it planned.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.920]   I was literally in the back of my mind.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.400]   I had it planned that at the end,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.840]   if we didn't talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing,
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.920]   that I was gonna say, it's amazing.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.600]   This is the first conversation to happen
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.040]   in a long time where it wasn't mentioned.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:58.880]   Oh, no.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.720]   (laughing)
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.840]   - No, not pulling, no, we don't need to see.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.680]   We don't need to see.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.500]   - Here we go.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.340]   It revealed some interesting things
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:08.900]   about human beings, impulse control and lack thereof.
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:11.760]   But, you know, oh my goodness.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.960]   Chris Rock has material for the rest of his career.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.640]   - Yeah, I think he's not short on material.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:21.160]   But I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.640]   if I knew you're allowed to just slap comedians,
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.000]   my conversation with Tim Dillon
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.160]   would have gone very differently.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.240]   People just being humans.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.460]   There's so much fascinating human nature on display there.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:37.440]   It's also, in terms of it becoming a topic
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.360]   that a lot of people are talking about
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.000]   versus the war in Ukraine, for example,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.280]   is also fascinating to watch,
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.040]   like just these kind of news cycles moving through.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.120]   - Well, I think, if I may, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:53.000]   but, you know, anytime we observe something very limbic,
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.240]   very emotional, you know,
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.640]   we generally can empathize somewhat, right?
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:00.960]   We all know what it's like to feel angry.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.240]   We all know what it's like to feel ashamed.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.480]   We all know what it's like to feel shocked.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:09.360]   Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.480]   We see it, it's, you know, they're these images
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.260]   and they're very traumatic and challenging
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.480]   to look at at times, and yet most people have no idea
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.780]   what it feels like to be shot at
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.660]   or what it feels like to have your home destroyed
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:26.260]   or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.180]   So it's very, so I think that people naturally orient
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.760]   towards things that feel familiar to them,
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.560]   even though the circumstances are different.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.500]   - And people also forget, they look at these celebrities,
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:39.920]   it's just like looking at criticism of Will Smith,
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.200]   you forget that they're human too.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.560]   That's one of the most surprising things for me,
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.300]   having done this podcast and met celebrities
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.040]   and stuff like that.
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.040]   They're human, they're all human.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.440]   And that's inspiring to me, like some of these great folks
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:57.480]   that have won Nobel prizes and built some cool things,
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:59.460]   they're just human, like the rest of us.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.400]   - Well, and if you look at actors and actresses,
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.040]   I mean, there's some amazing ones, right?
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.260]   And who also do well in the outside life,
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:09.760]   but their careers were built on the business
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.920]   of pretending to be other people.
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.480]   And that's got to distort maybe positively,
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.000]   but also just let's be honest,
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.020]   what it is that the neuroplasticity there,
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.880]   the changes in the areas of the brain
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:25.400]   that represent personality have to be quite different
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.960]   for somebody who pretends to be lots
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:28.920]   of different personalities and gets paid for it.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.800]   You're working the reward system
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.240]   into the system of self-identity.
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.240]   And you have to imagine that that can really
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.700]   contort somebody's neurology in ways
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:43.760]   that maybe they are not as,
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.840]   maybe they are not in touch with reality
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.040]   in the same way that we are.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.960]   Remember earlier we're talking about
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.440]   neurotic versus psychotic.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.640]   They may be more borderline in their kind of ground state
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.100]   than we think.
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.240]   And so I'm actually impressed anytime there's a celebrity
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.520]   who doesn't have a messed up life.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:02.840]   I'm like, oh, wow, finally somebody who's managed
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.800]   to maintain some semblance,
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:08.240]   at least from the outside, of normalcy.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:11.280]   - So first of all, I can empathize
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.120]   with the actions that Will Smith did, right?
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.480]   They're not, I think they're kind of,
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:18.480]   not kind of, they're just shitty.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:21.520]   You should probably talk privately, man to man.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.640]   Not, 'cause otherwise it's like a dramatic display.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.960]   It's almost like you are a fake, you're acting.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.680]   - Well, there are all these questions, right?
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.120]   I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.160]   There's this question of whether or not it was impulsive.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:37.360]   I think most people feel yes.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.520]   There's a question, there was the protective nature of it
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:42.240]   because he was doing it to, you know,
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.920]   apparently in defense.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.160]   But then there's also the context.
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.460]   He lost touch with the context, right?
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.720]   Whereas Chris Rock basically gets,
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:56.720]   there's the possible critique that he went too far.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:59.120]   That's gonna be in the eye of the beholder.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.560]   But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes,
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.040]   but then there's also the fact that he took that slap
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:05.160]   and then just snapped right back,
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.440]   so much so that people thought maybe it was faked.
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.960]   He also waited with his hands behind his back.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   - That's just natural.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.200]   He likes to stand like that.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:17.200]   I mean, I gotta tell a little bit of a story here
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:22.680]   to connect to what Chris Rock did.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.680]   Like I wish, what Chris Rock did
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.480]   in terms of just taking a slap and keep going,
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:30.680]   first of all, just props for somebody
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:33.720]   that's able to maintain cool in that situation
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.200]   for the most part.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:36.880]   I think I'd like watched it once.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.840]   - You only have to be alive on this planet
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.680]   to see it. - Yeah, I know.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:42.040]   It's hard to have a watch. - You can't avoid seeing it.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.720]   - I wish at that afterwards,
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:49.480]   he would sort of say something loving and kind
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:54.000]   to Will Smith and his wife and then hit him real hard.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.720]   Lean into the joke.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.080]   But I think in hockey, they call it taking a number.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.120]   I have a friend who plays hockey,
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.760]   and there's this idea that if someone checks you
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:06.240]   really badly in one game, you don't go and check them again.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.240]   You don't get into a fight.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.120]   But three games later, you blade them in the shin.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:18.240]   The ability to defer and to handle it
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:20.240]   in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.420]   - They're probably also friends
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:24.160]   and all those kinds of things that they respect each other,
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.920]   so he probably didn't.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.560]   But there's a comedian instinct.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:32.560]   I saw this, I was in an open mic here in Texas.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.120]   I won't say where.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.200]   There's many open mics.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:36.440]   - We've gone to a few of these.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.480]   These are pretty fun. - Yeah, we've gone.
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.480]   No, so there is more sort of rougher kind of--
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.920]   - Yeah, you've been hanging out in like West Texas lately.
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.920]   - Exactly. - Austin's too tame for Lex,
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.560]   so he's like head to West Texas.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.800]   - Exactly.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.720]   I put on a cowboy hat, and instantly I became a cowboy.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.560]   I've been talking like a cowboy.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:58.920]   I mean, I belong out there in the desert.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:02.160]   - He's gone from eating meat and athletic greens
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:03.240]   to rattlesnakes.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:04.920]   Rattlesnake jerks. - Rattlesnakes, exactly.
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:06.640]   No, there was a open mic.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:08.440]   It was late at night,
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:11.040]   and I was one of the only people in the audience.
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:15.280]   There's a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:20.280]   One of them was a couple, like bikers,
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:23.640]   like with helmets and so on, a guy and a girl.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.540]   And then the comedian, the open mic comedian,
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:31.720]   did a joke about people who wear helmets.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.320]   I don't know if it was on purpose or not,
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.760]   but he did the joke.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.960]   And then the guy about women who wear helmets,
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.740]   and the guy, it's this exact same situation.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:44.160]   The guy stood up, walked up to him.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:45.000]   There was no slap.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.360]   It's so interesting 'cause this happened
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:47.880]   before the Will Smith thing.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:51.160]   So he walked up to the comedian
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000]   and said, I think he pointed his finger down
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.400]   and told him to stop or something like that,
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.920]   and then sat down.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:05.080]   This is an audience of like six people.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.160]   At midnight around then, there's nobody,
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:10.480]   no security, nothing.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.920]   - In Texas. - In Texas.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:14.200]   - Which implies-- - And then this guy
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.520]   was the energy, drunk but also a biker,
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.520]   and what he felt, his lady was now attacked
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.560]   by the comedian with his words.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:32.920]   And the comedian was a kind of out of shape, small guy.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.160]   So he's not threatening at all and probably in trouble.
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:39.240]   And the comedian, after he sat down,
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:41.360]   he looked a little bit scared.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:46.360]   He paced back and forth, and then he did the joke again.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.640]   - Wow.
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.800]   - And I was sitting, and I started,
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.260]   I leaned back and I just did this like.
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.120]   Because that is comedy.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.640]   And the guy was getting angrier and angrier,
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:02.920]   and he just sat there.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.080]   And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.280]   and then did another bad joke,
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.680]   but another joke about him.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.680]   It's just like he leaned into it.
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:14.120]   - If you go to a small comedy club,
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.200]   open mic or otherwise, you're in the shooting gallery.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.880]   Like you're basically there teed up as a pin to get it.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.320]   We went and saw Andrew Scholls in San Francisco.
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.160]   - In San Francisco?
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:26.360]   - Yeah, it was hilarious.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.200]   It was amazing.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.000]   I mean, he's just masterful in his ability
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.440]   to command an audience.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.360]   But I felt for the people up front,
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:37.400]   but no sympathy either because you buy tickets
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.440]   to sit up front at a Scholls show, you're gonna get it.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.120]   But he was very loving.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:46.080]   - Yeah, and funny, first of all, funny.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.280]   The funniness really helps you,
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.800]   but the ethic of the comedian is that fearlessness.
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.520]   What I really liked is the danger,
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.720]   there's risk to comedy, and there's also consequences.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:02.280]   - Have you watched that show,
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.560]   what is it, "The Marvelous Miss Maisel Show"?
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.800]   It's really good.
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.120]   I watched a few of them, "Guilty Pleasure" there.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.040]   She plays a comic in the, I think it's the mid-1960s
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.560]   in New York, and there's a character
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:18.960]   that somewhat resembles Lenny Bruce.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:21.240]   It's sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:24.240]   And they're always getting arrested and this kind of thing.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.640]   I think I learned about it from Joe.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.940]   Anyway, the writing's great, it's very funny.
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:32.480]   But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries, right?
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.960]   And to say the thing that other people aren't,
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.200]   feel they can't say.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.480]   Not something in science, right?
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.480]   Science, you're supposed to,
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:43.360]   etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:46.320]   It's about constraining communication.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.440]   This is something, I mean, I confess on the podcast,
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.680]   in the goals of making it clear,
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:54.520]   interesting, surprising, and actionable,
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.080]   you have to constrain the amount
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.440]   and the style of information.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:01.240]   Otherwise it becomes something else altogether, right?
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.480]   - I saw Sander Parchai, Google CEO,
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.680]   said that he likes the thing you mentioned.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:12.000]   Not the Yoga Ninja, but the NSDR,
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.040]   non-sleep deep rest podcast over meditation.
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.000]   I don't know if you saw that.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000]   - I saw that, yeah.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.520]   - Why, what do you think the difference is?
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.640]   - Yeah, so non-sleep deep rest, NSDR,
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.480]   is an acronym that I coined
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:28.480]   because it encompasses a lot of practices
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:31.220]   that are not meditation per se,
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.840]   but that bring the brain and body
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.000]   into a state of relaxation and focus.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.120]   So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.600]   There are other variants of NSDR.
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.640]   You can just look these up and you'll find them.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.480]   And I think that they've caught on
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:47.480]   and that the CEO of Google is an avid practitioner of NSDR
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.600]   because it has this amazing ability
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.000]   to reset your energy levels and focus.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.480]   Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.920]   And part of the reason they find it hard
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.000]   is that it requires focus.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.400]   NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.620]   You don't have to work too hard.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:06.880]   You're just listening to a script.
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:09.040]   Whereas most forms of meditation, not all,
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.920]   but most forms of meditation involve cranking up
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.240]   the activity in your prefrontal cortex
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.680]   and trying to see your thoughts
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:18.080]   as opposed to thinking your thoughts,
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.240]   or focus on your breath,
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:23.360]   but then third-personing yourself in some respect.
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.200]   And that's work.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:26.600]   And so many people who meditate quite intensely
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:28.240]   feel more exhausted.
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:30.200]   Now that doesn't mean that meditation
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.620]   doesn't have any utility,
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.960]   but it's distinctly different than NSDR.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.480]   And I think that people are working,
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.280]   certainly the CEO of Google, I have to imagine,
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.480]   is working very hard and using his forebrain.
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:42.280]   If he's going to have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break,
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:44.400]   he should, and I think this is what he's doing,
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:46.960]   he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:48.760]   and just kind of let his mind wander,
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:52.360]   or sit there in a chair and just zone out, or do NSDR.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:57.360]   The problem is people are not that good at shifting states.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:59.280]   We are all actually pretty good at,
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.820]   even people with severe ADHD,
[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.440]   we had an episode about this,
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:07.240]   can become hyper-focused on things that they actually enjoy
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:10.460]   because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:12.640]   are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine.
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:13.480]   So when you like something,
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:15.280]   there's dopamine release and you can focus.
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:17.120]   It's when you don't like something that's hard to focus,
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:18.840]   shifting states is hard.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:19.880]   I'm sure you've experienced this
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.440]   if you've ever been in deep research
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.680]   or podcasting, podcasting,
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.560]   and then all of a sudden you go for a run,
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:27.160]   you probably spend the first third of that run thinking.
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:28.400]   And then in the middle third,
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:30.920]   you're kind of, that thinking is fractured a bit.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.080]   And then in the final third
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:34.280]   is where you finally get to relax
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.100]   because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly.
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.120]   We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:41.680]   We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly,
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:45.020]   but we don't shift between different states of consciousness
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:49.400]   like a step function, except in rare cases, right?
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.440]   Fear is one.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.960]   All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now,
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:52.880]   it's a step function.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.640]   We're in fear or we're in alertness, right?
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:57.960]   A heightened state of alertness.
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:01.000]   But NSDR is terrific at allowing people
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.040]   to learn to shift their state.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.160]   And I actually would venture to argue
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:09.920]   that part of the value of meditation and exercise
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.460]   is the actual state that you get into
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:13.400]   in deep meditation or exercise.
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:16.160]   But just as valuable is the transition
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:17.720]   that you have to take yourself through
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.960]   from one state of mind to the other and then back again.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.520]   When I look, David Goggins, he always seems to come up,
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.980]   but he, 'cause he represents so many important things,
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:29.640]   drive, determination, override of emotional state,
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.600]   going from being a 300 pound plus person
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.800]   to a fit person through,
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.600]   he's never revealed anything substantial
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:36.800]   about what he ate or what he didn't eat.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.160]   He's basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.000]   Right? - Yeah.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.080]   - But what's remarkable is so much of what he says
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.280]   is about those transitions,
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:49.000]   about taking oneself from a state of, I don't want to,
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.360]   to scruffing oneself and like, you're gonna do it anyway.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.600]   And then being able to carry that
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:56.440]   into regular life, so to speak.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:08:00.160]   So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.280]   It's zero cost.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.680]   And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.240]   is that most people don't stick to a meditation practice.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.400]   There are also been a few cases,
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.320]   you might find this interesting.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.960]   There's a book by Scott Carney.
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:13.120]   I forget what it's called.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.280]   I think it's called "The Transcendence Trap" or something.
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.240]   I'm gonna have that title wrong.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.120]   But there have been a fair number of cases of people
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:22.600]   that go and do very extensive meditation,
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:24.520]   silent meditation retreats,
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.160]   who then return to normal life
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:28.080]   and end up killing themselves.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:31.360]   There are states of mind inside of extended meditations
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.040]   or silent meditations that are very beneficial.
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:37.020]   And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:39.040]   But I know at least one person who came back
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.120]   from one of these long extended meditation retreats
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.720]   and wasn't able to shift their state back
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:45.680]   into one that was functional in regular life.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.640]   And that book includes a very dramatic story.
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.280]   I don't want to give it away in case people
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.120]   check out the book.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.520]   But Scott told the story to me directly once
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:58.120]   where someone feels they've reached enlightenment
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.480]   and then commits suicide.
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:04.840]   So these very unusual brain states are potentially hazardous
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:07.240]   if people can't return from them.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.040]   - So it's nice to focus not on those brains states,
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.560]   but instead on the shifting.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.400]   - Right.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.240]   I do, this morning I woke up a little bit earlier
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.080]   than I would have liked.
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.840]   I use this Reverie app that's research-backed,
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.600]   reveri.com.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.320]   There's a free version of it and,
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.360]   or you can try it for free.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.200]   So I feel comfortable.
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.020]   - That's for hypnosis?
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:25.860]   - For hypnosis.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:29.160]   And I do a self-hypnosis to put me back into sleep.
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:29.980]   And if I can't sleep,
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:31.520]   just put me into a state of deep relaxation.
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:35.280]   I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR,
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.200]   yoga nidra under the category of NSDR.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.480]   There are now some NSDR scripts online.
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:40.720]   If you just go to YouTube that are,
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:42.080]   you can just listen to and.
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:43.120]   - Do you like those?
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:43.960]   - I do.
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.340]   Yeah, I think the one from Made For is quite good.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:46.860]   I have an affiliation with them, but it's free.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.520]   So I feel comfortable mentioning it.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.840]   I do, I really like the Reverie app.
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.720]   I can very, and as the more you do them,
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.000]   the more quickly you can shift your brain
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.720]   into a state of deep relaxation.
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:59.760]   I will sometimes stop mid podcast.
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.440]   If it's, sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.640]   and I'll stop and I'll do a one minute hypnosis.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.560]   They have one minute hypnosis inside Reverie.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.120]   You're only going to,
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.220]   you're only going to find that one minute hypnosis
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:13.520]   is effective if you are routinely doing 10
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.960]   and 15 minute hypnosis in addition to that.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.440]   Meaning I do it every other day or so, a 10 or 15.
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.960]   - So there's a, is there a YouTube one minute hypnosis
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:23.800]   or is this for the Reverie?
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.480]   - There are, but inside of Reverie as well.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:26.600]   You can find them online.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:27.440]   A really good--
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.600]   - Pull it up so I can get it please.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:29.600]   - Yeah, so Reverie is good.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:32.960]   And then Michael Sealy, S-E-A-L-E-Y.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.600]   He has some long hypnosis scripts,
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.320]   but again, these are all free.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.240]   And you know, there's a lot of good research now
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.080]   on the neural networks and it shifts
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:43.800]   your so-called default network, the default mode network.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.880]   It shifts how much of your forebrain you're using.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.700]   And it also is very, very good.
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:51.920]   If you, I get so many questions about,
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.080]   hey, I'm really upset.
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.880]   I found out about my girlfriend's sexual past,
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:57.120]   or hey, I'm so upset.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.420]   I found out that my boyfriend was cheating,
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:10:59.940]   or oh, so-and-so died.
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:01.300]   How do I get over these emotions?
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:02.380]   How do I deal with them?
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:04.640]   And hypnosis has shown to be very useful
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.760]   for people to learn to bring themselves
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:08.600]   into a state of deep relaxation,
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.080]   to literally project in their mind's eye
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.400]   these very intense things that they don't like.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.600]   And then for people to associate with other emotions
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.440]   in their body, to learn to be calm
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.660]   while feeling your feelings,
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:26.900]   to dissociate the mind-body communication to some extent.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:28.500]   - Just observe the feelings.
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.340]   - Observe them and start to associate them
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:31.840]   with positive experiences.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.800]   You're an Android guy,
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.100]   so soon it should be available on Android.
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:36.700]   - Well, then it doesn't exist for me.
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:37.540]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.860]   - It's only, you know, I don't get--
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:40.820]   - Android is the device of the people,
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.060]   all you elitist people with your iPhones.
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:44.500]   - Okay, but tell me this about Android.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.780]   Now you want to, this is the one thing that gets me.
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:48.620]   - Yeah.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:49.460]   - 'Cause I'm very close to someone
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:50.780]   who uses an Android phone.
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:51.780]   I feel like that--
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.980]   - So you have great people in your life,
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:54.820]   that's good to know.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:56.780]   - No, their messages always look green to me,
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:59.340]   but I answer yours, not despite that.
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:02.300]   But they, I feel like the Android phones
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:03.500]   are very trigger happy.
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.380]   Like anything I touch does something,
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:07.260]   whereas the Apple phone is kind of built
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:10.100]   for like a macaque monkey to be able to operate,
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:12.500]   which is great for me because I'm more of a macaque monkey
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.180]   and you're a more sophisticated ape.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:15.860]   - Oh, I see, I see.
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:16.700]   - I think like you have to be quite a bit--
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:17.660]   - They're more sensitive.
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:18.700]   - Yeah, you have to have, you know,
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:20.260]   I mean, I've got fat fingers, you know,
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:21.700]   I've got clumsy fingers.
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:24.260]   - And the Android is too, well,
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:26.500]   maybe you need to soften your touch.
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:27.900]   - What I would do is go into the most,
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.480]   sort by most popular,
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:32.180]   'cause there's some older ones that I really like
[02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:33.420]   and it generally scales with that.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:35.500]   So I'll do the, this one,
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:38.900]   the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:41.240]   That's an hour long one, the sleep and anxiety one,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.100]   40 minutes, but those you listen to as you fall asleep.
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:44.940]   - As you fall asleep.
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:45.780]   Oh, we're gonna do this now?
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:47.180]   - Yeah, yeah, listen to it.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:52.100]   - And I have created this hypnosis recording for you
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.940]   to help you--
[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:53.940]   - And this is the voice.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:55.900]   How often does the voice pop up?
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.140]   - And at the same time--
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:59.140]   - You don't watch it, you just listen to it.
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:00.300]   - Your anxiety.
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:06.060]   Now, one of the most important things to remember
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:10.300]   at the outset of any self hypnosis experience
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:13.300]   is to know and understand that hypnosis--
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.900]   People really should know that stage hypnosis
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:19.140]   is about the hypnotist getting you to do things
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:20.380]   you wouldn't normally do.
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:23.380]   Self hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here,
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:26.480]   reverie in this, is about you getting your brain
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:28.520]   into the state that you want.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:32.060]   And again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data
[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:34.300]   and work on trauma and pain relief.
[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:36.940]   And our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab.
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:39.340]   I really encourage people to explore NSDR.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.560]   And if this feels a little too wacky and out there,
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.640]   then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.500]   and there's some good NSDR scripts.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:49.740]   - Yeah, by the way, Sander is a fan of your podcast.
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:50.900]   No, it's okay, we don't need to play.
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:52.340]   - Yeah, so I don't know him,
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:56.700]   but I get a lot of media outlets picked up
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:58.860]   on his love of NSDR.
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.660]   And I have to imagine running Google involves a lot of,
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:02.860]   juggling a lot of--
[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:05.540]   - He's one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:06.500]   Everybody loves him.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:07.500]   - Have you interviewed him?
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:10.300]   - No, but we'll do the interview eventually.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:13.680]   So it's this annoying thing about me being a stickler
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.440]   for three hours, CEOs don't seem to understand,
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:20.360]   like, not understand, but it's scheduling.
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.360]   So what happens is Sander said,
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:23.520]   "Yes, definitely, let's do it.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.020]   "I'm a fan of the podcast, as a fan of yours."
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:30.040]   And then he goes to his executive assistant like,
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.100]   "Oh, let's find a slot."
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:33.600]   And then they immediately think,
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:35.360]   "All right, well, one hour is good."
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.360]   - 45 minutes.
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.200]   - 90 minutes.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.020]   - By Zoom.
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:38.860]   - 90 minutes.
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:40.900]   - Yeah, right, well, no, they know in person,
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.140]   I'm a stickler on that.
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:45.140]   But it's like, no, we need more.
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:47.500]   And it's so hard to--
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:49.580]   - Do you still travel to do your podcast or generally?
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:52.300]   - No, most people come down here, most people.
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:56.020]   But for certain situations, obviously,
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.700]   like if you're in prison.
[02:14:57.700 --> 02:14:58.540]   - Right.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.360]   (laughing)
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.200]   - Or you're ahead of--
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:01.780]   - Imagine if you get out on work for a little,
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:03.780]   the people have anklets so that they can go
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:04.900]   to an Alex Friedman podcast.
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:05.780]   It'll probably happen.
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:07.340]   Have you ever been in a prison?
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.340]   - No.
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:13.140]   Either a visitation or on the inside.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:15.420]   - From my hike, I can see San Quentin.
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:17.340]   It's really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz,
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:19.020]   Bay Area, beautiful, everyone thinks,
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:21.220]   like there's the Bay and there's Alcatraz
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:22.060]   and San Quentin sitting right there.
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:23.500]   - How does that make you feel?
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:27.100]   - It's amazing how easy it is to overlook
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:28.480]   that they're there and forget that they're there.
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.720]   But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.060]   I also think about the people who are in there
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:34.740]   who might be innocent.
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.140]   I've seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:40.140]   Amanda Knox talks a lot about this, right?
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:42.580]   Whether or not you believe her story or not,
[02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:44.820]   I happen to believe her story personally
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:45.860]   based on what I know.
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:48.820]   I'm sure there are people who disagree with me.
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:52.760]   I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:55.300]   and know in your heart's heart you didn't do it.
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:16:01.100]   I mean, I can't think of many things worse.
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:02.780]   I can't think of many things worse.
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:05.180]   - That's so clearly unjust,
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:09.460]   but life is full of unjust things like this.
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:12.480]   Cruel things happen all the time.
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.580]   You lose a loved one for no good reason.
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:17.840]   You lose your job.
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:21.640]   You lose your home.
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:24.500]   Yeah, I've been talking to a lot of refugees now,
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.980]   and the war in Ukraine has really focused my mind
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:29.340]   to how much suffering there is in the world.
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:32.140]   And so just cruel things happen all the time.
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:36.420]   And people kind of, there's this suffering,
[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:38.740]   and you kind of go on.
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:41.180]   You stick to the people really close to you.
[02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:44.420]   There's still love all around you.
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:46.780]   Traumatic events kind of focus your mind
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:50.780]   on the very practical, like, okay,
[02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:51.860]   how do we solve the problem?
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:52.740]   How do we escape?
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:56.860]   Let's solve, like, survival, food, shelter, focus.
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:00.220]   - Remember that book, "All's Quiet on the Western Front"
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.060]   by World War I?
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:01.880]   There's this line in there.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.020]   I forget what it is, about how war
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.100]   is like the smell of a skunk.
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:09.820]   Like a little bit is actually a little bit is slightly,
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.740]   there's something slightly delicious of it,
[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:14.860]   is what it says in the book.
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:16.860]   I happen to like the smell of like ferrets
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:17.700]   and skunks and things.
[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:19.420]   I had a pet ferret when I was a kid.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:21.620]   And I like that musky scent.
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:23.740]   People, most people, just it's repulsive to them.
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.580]   It's actually a gene, believe it or not.
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:26.960]   Some people have the gene that makes
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.360]   that the musky scent repulsive.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.380]   Some people love it.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:32.740]   Let me ask you this.
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.580]   There's another gene.
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:34.860]   This is a fun one.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:38.220]   Microwave popcorn smells good, neutral, or disgusting to you?
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:39.280]   - Good, very good.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:40.460]   - There are people who have a gene
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:43.060]   that leads them to the perception
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:46.120]   that the smell of microwave popcorn that you find is good.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.340]   It smells like putrid vomit to them.
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:51.120]   It's a particular gene variant.
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:52.520]   And they can smell certain elements
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.560]   within the microwave popcorn.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.800]   It's pretty, it's prominent in France, this gene.
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:04.320]   And so in laboratories where you have a lot of French people
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:05.600]   it's often said like you're not allowed
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:06.600]   to make microwave popcorn.
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:08.560]   It smells putrid, disgusting.
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.220]   So a lot of it's in the perception of the beholder.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:19.440]   - But okay, before I leave the NSDR, focus in general.
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:23.600]   As you said, it's for shifting mind states.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.600]   Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus on a task?
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.200]   - Yes.
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.520]   First of all, we have to distinguish
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.760]   between modulators and mediators.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.700]   And I'll do this very briefly.
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.340]   There are a lot of things that will modulate
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:39.200]   your state of focus,
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.140]   but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus.
[02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:44.960]   So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:48.060]   in this building, it would modulate our attention.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.000]   We would get up and leave.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.440]   It would be very hard to do what we're doing
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.220]   with that banging in the background, at least at first.
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:55.800]   So it's modulating focus,
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:59.800]   but it's not really involved in the mechanisms of focus.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.440]   In the same way, being well-rested when you sleep,
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:06.560]   your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.120]   of alertness and focus and calm works better
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.560]   than when you're sleep deprived.
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:12.560]   So if you're sleeping better, you're going to focus better.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:15.760]   So I always answer this way to a question like this,
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:18.440]   because the best thing that anyone can do
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:20.640]   for their mental health, physical health, and performance
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:23.360]   in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:24.920]   is to make sure that you're getting
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:28.360]   enough quality sleep, enough of the time for you.
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.200]   And that's going to differ.
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:30.380]   We could talk about what that means.
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:33.360]   Now, in terms of things that mediate focus
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:35.120]   without getting into the description of mechanisms,
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.880]   'cause we have podcasts about that,
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.040]   it's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus,
[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.960]   provided that you're a sighted person.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:47.660]   Much of the training that's being done now in China
[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:49.560]   to teach kids to focus better,
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.980]   literally has them stare at a target,
[02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:55.720]   blinking every so often, but really training themselves
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:59.480]   to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:03.220]   When you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture.
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:04.940]   You're literally scrolling like a highlighter
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:06.580]   in your mind's eye, right?
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:08.140]   It's kind of obvious once you hear it.
[02:20:08.140 --> 02:20:10.900]   So for people that have problems focusing sleep well,
[02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:17.020]   learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously.
[02:20:17.020 --> 02:20:19.660]   This can be done if you practice it a little bit.
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:21.420]   And then, as I said before,
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:23.340]   it is very hard to get into a state of focus
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:26.020]   like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers.
[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:28.260]   What you can do is you can pick any object,
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:31.540]   but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:32.920]   placed at roughly the same distance
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:34.620]   to which you're going to do that work,
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:35.820]   and stare at it.
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:37.100]   You're allowed to blink.
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.460]   And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:40.940]   to understand that's normal,
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.380]   but try and narrow your visual aperture
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:45.980]   and bring that into your visual field
[02:20:45.980 --> 02:20:47.420]   so that that's the most prominent thing,
[02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:49.300]   kind of like portrait mode in your phone.
[02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:51.000]   This would look very different in portrait mode
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.540]   than it would in just a standard photograph mode.
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:57.140]   And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:58.860]   moving into the work that you're about to do
[02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:01.260]   and really encourage yourself to do that.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:03.500]   If you're somebody who's low vision or no vision,
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:05.140]   you're going to use your ears to do this.
[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:08.380]   Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:11.660]   'cause they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff.
[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:15.180]   So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.460]   And then of course, the pharmacologic tools,
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:20.780]   just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:22.440]   We've talked about white noise, brown noise,
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.720]   music or no music, really varies.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.840]   But it's very clear that binaural beats of 40 Hertz
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:31.320]   can shift the brain into a heightened state
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:32.600]   of focus and cognition.
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:34.040]   So if you're going to use binaural beats,
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:37.080]   which should definitely be used with headphones,
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:40.000]   and there are a number of free apps out there and sources,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.220]   40 Hertz seems to be the frequency
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:45.760]   that best supports the brain shifting
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:46.600]   into a particular mode of focus.
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:49.600]   - So can you give us some binaural beats?
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.060]   - Yeah, so you're going to look for,
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:54.920]   you'd want to find an app that offers 40 Hertz.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:59.920]   I think Brainwave allows you to slide bar
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.480]   up to the particular frequency that you want.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.220]   And I should say that there are other frequencies
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:07.960]   that are interesting, but 40 Hertz binaural beat
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.080]   seems to be the one that there's the most
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:11.480]   quality research on.
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:12.680]   - It's like a beat.
[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:13.520]   - Yeah.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:16.300]   - But you're saying there's a lot of mixed science
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:19.360]   on the white noise and brown noise.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:21.520]   - You really should be doing this with headphones
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.160]   because binaural beats are best accomplished
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:26.200]   by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:28.200]   And then you have what's called this brainstem area
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:30.280]   that reads out what are called interaural time differences.
[02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:33.160]   And then it extracts the delta essentially.
[02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.000]   - Turn it up.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:41.280]   - And then in other things that can enhance focus.
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.320]   So, you know, the pharmacology around this
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:44.160]   is pretty interesting.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.640]   Things that tickle the dopamine pathway
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.800]   and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:48.720]   - Yeah.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.880]   - There's your Ritalin, your Adderalls, your modafinils,
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.840]   which are prescription.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:54.120]   And there's a lot of non-prescription use
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.680]   of those prescription drugs.
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:59.880]   Not so much in my generation, but in people 35 and younger.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:02.420]   You know, I hear all the time from day traders
[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:04.720]   and programmers and stuff and kids that play video games,
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:07.000]   a lot of Ritalin Adderall use.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.920]   I think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:10.820]   for a specific purpose of ADHD,
[02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:12.960]   I don't think people should go that route, frankly.
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:15.000]   Hits the dopamine system way too hard.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.600]   Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects,
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:21.520]   all sorts of things that you just wouldn't want.
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:25.000]   There are a few compounds like alpha GPC,
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.760]   300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:28.960]   with a cup of espresso.
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:32.720]   If you're well-rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes,
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:35.240]   maybe two hours, but then it's gonna taper off
[02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:37.360]   and you have to just recognize that.
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:39.800]   And then there's this whole world of nootropics now
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:43.240]   and people trying to figure out the racetams, paracetams
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:45.560]   and phenylethylamine combined with this.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:47.200]   And, you know, it's not quite in the place
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.360]   where you'd like it to be.
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.600]   There are a few companies that are doing this
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:50.480]   better than others.
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:51.960]   We talk about some of these on the podcast,
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:55.240]   but I would always start with behavioral tools
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:57.400]   and then consider pharmacology.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:01.880]   And then I suppose the other thing for focus is,
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:03.120]   this is a little more esoteric,
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:07.100]   but we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:09.960]   Where you place your screen is important.
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:12.840]   Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:15.120]   as placing it at eye level or above you.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.600]   When the eyes are up, literally,
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.640]   or when your eyes are directed forward or up,
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:21.040]   the brainstem centers for alertness are activated.
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.320]   When your eyes are down, it's actually,
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:25.320]   you're sort of, it's like being pulled underwater
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:27.760]   a little bit in the autonomic arousal sense.
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:32.480]   It's, you're closing your eyes is one,
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.440]   it reflects the brainstem centers
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.840]   that are active becoming less, or for alertness,
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:39.840]   excuse me, becoming less active.
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:41.020]   But there's a really cool effect
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:42.560]   that's active in this room right now,
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:45.280]   which is that there've been some really interesting studies
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.160]   that when people work in small compact spaces
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:49.760]   or wear a hoodie or a hat,
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:53.320]   that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.640]   for obvious reasons now, based on what I said before.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.640]   But also analytic work or the kind of work
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:02.240]   where there's a correct answer that you're seeking
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:05.460]   is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments.
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:07.920]   Whereas there's something called the cathedral effect,
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:09.800]   which is when you work in an outdoor environment
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:11.140]   or a high ceiling environment,
[02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:14.660]   it lends itself to kind of pun intended,
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:17.640]   kind of loftier ideas and more creativity.
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:19.180]   And that probably has to do with the fact
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:21.280]   that there's a natural tendency, a reflex
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:23.220]   to expand your visual field
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:25.160]   in these high ceiling environments.
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:28.480]   Expansion of the visual field
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:31.800]   changes the way the brain works in the time domain.
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.100]   Your engineering and biology oriented listeners
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.700]   will understand this for the, and music.
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:39.940]   For those that don't, the best way to think about it
[02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:42.800]   is when you have a narrow focus portrait mode on your phone
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:47.540]   or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:50.680]   It's like a, think of it as a high frame rate,
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:52.760]   like you're shooting in slow motion.
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:56.000]   When you have a, when you dilate your view,
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.040]   you're taking bigger time bins.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.000]   And that one way to just let this hopefully land home
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.540]   is that if you've ever had a really exciting day
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:08.260]   or podcast interview or experience of any kind,
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.500]   your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine,
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:13.800]   alertness and motivation, all this excitement.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:16.000]   It seems like it goes by very, very fast.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.540]   And yet when you think back to that,
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:19.820]   it seems like a lot happened.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.860]   This happened and that happened.
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:23.160]   Now think about waiting in the doctor's office
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:24.440]   in a blank waiting room
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:26.720]   with no interesting art on the walls.
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:29.040]   It feels like it goes by very, very slow.
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.840]   Dopamine and norepinephrine are at all time low.
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:33.920]   And yet when you think back on that experience,
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:35.360]   it's as if nothing happened
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:39.220]   because you were parsing time differently.
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:41.220]   So those are the roughly the tools
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:43.740]   and the neurochemicals around time perception
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:44.900]   and the time domain.
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:46.740]   There's a wonderful book, I'm forgetting the title.
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:48.220]   So wonderful I forget the title,
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:50.940]   by Dean Buodomano from UCLA.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:53.460]   But I think it's called "The Brain is a Time Machine"
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:56.140]   that talks about this expansion and contraction
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.260]   of the time domain and what you can do
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:01.060]   to leverage it for work and creativity focus and so on.
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:03.740]   - Yeah, it's fascinating that I think one way
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:07.720]   to define focus for me is the experience,
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.520]   the feeling of focus is losing track of time.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.880]   Is getting to a place where you're no longer
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.960]   operating in time.
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.440]   - Well, and you mentioned being,
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:21.960]   kind of cramming for something,
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:24.120]   where you'll release a lot of adrenaline.
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:27.660]   And it is true, you can get a lot done under pressure
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:30.080]   because of the way that you're slicing time.
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.040]   You don't actually have more time.
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:34.020]   It's that you're finally in a brain state
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:36.860]   that lends itself well to parsing information
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:37.700]   really quickly.
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:40.100]   Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough,
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:44.380]   it's definitely, it's a more or less normal distribution.
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:46.500]   We get you stressed enough, it's hard to remember anything,
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.580]   you're not parsing time well.
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:50.180]   But in that middle range, almost every study shows
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:51.860]   that the higher levels of autonomic arousal,
[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:54.700]   meaning norepinephrine, adrenaline in your system,
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:57.540]   the more effective you are at things.
[02:27:57.540 --> 02:27:59.700]   And we always hear stress and adrenaline,
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:00.760]   it's just bad, bad, bad.
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:02.540]   But my colleague, Ali Crum at Stanford
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.220]   has done these beautiful studies where,
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:07.180]   if you just educate people on how adrenaline
[02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:11.420]   makes them sharper thinkers, they become sharper thinkers.
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:13.260]   If you educate them on the fact that stress
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:16.680]   makes your cognition worse, their cognition gets worse.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:18.300]   This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker.
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:19.740]   If you tell people they slept poorly,
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:21.360]   your recovery score sucks,
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:23.860]   they naturally perform less well the next day
[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:26.820]   than if you tell them your recovery score is high.
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:28.740]   And so I don't have anything against those companies,
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:31.460]   but I, in fact, we use some of their technology,
[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:33.000]   can be very useful in certain contexts.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.760]   But you want to determine your mindset around these things.
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.660]   And if you tell yourself, hey, deadlines make me sharp,
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:43.380]   pressure makes me sharp, you will perform better.
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:48.380]   - So stress and anxiety, what is that?
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:51.180]   And can it be leveraged for good?
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:52.620]   - Absolutely, stress and anxiety,
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:55.020]   look, whether or not you get into a cold ice bath
[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:58.060]   or a hot sauna so hot you wanna get out,
[02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:02.620]   or you get hit square in the face with something over text
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.660]   that you really didn't wanna hear or see,
[02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:07.780]   it's adrenaline, it's just adrenaline.
[02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:09.660]   And so your subjective readout of that
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:11.580]   and what it means is really important.
[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:13.040]   - And you can just channel that.
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.060]   - Well, you can.
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:17.900]   If you agree with the following statement, which I do,
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:20.060]   and many people do 'cause the data support it,
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.340]   which is Ali Crum's statement, not mine,
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:24.740]   which is she directs the MindBodyLab at Stanford.
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:26.740]   She's brilliant, by the way, brilliant,
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:28.580]   Harvard trained, Yale trained,
[02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:30.300]   trained licensed clinical psychologist,
[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:31.500]   also tenured professor at Stanford.
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:34.940]   She's a Olympian, no, excuse me,
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:39.500]   a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts.
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.340]   And her dad is a long-time martial arts trainer,
[02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:43.580]   he's done work with special forces.
[02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:45.660]   And he's an amazing human being and very humble,
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:50.300]   very kind, lovely woman and professor, scientist.
[02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:53.260]   She says, "Anything that you do and experience,
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:58.260]   "but especially stress is the consequence of that thing
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:01.060]   "and what you believe about that thing."
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:04.180]   And so if you consume a lot of information
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:06.620]   about the powers of stressful states
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:09.180]   to bring out your best, you will perform better.
[02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:10.660]   If you consume a lot of information
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:13.160]   about the power of stress to cripple you,
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.260]   you will perform worse.
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:18.500]   There's absolutely no question, the data are striking.
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:20.540]   And this is not growth mindset.
[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:22.580]   This is just simply what sorts of,
[02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:24.140]   what do you believe about stress
[02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:27.800]   based on the dominant knowledge
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:28.920]   that you're consuming about it?
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:31.660]   So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins,
[02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:34.380]   here we go again, David, or Jocko or Joe,
[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:36.100]   or someone put, or Cam Haines,
[02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:37.680]   you know, put out this information about,
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.580]   or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford
[02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:42.340]   and then now is like into the powerlifting thing and running.
[02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:45.020]   You know, and there are others too, of course.
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:48.300]   When you start to consume a lot of that information,
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:49.580]   it's not just inspiring,
[02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:51.580]   it actually changes your perception
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:53.740]   of what your own stressful states mean.
[02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:56.900]   You can actually get better from stress
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:00.980]   if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows you.
[02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:02.060]   If you're in the ocean of,
[02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:03.780]   living in the ocean of knowledge,
[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.540]   I was seeing like a pool in the summer,
[02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:06.580]   you got the kiddie pool,
[02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:08.820]   the kids all peeing in it, presumably.
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:09.660]   You got the diving thing,
[02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:10.620]   you got the high dive and all that.
[02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:13.100]   If you believe that the experience
[02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:14.740]   of belly flopping off the high dive
[02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:17.060]   is gonna make you a better diver,
[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:20.640]   in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will.
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:21.980]   Whereas if you feel that it's just
[02:31:21.980 --> 02:31:23.640]   the most embarrassing thing ever,
[02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:25.500]   and it's gonna cripple your ability
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:28.780]   to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again,
[02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:31.180]   well, you're right about that too.
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:34.220]   - Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression,
[02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:38.840]   all those kinds of things that there could be these,
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:41.600]   what are commonly seen as negative journeys,
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:46.040]   that could be, when reframed, can be used.
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:47.780]   - You know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship
[02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:50.180]   so much is that you bring this Russian thing,
[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:52.180]   you know, which I don't really understand it
[02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:53.940]   at a deep level, how could I, I'm not Russian,
[02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:58.660]   but this mindset like that there's pain in life.
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:02.220]   When I watched that "Hedgehog in the Fog" cartoon,
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:05.100]   I thought, no wonder Russians go the way they do.
[02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:06.820]   This is the most, it's so sad,
[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:08.780]   it's beautiful and sad, but it's so sad.
[02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:11.100]   Whereas out here, it's like Sesame Street.
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.940]   And my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street
[02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:15.000]   when I was a kid.
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.060]   She thought it was too chaotic.
[02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:18.320]   - Too chaotic. - Too chaotic.
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:19.580]   She was like, "It's too chaotic."
[02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:20.540]   - Too many things going on.
[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.180]   - Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed,
[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.260]   and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:25.420]   I never really liked shows.
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:28.340]   I liked doing things outside in the yard.
[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:30.700]   I was trying to trap all the animals.
[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:32.100]   I didn't want to watch stuff on TV.
[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:34.560]   But, you know, "Hedgehog in the Fog" is enough
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:38.880]   to turn any kid into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet.
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.260]   Here we go.
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.260]   I fell in love with this when you showed,
[02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:44.540]   look, it even walks with its arms behind its back.
[02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:45.780]   - So for people who don't know,
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.820]   and we're watching little clips here to get into,
[02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:53.820]   and it's a hedgehog that is wandering about
[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:56.580]   in this fog at night.
[02:32:56.580 --> 02:32:59.340]   - Can't even see a lamp.
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:00.900]   The fog is so dense.
[02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.500]   - There's a feeling of searching.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:08.140]   And then there's a horse that speaks from a distance,
[02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:09.080]   words of wisdom.
[02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:12.580]   Some people actually told me that they believe that's God.
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:15.020]   That's supposed to represent God.
[02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:18.240]   I always thought it was a motherly voice or a voice.
[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:23.160]   A voice of conformity that wants you to return to safety.
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:27.120]   And here's the hedgehog is searching
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:31.000]   for something that's in him for the unknown,
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.800]   to explore the unknown.
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:37.800]   And ultimately, as the cartoon unrolls,
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:43.440]   he discovers a friend in a bear.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:46.120]   And he also discovers a lifetime passion
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:47.800]   for looking up at the stars
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:50.760]   and the curiosity of exploring what is up there.
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:55.440]   And I see that as science, as exploring the mystery.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.040]   And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:01.840]   given all the uncertainty all around you.
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.480]   But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it,
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.060]   the feel of it, the look of it.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:12.080]   It just captures both the melancholy
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:14.620]   and the wonder of childhood,
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:17.680]   which is like there's a loneliness to it.
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:19.720]   Like nobody understands me.
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:25.720]   That's there that children can feel
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.120]   'cause you're trying to figure out--
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.560]   - That's my favorite character right there.
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:29.560]   I love the owl.
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.960]   I love the owl.
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.240]   The owl shows up every once in a while.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:33.080]   I love the owl.
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:35.160]   Sorry, I interrupted you.
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.000]   Again.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.040]   - There's non-sequitur.
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.520]   It means you're interested 70% of the time.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.720]   The other 30%, you're just an asshole.
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:43.120]   So you have to figure out which--
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:44.040]   - So I'm told.
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:47.240]   - There's non-sequitur parts in this cartoon.
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:49.920]   It's voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:52.640]   Short little films, documentary filmmakers.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:56.400]   It is, in the Soviet Union,
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:01.200]   in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:07.080]   there's channels to communicate difficult ideas to people
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.440]   and you figure out those channels.
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.840]   And in the Soviet Union,
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:13.440]   one of those channels was children's cartoons.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.320]   So you're actually there very much for adults.
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:19.600]   - Yeah, I like that in some countries,
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:21.000]   not so much in the US,
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.400]   children are treated with more respect
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:25.960]   for their intelligence,
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:29.840]   and not constantly getting this drivel
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:34.040]   of just kind of moronic explosions and whistles and bells
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:37.280]   and the voices that just kind of,
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.680]   children, obviously, are children and need to be,
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:41.200]   their brains are young and plastic
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.240]   and need to be treated and nurtured as such.
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:48.600]   But they have an intelligence.
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:51.600]   And I think that you treat them like morons
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.840]   and they're gonna behave like morons.
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.560]   You treat them as people who can consume information
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:00.680]   and make sense of it in their own way.
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:02.560]   And that's what they're gonna do.
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:05.280]   - They have a seriousness of looking at the world.
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:09.440]   I love people that talk with children like they're adults.
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.640]   Here's if you're talking to a mini Einstein,
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:15.960]   because you're like really,
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.880]   they're asking some big questions.
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:19.880]   And I think, I mean, people sometimes
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:23.240]   speak of me in this way,
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.200]   like how dumb is this childlike person?
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:28.280]   But like, no, there's intelligence
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.280]   in these dumb, simple questions,
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:32.320]   in like that a child asks.
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.280]   And I always loved those questions,
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:39.280]   the simplicity, but also the depth of those questions.
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.920]   - The reason I started watching your podcast
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:45.400]   was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio.
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.880]   And the first, maybe the first,
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:50.000]   but a question that you definitely asked him
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.320]   was you just said, what is money?
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:54.720]   And his answer was fantastic.
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.800]   It's a superb question and he gave a superb answer.
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:02.480]   And I never would have thought to ask that question.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:04.160]   But it's the question.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:06.520]   And it was the question to tee things off with.
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:10.840]   So simple questions that get right
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.960]   to the heart of the matter.
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:17.160]   And kids aren't often putting the same cultural filters.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.440]   Kids generally aren't concerned
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:23.680]   about getting canceled either.
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:25.160]   So they'll ask the question
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.400]   that no one else is willing to ask.
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:27.240]   - And they're not concerned
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:30.640]   about how dumb the question sounds.
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.160]   I find the most fascinating questions
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.920]   is just really, really simple.
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:36.200]   And it is a bit embarrassing
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.480]   to ask those simple questions of what is anything.
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:43.800]   You're asking them for all of us, so please ask them.
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:46.800]   I think that question, what is money, is crucial.
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:48.880]   And I think the simple questions
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:51.120]   are obviously the most interesting.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.520]   - I'd ask you about, you had awesome podcasts.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:54.600]   I mean, I can ask you questions
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:55.840]   about basically all your podcasts.
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.480]   People should definitely listen to "The Human Lab,"
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.960]   but with Andy Gap and the conversation,
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.680]   you talked about strength and muscle building
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:03.600]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:05.400]   - He's an encyclopedia.
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:08.440]   And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.720]   And he has a lab that includes a gym.
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.520]   And so he works on endurance and powerlifting
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.360]   and also hypertrophy training, et cetera.
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.120]   But he also does muscle biopsy.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.320]   So he runs the full spectrum.
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:23.800]   And he's a full tenured professor.
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:25.680]   And he does all this stuff.
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:29.080]   So he's a really unique person
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:31.120]   in this whole fitness landscape.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.000]   'Cause there are a lot of PTs out there.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.480]   There are a lot of kinesiologists.
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:36.640]   There are a lot of people studying nutrition
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:37.480]   and sports training.
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:40.280]   And I think he has the, among the people out there,
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:42.720]   he's at least in the top five,
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:45.160]   probably within the top three of people
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.880]   that really have their arms around the full extent
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:50.600]   of what's possible with training.
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:53.440]   And he works with the UFC Performance Center.
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:55.640]   - Well, I mean, he's just at a very systematic way
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:57.760]   of describing things that was really nice.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.080]   Skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy.
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:05.400]   So muscle mass, right?
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:06.640]   Endurance, all kinds of.
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:08.920]   And then the philosophical of like adaptation,
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.000]   of how to overload stuff, all that very,
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.640]   is there stuff, I'll ask you about Ace Bath and sauna,
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.640]   which was surprising to me there.
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.220]   Is there stuff you took away from that conversation,
[02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:25.920]   like principles about how to get strong,
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:28.040]   how to build muscle mass,
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:31.280]   that like broadened and deepened your understanding
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.360]   of that task?
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.200]   - Definitely.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:34.280]   And I'll do these in bullet points.
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.120]   'Cause if people want the logic behind them
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.960]   and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode.
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:39.200]   - It's a really good episode.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.800]   - I'll start with heat and cold really quickly
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.040]   and just say that avoid cold immersion.
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:47.800]   So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck,
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:50.180]   uncomfortably cold, within the four hours
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:53.800]   after a training session that's designed
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.280]   to evoke an adaptation, either endurance,
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:57.500]   hypertrophy or strength.
[02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:59.920]   Because the inflammation that you experience
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:02.400]   from a hard endurance workout, or from a hard strength
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:04.200]   or a hard hypertrophy workout,
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:07.200]   is the stimulus that you're going to adapt to.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:10.120]   The cold water immersion reduces inflammation
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:12.880]   and can short circuit some of that.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:14.560]   After four hours, you're probably okay,
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.240]   but if you can do it a different day
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:18.800]   or you can do it before those sessions, that's better.
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:21.880]   Heat, however, can be done immediately after training.
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:23.520]   And it's probably beneficial because of the way
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:25.240]   that it dilates the vascular system
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:28.800]   and delivers, perfuses the muscles and ligaments, et cetera,
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:29.760]   with more nutrients.
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:30.960]   - And I should just mention,
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:33.480]   that was a crucial piece of information.
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:34.840]   It's a little bit surprising.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:36.040]   Was it surprising to you?
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:36.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:39.060]   'Cause I actually, the way I posed the question to him
[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:41.680]   about cold was, I hear that getting into an ice bath
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:43.240]   or a cold water immersion after training
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:44.160]   can reduce hypertrophy,
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:45.680]   but I'm guessing it's not that big of a deal.
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:47.080]   And he said, no, it is a big deal.
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:48.860]   It will short circuit your progress.
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:51.400]   Now, for people that are only interested in performance,
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.200]   who are doing a lot of workouts and trying to recover,
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:54.720]   but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:57.640]   or build endurance, then it makes sense to do cold.
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:58.760]   - Like skill development or something.
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:01.920]   - Skill development, or you're an athlete in season.
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:04.040]   So you have to, what's so great about Andy
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:06.840]   is he really points out the specific ways to train
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:08.080]   given your specific goals.
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:09.440]   - So for getting swole,
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.040]   stay out of the ice bath after a workout.
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:12.880]   There you go.
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:14.560]   - Lex is always making fun of the meatheads.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:15.620]   I love it.
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:17.000]   I put myself in the meathead category
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.320]   only because I don't do a real sport now.
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:21.440]   I work out and I run, which is-
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:24.000]   - I'm an aspiring meathead, okay, so.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.680]   - One of these days, I'm gonna get back to Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.160]   or I'm gonna get to Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:28.320]   Now, in terms of training,
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.680]   he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.960]   Pick three exercises, compound exercises,
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.640]   multi-joint movements, do them for,
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:40.440]   do three to five exercises
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:45.240]   for three to five repetitions per set,
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:46.980]   rest three to five minutes,
[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:48.980]   and do that three to five times per week.
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:51.040]   And for details, you can, again, look to the episode.
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:51.860]   It's timestamped.
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:54.040]   But what's interesting about this is three to five times
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:55.360]   a week is a lot for a muscle group.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:58.040]   Squatting five times a week for five reps,
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.240]   meaning you're working pretty heavy,
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:01.480]   meaning you're close to failure,
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:03.620]   but not failure for strength generally.
[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:08.740]   What Andy taught me is that people who are training
[02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:13.280]   mostly for strength can do these low rep type regimens
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:16.640]   frequently because most of the adaptation is neural.
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.440]   And because you're not pushing to failure in most cases,
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:21.800]   you don't get that sore.
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.820]   And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:29.840]   to contract more intensely or with more efficiency
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:32.320]   in other ways that's leading to these strength gains.
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:34.600]   And this is why power lifters can train every day
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.280]   or five days a week or four days a week.
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.000]   For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.240]   that the repetition range can be pretty broad.
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:47.820]   You're thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions.
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:52.280]   You should do 10 sets per muscle group per week,
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:53.600]   maybe even a bit more.
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:54.480]   - So high volume.
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:59.480]   - High volume, but you have to go to failure or beyond
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:01.380]   in order to stimulate growth.
[02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:03.760]   Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:06.240]   Well, there apparently are three ways
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:08.480]   that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:11.380]   One is tissue micro damage to the tissue.
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:14.640]   The other is through some sort of tension based changes
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:17.400]   in the molecular gene programs of cells
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:19.080]   that lead to protein synthesis
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:21.040]   that are distinct from damage.
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.560]   And the other are metabolic effects
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.960]   of like high repetition work of superfusion
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:26.020]   of the muscle with blood.
[02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:27.700]   We know that third category exists
[02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:29.960]   because people are now doing this blood restriction training
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.160]   where they cuff off a muscle
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:32.640]   and they'll use a really lightweight.
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:33.480]   I've done these before.
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:35.500]   You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.220]   and you are in pain
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:38.600]   and the muscles are swelling up with blood.
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:40.360]   It does lead to hypertrophy,
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:42.940]   but in general, you're not sore.
[02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:44.680]   You're not doing tissue damage.
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:46.680]   And by the way, don't just turn the kid off a muscle
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.780]   'cause you have to use the proper cuffs
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:50.760]   because you need the blood still to flow in one direction.
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:51.980]   You can't just cinch it off
[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:55.320]   or you'll potentially kill yourself if you get a clot
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:56.840]   or you do it wrong.
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:59.480]   So get the appropriate cuffs, they're out there.
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:01.620]   And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.
[02:44:01.620 --> 02:44:02.920]   So I work out basically,
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.320]   I go to the gym every other day on average,
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:07.520]   three or four days a week I do that,
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.200]   but generally not two days in a row.
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.200]   It's workout, next day I'll do cardio, next day.
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.200]   And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog,
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:15.540]   kind of zone two cardio.
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:18.800]   Andy informed me that to build endurance
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:22.200]   while building strength and maintaining some muscle size
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:23.640]   or even building muscle size,
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.000]   I would be wise to take one day a week
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:32.000]   and add to that all out max heart rate work
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.560]   for 90 seconds at least.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.120]   So do 90 seconds, then rest,
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:38.760]   and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.480]   I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:44.780]   I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:47.600]   So I actually think it's done for me.
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.760]   - So there was a sprinting Dr. Huberman throw-
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:52.840]   - With three backs.
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:53.680]   - That's awesome.
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:57.760]   - I'll travel, generally I'll travel with too much stuff.
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:00.160]   - I love how you were probably running late for a flight
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:02.040]   and used that as an opportunity to explain.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:03.720]   - Well, as I was doing it, I was thinking to myself,
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:05.880]   okay, Andy, that's a 90 second sprint.
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:08.560]   'Cause I got to the security line, I finally got TSC-
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:11.360]   - But that's for better, that's for extending endurance?
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:14.560]   - That's for, yeah, it actually has some carryover effects
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.100]   on endurance if you're doing the other stuff.
[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:18.280]   And then he also said one day a week to do this workout
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:19.120]   and I haven't done it yet.
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:20.600]   Maybe we do it tomorrow, it'd be fun.
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:25.600]   Which is you run a mile, you ask yourself,
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:26.520]   how long did that take?
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:28.440]   Let's say it took eight minutes,
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:30.680]   then you walk or rest for eight minutes,
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:33.400]   then you run another mile as fast as you can,
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:34.880]   and then you rest for the equivalent period.
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:37.740]   And you do that one to three times once per week.
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:42.180]   And so as an all-around fitness program,
[02:45:42.180 --> 02:45:44.120]   you could collapse this into something where you say,
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:45.680]   okay, you're gonna work out with the weights
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:48.000]   for about an hour every other day,
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.920]   maybe take two days off every once in a while, maybe not.
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:53.480]   You're going to do six to 15 repetitions.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:56.040]   You're gonna push to failure on some of those, not all,
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.700]   because some of those are designed to build more strength.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:00.160]   You're not going to failure and heavier.
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:02.360]   Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep,
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:03.840]   and going to failure.
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:04.880]   And then on off days,
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:07.380]   you're gonna jog for 30 to 45 minutes.
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:09.180]   But for two days a week,
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:12.600]   you're either at the end of your jog or whatever,
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:15.480]   you're gonna do some all-out sprints for 90 seconds
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:17.600]   and then rest and repeat.
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.900]   And for another day, you're going to do these mile repeats.
[02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:27.120]   That's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.120]   But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that,
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:31.160]   what you end up with is
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.420]   some decent strength building protocols,
[02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:36.700]   some decent hypertrophy, some cardiovascular training
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:40.060]   that establishes the so-called A base or a so-called base.
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:42.040]   So you're not gonna get really good at anything.
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:44.040]   You're not gonna become a marathoner this way,
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.680]   an optimizing marathon.
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:47.120]   You're not gonna optimize powerlifting.
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.720]   You're not gonna optimize hypertrophy.
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:52.520]   But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time,
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.960]   they want some muscle, they want some strength,
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:54.960]   they want some endurance,
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:58.280]   and they want the capacity to sprint to the security gate
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.320]   without leaving a lung in the terminal.
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:03.140]   - So it's like functional stuff,
[02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:05.800]   like your life going up the stairs is easier,
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:07.880]   moving about, all that kind of, just regular life.
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:10.080]   - Yeah, and I should mention that cold showers
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:14.000]   after training don't seem to short circuit
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.880]   the training effect to the same extent
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:19.560]   that immersion in cold water does.
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:21.640]   And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers,
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:23.640]   even though they can provide some of the adrenaline
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.040]   for the mental effects of like,
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.460]   oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my system
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:28.220]   from a cold shower and I can remain calm,
[02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:30.080]   there's utility to that.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:32.840]   It's not going to have the same metabolic effects
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:35.080]   or other positive effects that cold water exposure
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.560]   has been shown to have.
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:38.300]   And that's unfortunate
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.120]   because most people have access to cold showers.
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:42.880]   Not everyone has access to a cold dunk or an ice dunk.
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:45.920]   But here in Austin, you have this place,
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.060]   and no, they don't pay me to say this,
[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:48.560]   but I always like going to this place
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.200]   whenever I'm in town, this place, Kuya.
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:52.600]   And they've got a sauna and a couple of ice baths.
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:53.980]   And they even have those salt tanks
[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:54.820]   that you can float on the surface.
[02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:55.960]   - They have ice baths there?
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:58.080]   - They have cold water immersion.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.280]   It's pretty cold.
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:00.640]   - Still haven't done an ice bath.
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:01.480]   - Really? - I need to, yeah.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.320]   I need to.
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:03.500]   - You're rushing, you'll probably get in
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:04.340]   and you won't even know.
[02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.160]   - Yeah, what is this?
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:06.000]   What's the big deal here?
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.480]   - Exactly, or people pay for this.
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:08.480]   (laughing)
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:10.280]   I did a post, right, of you as a baby.
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:11.120]   - Yeah.
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:14.520]   - I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:16.680]   in a bassinet in the snow.
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.760]   Because in Russia, they actually did this for a long time.
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:21.640]   They thought that it would,
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:23.580]   and indeed it does build the immune system
[02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:25.800]   to expose babies to the cold.
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:27.760]   - I still don't know where you got that photo.
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.840]   I knew you were able to find exactly the right,
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.560]   it was great.
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:32.400]   It was great research.
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:33.220]   - You didn't have a tie-on,
[02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:36.260]   but you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.
[02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:37.840]   So it's clearly nature nurture,
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:39.240]   clearly you were born with that.
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:40.280]   - What about sauna?
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:42.520]   He does say that it's good to do heat.
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.000]   - So there are three ways you can do sauna
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.040]   that I can just toss out as brief things.
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.760]   If you wanna get a really big growth hormone release
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:50.760]   for sake of metabolism, fat loss,
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:52.680]   you're training really, really hard in jujitsu
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:54.260]   and you wanna recover,
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:56.380]   you don't wanna sauna too often.
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:58.680]   Because the study that identified
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:02.360]   this massive 16-fold increase in growth hormone,
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:04.560]   they had people do this, it's crazy.
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:05.800]   They got into, okay,
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:09.480]   temperatures are 80 to 100 degrees centigrade.
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:13.560]   So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:16.960]   for five to 30 minutes is the typical ranges
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:19.260]   that people work in in these research studies.
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:22.780]   For maximum growth hormone release,
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:24.960]   don't do sauna more than once a week,
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.980]   but get into the sauna for 30 minutes,
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:29.980]   as hot as you can safely tolerate.
[02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:31.600]   So probably for you, that'll be 210,
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:34.920]   'cause I suspect you'll be on the high end of things.
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.560]   Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure,
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:40.440]   get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:41.880]   Then they had them do it again,
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:44.240]   out for five minutes, back for 30 minutes,
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.700]   out for five minutes, back for three minutes.
[02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:48.640]   They had them do two hours of sauna exposure
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:51.240]   to get that growth hormone release.
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:54.040]   Now for the reduction in likelihood
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:57.060]   of dying of a cardiovascular event, stroke or otherwise,
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:59.240]   the more often you do sauna, the better.
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:01.880]   So if you look at all-cause mortality
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:03.920]   or death due to cardiovascular events,
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:06.160]   and you look at sauna use frequencies
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.240]   using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade,
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:10.880]   one to seven times per week,
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:12.800]   basically the more often you get into the sauna
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:15.240]   for 30 minutes across the week,
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:17.920]   so 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:19.740]   Four times a week is better than two times a week,
[02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:21.400]   and two times a week is better than one.
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.200]   And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:29.180]   27, if you get into a sauna the way I just described,
[02:50:29.180 --> 02:50:31.760]   not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:33.980]   twice a week or three times per week,
[02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:36.000]   you reduce the likelihood of dying
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.960]   of a cardiovascular event by 27%.
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:41.240]   If you do it four or more times per week,
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:42.920]   you reduce the probability of dying
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:46.160]   by 50% of a cardiovascular event.
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:47.000]   And in these studies,
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.320]   they rule out other things that people are doing, smoking.
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:52.480]   They even ask them, do you live in an apartment?
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.840]   Are you in a happy relationship?
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.080]   Like they evaluate other potentially confounding variables.
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:59.200]   Now, for people that don't have access to a sauna,
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:03.020]   a hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet.
[02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.240]   And if you don't have access to that,
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:05.680]   do like the wrestlers do,
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:09.480]   which is put on two sets of sweats and a hoodie
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:12.760]   and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:14.480]   underneath all that and go for a run.
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:16.800]   But don't, please, nobody die of hyperthermia.
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:18.760]   I mean, you can die of warming up too much.
[02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:23.760]   - Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way,
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:27.200]   so is it as stressful as an ice bath, for example?
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:28.960]   - Okay, great question.
[02:51:28.960 --> 02:51:31.320]   People always ask how cold to make the ice bath
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:33.160]   or the cold water or the shower.
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.480]   You want it to be uncomfortably cold,
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:38.200]   meaning you want to feel like I really wanna get out,
[02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:39.320]   but you can safely stay in.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:42.360]   And that's gonna vary by person and experience with it.
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.520]   - Experience, yeah.
[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:45.660]   - With the sauna, it's the same thing.
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:47.600]   How hot to make it?
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:50.200]   Well, don't kill yourself, obviously.
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:51.040]   Be smart.
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:53.960]   If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be doing this anyway.
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:56.300]   But it's very clear that what you need
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:58.560]   is the release of something called dynorphin.
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:00.740]   We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.
[02:52:00.740 --> 02:52:04.280]   It binds to these mu opioid receptors in the body.
[02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:07.120]   You have dynorphin, which is the terrible feeling
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:09.420]   that you get when you're in really hot temperatures.
[02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:12.320]   It's also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:14.160]   when they are in withdrawal.
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:16.700]   You feel agitated, you wanna get out, it's really unpleasant.
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:18.480]   It's dynorphin binding to the so-called
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:20.840]   kappa opioid receptor.
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:22.300]   That's what you're trying to trigger.
[02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:24.240]   When you do that, a number of things happen.
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:27.040]   You set off heat shock proteins that go repair
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:29.640]   broken proteins and misfolded proteins.
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:32.620]   It also makes it so that later endorphin
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:34.540]   binds its receptor more strongly.
[02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:38.180]   So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat,
[02:52:38.180 --> 02:52:40.460]   you literally feel better in real life
[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:42.900]   when pleasurable events come on,
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:44.340]   when you experience them.
[02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:45.860]   In the same way, I like to say this,
[02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:48.660]   that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold shower,
[02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:53.660]   the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.
[02:52:53.660 --> 02:52:57.140]   These are huge increases and they last many hours.
[02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:00.040]   This is shown 'cause lately I've been getting
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:02.720]   a little bit of pushback on Twitter,
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:04.880]   which is an interesting place.
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:07.440]   People say, "Well, that's just in mice."
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:08.960]   No, all the studies I just referred to
[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:11.320]   are all done in humans, men and women,
[02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:12.920]   fairly broad age ranges.
[02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:15.280]   So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.120]   You wanna be uncomfortable in the heat.
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:19.440]   This is why I'm not a big fan of infrared saunas
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:22.840]   'cause they only go up to about 160, 170 degrees.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:26.040]   Infrared light and far red light of all kinds
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:27.980]   has been shown to be beneficial for wound healing,
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:29.780]   acne, skin, eyes.
[02:53:29.780 --> 02:53:31.500]   There are even guys now putting on their testicles
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:34.820]   'cause it can increase testosterone and sperm production.
[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:36.060]   - Yeah, hormone release.
[02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:37.100]   - Hormone release.
[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.020]   But in terms of the sauna,
[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:41.540]   you want that strong heat stimulus.
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:44.900]   - Yeah, and that's when you crawl up to the 200 mark
[02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:45.740]   and so on.
[02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:46.560]   - Whenever I'm in New York,
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:47.740]   and there's also one in San Francisco,
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:49.980]   although the one in San Francisco is clothing optional,
[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:50.820]   just to warn people.
[02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:52.940]   There's a place called Archimedes Banya.
[02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:54.840]   - Is there any scientific evidence
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:57.460]   that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?
[02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:01.060]   - Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.
[02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:03.020]   - Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.
[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:03.860]   I read that somewhere.
[02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:07.580]   - But I suppose it's not required for childbirth.
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:10.620]   But in all seriousness, in New York,
[02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:12.340]   I'll go to a place called Spa 88,
[02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:14.600]   and actually, Khabib's picture is on the wall.
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:15.440]   He goes there.
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:19.180]   And that one, it's clothing, they require clothing.
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:20.020]   I only just say that
[02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:21.900]   'cause it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:23.700]   if they kind of walk in there, a bunch of naked people,
[02:54:23.700 --> 02:54:25.380]   the one in San Francisco.
[02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:28.720]   If I go, I'm clothed, mostly because I run into coworkers
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:29.560]   or things like that.
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:33.560]   I'm sort of more old-fashioned in that way, I suppose.
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:36.440]   - Do you like to wear clothes around coworkers?
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.500]   Yes, very old-fashioned. - Yeah, in general.
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:40.920]   To me, it just seems like, just be aware.
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:44.400]   But nonetheless, the banyas have very hot saunas
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.160]   because they're Russian-owned.
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:48.040]   And in New York, there's one on the Lower East Side,
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:51.240]   but the Spa 88 place, they have some saunas
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:53.940]   that the moment I get into those,
[02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:55.580]   I have a hard time catching a full breath.
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:56.720]   It burns.
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:59.340]   They've got a cold dunk that's like a shock.
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:01.460]   And then they've got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:02.700]   that's a little mellower.
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:03.940]   So the nice thing about a banya
[02:55:03.940 --> 02:55:05.780]   is you can kind of find your place.
[02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:06.840]   And then they do the plaza
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:08.900]   where they take the eucalyptus leaves
[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.460]   and you can pay someone.
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:12.200]   And you basically, you cover your groin
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:15.700]   and then they beat you with the leaves.
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:17.660]   And it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.
[02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:18.820]   I've only done it once.
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:22.400]   And frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.140]   I didn't really like the experience,
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:26.600]   but I'll try and get into a sauna as often
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.400]   as I possibly can, which is once or three times per week.
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:34.880]   And I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion,
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:37.800]   but early in the day, 'cause it really wakes you up.
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:40.320]   - One of my favorite things I've listened to,
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.080]   I wish there was a video,
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:45.120]   is listening to a bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin.
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.760]   And he did a thing with Tim Ferriss,
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:49.080]   the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:50.540]   I don't know if you've ever heard it,
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:55.540]   but he forced him to do, they did the podcast in a sauna.
[02:55:55.540 --> 02:56:00.840]   And I don't think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:02.000]   - Yeah, if you're not heat adapted,
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:03.200]   it can be pretty stressful.
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.720]   - And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:09.340]   as somebody with microphones, like what is happening?
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:12.940]   But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough
[02:56:12.940 --> 02:56:15.540]   to kind of give themself over
[02:56:15.540 --> 02:56:17.260]   to whatever the hell this experience is.
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:22.260]   And I'm just so happy that Rick pushed that kind of idea
[02:56:22.260 --> 02:56:25.740]   and just let's do it.
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:27.760]   - That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:30.600]   - And we must, we must do this.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:31.640]   This has to be done.
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.760]   - A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:35.680]   would be really interesting.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.680]   Like you could call it the pressure cooker or something.
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:38.920]   - Oh, you mean like a regular podcast?
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:42.160]   - Yeah, like you have to sit with your guests in the sauna
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:43.680]   or they have to sit in the sauna.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:46.640]   - That was one of the interesting things is,
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:48.220]   it was a sad thing because I believe
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:50.240]   there's no video of that podcast,
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.760]   but you could tell there was a kind of,
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:56.720]   there was suffering, especially on Tim's part.
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:58.360]   It was like a degradation.
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:01.380]   He started over time not being able
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:05.600]   to put words together correctly, which he's very eloquent.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:10.600]   And so you could see there's like, there's a struggle.
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:12.780]   - Heat and cold pull you down from the inside.
[02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:14.160]   You have to, I mean, there's a reason why
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.960]   the screening process for make, you know, seal,
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:18.840]   they call it seal training,
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:21.320]   but it's really screening and training involves cold water
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:23.320]   is 'cause, you know, if you're in the heat too long,
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.080]   you'll die or damage tissue.
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:27.160]   In cold, you can do it quite extensively
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:30.220]   before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:33.320]   I was gonna say one thing that I sometimes enjoy
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:35.080]   seeing these social media posts
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.800]   where people will get into the ice bath
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:40.400]   and they'll look really stoic, like they're really tough,
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.960]   but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it.
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:47.360]   When you get into cold water, if you stay very still,
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.400]   you develop a thermal sheath around you
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.280]   that you're warming yourself.
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:55.760]   The really bold way is to get in
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.760]   and continue to sift your arms and legs
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:00.960]   and it ends up feeling miserably colder.
[02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:02.000]   - There's no sheath.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.600]   - 'Cause you're breaking up that thermal layer.
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:05.840]   And then when you get out,
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:07.640]   you'll notice a lot of people huddle
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:09.640]   or they'll put or they'll grab the towel.
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:10.520]   In general, that's me.
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:12.560]   I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna.
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:14.380]   But if you really wanna stimulate
[02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:16.280]   the big increases in metabolism,
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:18.080]   you stand out there and you dry off
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:20.760]   with arms extended in open air.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:23.680]   And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold,
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:25.840]   but your body is forced to activate a number
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:28.480]   of the warming programs related to metabolism.
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:31.120]   This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg,
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:32.420]   who's Scandinavian.
[02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:35.000]   She published this paper last year in Cell Reports Medicine.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.800]   And so I call this the Soberg principle,
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:40.280]   which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason,
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:41.920]   doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold,
[02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:44.160]   but if you're using cold specifically
[02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:47.840]   to stimulate an increase in metabolism, end with cold.
[02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:49.960]   That's the Soberg principle.
[02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:52.320]   - And with cold, if you're alternating,
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:55.400]   and then if you wanna do it the tough way,
[02:58:55.400 --> 02:58:56.680]   you let the shivering,
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:59.200]   so you just stand out and let the water evaporate.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:01.600]   - Yeah, I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean,
[02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:04.120]   everybody's kind of like holding themselves.
[02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:06.880]   If you really just, if you let yourself extend your limbs
[02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:07.760]   and move them around a bit,
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:09.520]   so you break up that thermal layer,
[02:59:11.080 --> 02:59:12.000]   that's the tough way to do it.
[02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:13.560]   So when I see people on social media getting in
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:16.360]   and they're like really tough and trying to look hard.
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:17.800]   - Yeah, you wanna be moving around.
[02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:22.600]   - Yeah, smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:23.800]   - Are you able to talk?
[02:59:23.800 --> 02:59:27.840]   So you suggest a podcast in the sauna.
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:28.680]   - How about this?
[02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:29.680]   I proposed this since I got choked.
[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.240]   - You wanna do the next podcast?
[02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:32.120]   - I'll get two.
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:33.960]   So the folks from The Plunge,
[02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:35.760]   maybe you could bring Lex a plunge.
[02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:37.720]   He certainly deserves one.
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:40.200]   And we can go side-by-side coffin style,
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:42.160]   or we can face one another and we can do it.
[02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:44.040]   - Well, we said we should do each other's podcast.
[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:44.880]   I mean, maybe next human lab podcast.
[02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:46.280]   - Oh, I can't wait to have you back on.
[02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:47.480]   I mean, we only scratched the surface.
[02:59:47.480 --> 02:59:49.080]   - Well, let's do at least part of the next
[02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:51.380]   human lab podcast either.
[02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:53.240]   - I have a sauna and a cold plunge, so we could do.
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:55.040]   - Yeah. - Yeah, we could do.
[02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:57.120]   We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.
[02:59:57.120 --> 02:59:59.560]   - I wonder how the recording works.
[02:59:59.560 --> 03:00:00.920]   If they record-- - A bit of an echo
[03:00:00.920 --> 03:00:04.040]   in the sauna, but I'm sure we can take out the reverb.
[03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:08.720]   - So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance.
[03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:12.360]   Very journalistic, very hardcore hitting questions
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:13.200]   that we have here in The Plunge.
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:15.120]   - Generally or a specific experience?
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:18.260]   - No, he has a certain problem he needs help with, no.
[03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:21.560]   Generally, you haven't done an episode on sex.
[03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:24.920]   - Well, we did an episode early on on sexual development.
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:25.760]   - Yes. - We've done them
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:27.680]   on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:31.280]   We touched a little bit on libido
[03:00:31.280 --> 03:00:34.900]   and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:38.400]   We did an episode on relationships, love, and desire,
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:40.740]   where we touched on libido specifically.
[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:43.080]   So just as a quick mention of something,
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:46.040]   a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:47.880]   that can disrupt sexual function.
[03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:51.720]   There are a few compounds like maka root and tonga ali
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:53.680]   and things like that, that at least in a few studies
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:55.200]   in humans have been shown to offset
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.260]   some of the sexual side effects.
[03:00:57.260 --> 03:01:01.280]   Now, in terms of sexual, and then, sorry,
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:03.400]   the episode on sexual development was about
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.340]   how the brain and body become organized in certain ways,
[03:01:06.340 --> 03:01:09.380]   how the brain becomes organized if you have X chromosomes
[03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:11.060]   or Y chromosomes or et cetera.
[03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:12.100]   - So early, early development.
[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:13.220]   - Early development mainly,
[03:01:13.220 --> 03:01:16.540]   and the effects of hormones later on that template.
[03:01:16.540 --> 03:01:20.160]   We will be doing a, I'm actually putting together
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:22.940]   a series on sexual health,
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:26.040]   everything from the menstrual cycle,
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:28.980]   which both men and women should understand, of course,
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:32.080]   understanding arousal, understanding, for instance,
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:33.180]   a lot of people don't realize this,
[03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:37.020]   but that orgasm is actually the consequence of activity
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:40.260]   in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm
[03:01:40.260 --> 03:01:42.620]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:46.700]   whereas arousal is the consequence of the activity
[03:01:46.700 --> 03:01:49.220]   of the parasympathetic, the calming aspect
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:51.340]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:52.740]   - That's counterintuitive, right?
[03:01:52.740 --> 03:01:55.060]   - It's counterintuitive, and it kind of works like a seesaw.
[03:01:55.060 --> 03:01:56.860]   I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation,
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:58.820]   then there's arousal, but the,
[03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:01.620]   and then immediately after orgasm
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:03.540]   and in male's ejaculation, what ends up happening
[03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:05.020]   is there's a rebounding
[03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:07.020]   of the parasympathetic nervous system,
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:09.900]   which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:11.380]   or falling asleep.
[03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:15.100]   So I'm going to do a short series on sexual health
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:16.980]   that will be, that will include stuff
[03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:21.860]   about sexual performance, but also some,
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:24.060]   I'm working on getting an expert guest
[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:26.840]   who can talk about some of the neurologic changes
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.380]   that happen as a consequence of sexual activity.
[03:02:30.380 --> 03:02:33.920]   And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here,
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:36.300]   David Buss, who's an evolutionary psychologist,
[03:02:36.300 --> 03:02:41.260]   talking about, we went pretty deep into some of the typical
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:44.900]   and unusual dynamics of mating relation,
[03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:46.220]   whether or not people have kids or not,
[03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:47.040]   and what impacts that.
[03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:49.620]   But we're going to do an episode on menopause, andropause.
[03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:52.500]   What's very surprising is I get a lot of questions
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:55.460]   about sexual health from the young male audience,
[03:02:55.460 --> 03:03:00.260]   which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects.
[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:03.460]   I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles,
[03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:05.660]   early on start to talk to one another
[03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:08.000]   about changes in physiology and psychology
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.640]   as a function of this 28 day cycle
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.800]   that they all experience sooner or later.
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:14.120]   Males, there's less of a conversation,
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:15.700]   and it usually arrives in code.
[03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:16.860]   People will say, "Hey, what should I take
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:18.340]   "to increase my testosterone?"
[03:03:18.340 --> 03:03:20.260]   And I'll say, "Well, maybe nothing.
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:23.620]   "What are you specifically concerned about?"
[03:03:23.620 --> 03:03:25.340]   And then over time, if you pull on those threads
[03:03:25.340 --> 03:03:28.220]   a little bit, you get your answer.
[03:03:28.220 --> 03:03:30.740]   Sometimes I'll just get a direct question.
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:33.540]   But I think that the psychology of all this,
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:36.860]   and in terms of jealousy, and in terms of notions
[03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:40.500]   of roles and relationships is very dynamic right now,
[03:03:40.500 --> 03:03:41.660]   and I'm fascinated by this.
[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.740]   So we're going to do a four episode series.
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:45.180]   - What about sexual fantasy?
[03:03:45.180 --> 03:03:48.860]   What, to get Freudian for a second,
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:52.820]   what role does sexual fantasy have in the human condition?
[03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:56.100]   - There's a book called "The Erotic Imagination."
[03:03:56.100 --> 03:03:57.300]   It's a very psychoanalytic book
[03:03:57.300 --> 03:04:01.220]   written by a psychoanalyst that talks about how,
[03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:03.180]   well, here's the uncomfortable reality.
[03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:05.260]   Freud was at least right about one thing,
[03:04:05.260 --> 03:04:09.020]   which is that the brain circuitry that you used
[03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:11.180]   to develop attachments to your caregivers,
[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:13.320]   mother and father or other caregivers,
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:16.700]   do not disappear when you hit puberty.
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:20.380]   They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:23.780]   And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:27.220]   and secure attached stems from childhood attachment patterns,
[03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:29.820]   but it carries over to romantic relationships.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:32.580]   - So that the relationship with your mother has--
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:33.420]   - And father.
[03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:36.980]   - And father has a, and probably other close people to you
[03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:41.340]   in your young age, has a secondary, tertiary,
[03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:44.420]   some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed,
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:46.180]   like what fantasies you might have, all that.
[03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:47.180]   - Oh, without question.
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:48.980]   And of course, early experiences too,
[03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:51.760]   and traumatic or positive or neutral.
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.540]   The thing that's really important to remember though
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:57.140]   in this transfer of circuitry from one role to another
[03:04:57.140 --> 03:05:00.820]   is that, and it's certainly consistent with psychoanalysis,
[03:05:00.820 --> 03:05:04.800]   that gender is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.
[03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:07.620]   So for instance, let's say you had a wonderful relationship.
[03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:10.820]   Let's say this, let's take a hypothetical person, okay?
[03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:12.180]   I'm truly not referring to myself.
[03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:15.660]   Let's take a young woman who has a wonderful relationship
[03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:18.660]   to her father and a just absolutely terrible,
[03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:21.660]   abusive relationship to her mother, just for sake of example.
[03:05:21.660 --> 03:05:26.420]   She then goes into adulthood and she is drawn
[03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:29.500]   to very abusive men, not always,
[03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:31.260]   but let's just use in this example.
[03:05:31.260 --> 03:05:34.260]   And the dynamic is exactly the same
[03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:36.100]   as the dynamic she had with her mother.
[03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:37.900]   That's actually a common occurrence,
[03:05:37.900 --> 03:05:40.580]   even though in this context, she's heterosexual,
[03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:41.980]   she's romantically attracted to men.
[03:05:41.980 --> 03:05:44.660]   What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic
[03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:47.620]   with one parent can be transferred onto a romantic dynamic,
[03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:49.580]   but it doesn't have to be, you know,
[03:05:49.580 --> 03:05:51.100]   that if it was with the mother,
[03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:53.400]   then it only has to do with relationships to women.
[03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:56.800]   So gender is interchangeable because these circuitries
[03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:00.020]   are pre-sexual, they're laid down in our brain
[03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:04.200]   before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.
[03:06:04.200 --> 03:06:06.600]   It's pre-verbal, excuse me.
[03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:09.860]   And so there are a lot of interesting examples
[03:06:09.860 --> 03:06:11.120]   and data to support this.
[03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:14.720]   The book "Attached" is a pretty interesting book
[03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:16.240]   by two psychologists.
[03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:18.120]   One I think is at Columbia University
[03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:22.080]   that talks about how childhood dynamics
[03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:25.640]   carry over to adult romantic attachment.
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:27.840]   So as you can tell, I get pretty alert
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:29.160]   in response to these questions.
[03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:32.120]   I get a lot of them relate in this domain.
[03:06:32.120 --> 03:06:33.640]   - They have a lot of impact on people
[03:06:33.640 --> 03:06:35.400]   and they're wondering about, they wanna learn.
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:37.080]   - And no one knows what other people are doing
[03:06:37.080 --> 03:06:37.920]   or what's normal.
[03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:40.120]   We kind of know deviancy, we know perversion,
[03:06:40.120 --> 03:06:43.120]   we know the extremes, we know the rules.
[03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:46.720]   Hopefully people know the rules, but you know,
[03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:49.440]   let's just be, there are a lot of people
[03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:51.680]   in the academic community,
[03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:53.680]   in particular at certain East Coast schools
[03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:57.580]   not to be named that are in open relationships.
[03:06:57.580 --> 03:06:58.880]   This is more common now.
[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:03.340]   It's not very common, but it's more common.
[03:07:03.340 --> 03:07:06.920]   And, you know, obviously that's a way of bypassing
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.540]   some of these more primitive emotions
[03:07:08.540 --> 03:07:10.200]   about jealousy, et cetera,
[03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:12.320]   and leveraging them towards
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:13.920]   maybe even ongoing relationships.
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:16.080]   I'm not passing judgment one way or the other.
[03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:18.420]   I always say four conditions have to be met
[03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:22.000]   for any discussion about sex and sexuality or sexual health.
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.040]   Age appropriate, context appropriate,
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:27.340]   consensual, and species appropriate.
[03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:30.760]   - Well, that's weird because the thing
[03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:34.160]   I'm trying to figure out is why my sexual fantasy
[03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:37.800]   is to go to furry orgies and have sex
[03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:42.800]   with others dressed as squirrels and me, other animals.
[03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:48.360]   So that could be, I'll see a therapist about that one.
[03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:51.060]   - I'm not gonna respond to that except to say
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:54.940]   that as long as those four conditions are met,
[03:07:54.940 --> 03:07:56.900]   consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate,
[03:07:56.900 --> 03:07:57.860]   species appropriate.
[03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:00.860]   - So there's a bunch of questions on Instagram.
[03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:05.260]   One of them on this topic, on relationships,
[03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:08.540]   somebody suggested to do a part three of why Lex is single.
[03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:10.700]   There's a running joke about this.
[03:08:10.700 --> 03:08:14.580]   - But I can answer it in part, right?
[03:08:14.580 --> 03:08:17.340]   Because, well, partially because you're very busy,
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:22.340]   partially because you've decided that until it's time,
[03:08:22.340 --> 03:08:26.660]   you're gonna wait until it's time, it's time, right?
[03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:28.140]   I mean, until it's time, you're waiting.
[03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:31.060]   And then, I mean, not saving yourself for marriage,
[03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:34.660]   I don't think, but in some sense, yeah,
[03:08:34.660 --> 03:08:37.700]   your future wife is out there.
[03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:39.820]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, she's being programmed.
[03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:43.060]   No, I mean, I definitely believe that.
[03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:45.140]   I mean, first of all, I just love people
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:47.060]   and I fall in love very easily with people
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:50.180]   with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.
[03:08:50.180 --> 03:08:51.420]   - And that way you're like Oliver Sacks,
[03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:53.580]   he would fall in love with minerals
[03:08:53.580 --> 03:08:56.540]   and concepts and things like that.
[03:08:56.540 --> 03:08:58.740]   - And so, like to me, this kind of,
[03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:04.020]   so relationship is more like a commitment
[03:09:04.020 --> 03:09:09.020]   to one particular kind of object of your love.
[03:09:09.020 --> 03:09:12.780]   Like it's almost like a,
[03:09:12.780 --> 03:09:14.940]   it's like a journey that you take on together
[03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:18.020]   because also the interesting thing about humans
[03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:20.900]   is they're moment by moment a different person,
[03:09:20.900 --> 03:09:23.260]   day by day, week by week, month by month,
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:24.820]   they change, they evolve.
[03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:26.700]   There's an ups and downs and stuff like that.
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:29.140]   So what you're doing is you're saying,
[03:09:29.140 --> 03:09:31.380]   well, I'm going to explore all the ways
[03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:34.460]   that this human gets morphed and changed
[03:09:34.460 --> 03:09:38.500]   and what makes them cry, what makes them excited,
[03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:43.500]   what makes them lonely, like the habits,
[03:09:44.500 --> 03:09:47.180]   like when they form certain habits,
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:49.260]   how they feel when those habits are broken,
[03:09:49.260 --> 03:09:52.740]   like the stupid minute things that make everyday life,
[03:09:52.740 --> 03:09:54.900]   you're going to be on that journey together,
[03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:56.580]   figuring that out, just the way we're trying
[03:09:56.580 --> 03:09:59.500]   to figure ourselves out when we're like optimizing
[03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:01.460]   these things about diet and health and so on,
[03:10:01.460 --> 03:10:04.380]   you're kind of doing this computation together
[03:10:04.380 --> 03:10:06.980]   because neither person really understands themselves
[03:10:06.980 --> 03:10:11.260]   at all and you're together both confused about each other
[03:10:11.260 --> 03:10:14.780]   and you get to almost like a relationship
[03:10:14.780 --> 03:10:18.340]   is a chance to understand yourself
[03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:22.580]   and to understand another person,
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:24.420]   like together, that process is some call it,
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:25.860]   it's some iterative.
[03:10:25.860 --> 03:10:27.180]   - You know the dynamics, right?
[03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:29.300]   I mean, you're merging two nervous systems.
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:30.720]   This was once described to me very well
[03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:34.300]   by an ex-girlfriend who's truly brilliant.
[03:10:34.300 --> 03:10:35.420]   She's really brilliant.
[03:10:35.420 --> 03:10:39.500]   She said, you know, there's four arrows.
[03:10:39.500 --> 03:10:41.900]   This is maybe to an engineer or like a,
[03:10:41.900 --> 03:10:42.980]   so it makes sense.
[03:10:42.980 --> 03:10:45.340]   There's how you feel towards the other person.
[03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:47.420]   There's how they feel towards you.
[03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:51.020]   But then there's an arrow that comes back to you,
[03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:54.940]   which is how you feel about how they feel.
[03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:56.700]   And then they have an arrow of how they feel
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:57.940]   about how you feel, right?
[03:10:57.940 --> 03:10:59.460]   This is why if someone else is moody
[03:10:59.460 --> 03:11:00.760]   or somebody else is upset,
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:05.020]   there's one version of ourselves where we respond to that
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:06.340]   or they respond to us.
[03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:09.600]   But there's another version where we respond to that,
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:12.660]   but it's also, there's a processing of what it means for us
[03:11:12.660 --> 03:11:15.460]   that they're behaving that way or feeling that way.
[03:11:15.460 --> 03:11:17.780]   And this again, leads us back
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:19.300]   to that early attachment circuitry
[03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:22.900]   because if a parent was stressed,
[03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:25.860]   the child's role is not to soothe the parent.
[03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:27.500]   In fact, healthy models of parenting say
[03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:29.180]   that children shouldn't actually know
[03:11:29.180 --> 03:11:30.840]   how their parents feel
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:32.860]   for like the first eight years of their life.
[03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:34.420]   They're not supposed to be in that mindset
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:35.920]   of empathizing for the parent.
[03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:37.780]   This is often not the case,
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:40.080]   but maybe the cutoff isn't exactly eight,
[03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:41.240]   but you get the idea.
[03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:44.060]   So the dynamics of a relationship are where the learning is
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:46.660]   because we learn how we react to other people reacting.
[03:11:46.660 --> 03:11:49.060]   It's not just a two arrow system.
[03:11:49.060 --> 03:11:51.140]   It's at least this four arrow thing.
[03:11:51.140 --> 03:11:54.900]   But there's also the element of nurturing, right?
[03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:57.860]   I mean, I think that going through life with somebody
[03:11:57.860 --> 03:12:00.140]   is so much better than going through it alone.
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:02.680]   And I never thought I'd make that statement.
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:05.860]   - So it wasn't always obvious to you.
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:07.340]   - No, it wasn't always obvious to me.
[03:12:07.340 --> 03:12:10.360]   I mean, I've really enjoyed wonderful relationships
[03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:12.520]   and some have been hard
[03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:14.500]   and there's certainly been a lot of growth.
[03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:18.560]   I'm on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:21.960]   and close with some enough that I know their spouses
[03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:23.660]   and I'm close with their families.
[03:12:23.660 --> 03:12:25.740]   But no, it wasn't.
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:29.680]   And I think that when people say relationship is hard,
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:32.960]   the only really hard part of a good relationship
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:34.340]   is just dealing with oneself
[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:36.900]   and making sure that you're staying in that mode
[03:12:36.900 --> 03:12:37.980]   of caretaking.
[03:12:37.980 --> 03:12:40.800]   'Cause I do believe that if one is mainly focused
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:42.700]   on taking good care of the other person,
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:46.400]   provided they're also focused on taking good care of you,
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:49.040]   to some extent, and we're good at taking care of ourselves,
[03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:51.040]   everybody flourishes, everything gets better.
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:52.940]   But no, I don't think I experienced that
[03:12:52.940 --> 03:12:54.860]   until fairly recently.
[03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:58.380]   - What do you think is the secret
[03:12:58.380 --> 03:12:59.940]   to a successful relationship?
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:07.380]   - There isn't just one, but at least in the top five
[03:13:07.380 --> 03:13:12.380]   is master or at least be good at autonomic self-regulation.
[03:13:12.380 --> 03:13:18.700]   Know how to calm yourself down.
[03:13:18.700 --> 03:13:21.700]   Don't expect the, like looking to anything external
[03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:24.500]   to soothe yourself, it puts you in a terrible position
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:27.700]   to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right?
[03:13:27.700 --> 03:13:29.200]   So learn how to self-soothe, right?
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:32.460]   Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions,
[03:13:32.460 --> 03:13:33.500]   steady your voice.
[03:13:33.500 --> 03:13:34.420]   There are tools to do that.
[03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:35.900]   We talk about on the podcast, but elsewhere,
[03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:36.900]   have that in place.
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:41.900]   I also think that if your main focus is on,
[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:43.860]   you wanna have good boundaries, et cetera,
[03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:46.420]   but on tending to the relationship,
[03:13:46.420 --> 03:13:48.540]   doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do,
[03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:50.740]   if everyone does that, it goes great.
[03:13:50.740 --> 03:13:52.880]   I mean, I'm sometimes so positively struck
[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:55.100]   by how supported I feel,
[03:13:55.100 --> 03:13:58.500]   because for many years I was just kind of doing
[03:13:58.500 --> 03:13:59.620]   everything on my own.
[03:13:59.620 --> 03:14:01.180]   So any little thing, I'm like, oh my goodness,
[03:14:01.180 --> 03:14:02.140]   this feels huge.
[03:14:02.780 --> 03:14:04.720]   And also I think the dynamics have to be right.
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:05.860]   Let's be really honest.
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:07.500]   This is a little bit of a tricky topic,
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:12.500]   but there is a power dynamic in relationships.
[03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:16.400]   Sometimes, not all, but in some relationships,
[03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:18.500]   it works much better if one person leads
[03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:21.100]   and the other person follows.
[03:14:21.100 --> 03:14:24.820]   In other relationships, it's more mutuality, works best.
[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.880]   People need to know what they need.
[03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:29.380]   And so knowing what you need and what you crave
[03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:30.260]   is really important.
[03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:32.400]   And then once you do that, you can create
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:33.400]   the relationship you want.
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:36.400]   I've seen that over and over again, and people are different.
[03:14:36.400 --> 03:14:42.220]   But I think that ultimately, I mean, right,
[03:14:42.220 --> 03:14:44.740]   there's the dopamine phase of a relationship,
[03:14:44.740 --> 03:14:46.140]   and then there's the serotonin phase,
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:49.020]   the kind of more mutuality, coziness, and sweetness.
[03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:52.220]   There's a great book about how to make sure
[03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:56.460]   that the dopamine component and the serotonin component,
[03:14:56.460 --> 03:14:58.540]   so to speak, go on forever.
[03:14:58.540 --> 03:14:59.820]   And it has to do with, you know,
[03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:01.420]   when you first meet someone and you're attracted to them,
[03:15:01.420 --> 03:15:04.500]   you're essentially objectifying them,
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:07.120]   meaning, but not in the way people might think,
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:09.500]   you are not dependent on them
[03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:11.680]   for emotional stability or survival.
[03:15:11.680 --> 03:15:12.880]   As you get close to somebody,
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:14.820]   you really come to depend on them,
[03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:16.500]   and then you tend to objectify them less.
[03:15:16.500 --> 03:15:18.820]   And so this book, the book is, the name is kind of corny,
[03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:20.280]   but it's written by an analyst, again.
[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:21.620]   It's called "Can Love Last?"
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:26.260]   And it's a book about how really good, strong relationships
[03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:28.580]   are the consequence of people constantly moving
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:33.280]   through this dependency objectification dynamic.
[03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:35.860]   And I use those words in the true,
[03:15:35.860 --> 03:15:37.060]   in the psychological sense,
[03:15:37.060 --> 03:15:39.100]   not in the way they're typically thrown around nowadays.
[03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:41.940]   So the idea, you know, in some cultures,
[03:15:41.940 --> 03:15:45.020]   men and women will only touch
[03:15:45.020 --> 03:15:46.900]   for two weeks out of the month.
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:48.560]   And then for the other two weeks,
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:52.540]   the excitement and the sensuality and all,
[03:15:52.540 --> 03:15:54.660]   and the sexuality is very heightened.
[03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:56.460]   And then they go back to this kind of distancing.
[03:15:56.460 --> 03:15:58.660]   Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people,
[03:15:58.660 --> 03:16:00.220]   but if you look statistically,
[03:16:00.220 --> 03:16:02.900]   those relationships tend to last a very long time
[03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:05.940]   with at least reported mutual feelings
[03:16:05.940 --> 03:16:10.500]   of intense attraction for many, many, many decades.
[03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:14.660]   So human beings need to learn how to at least understand
[03:16:14.660 --> 03:16:16.060]   and control these dynamics.
[03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:17.860]   And there's a lot of divorce, there's a lot of cheating,
[03:16:17.860 --> 03:16:18.860]   there's a lot of stuff out there.
[03:16:18.860 --> 03:16:20.900]   It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:23.000]   inside of the relationship, in my opinion.
[03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:26.900]   - Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction,
[03:16:26.900 --> 03:16:32.900]   there's actually one of the poems
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:36.020]   that Karl Deisseroth introduced me to,
[03:16:36.020 --> 03:16:38.340]   I think it's Two English Poems is the name.
[03:16:38.340 --> 03:16:41.940]   But one of the things I find myself,
[03:16:41.940 --> 03:16:45.900]   for prolonged periods, being attracted to,
[03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:50.660]   is like you notice some kind of magic,
[03:16:50.660 --> 03:16:53.660]   and you keep wanting to dig to the depths.
[03:16:53.660 --> 03:16:56.740]   Like of that magic, I'm trying to figure it out.
[03:16:56.740 --> 03:16:57.820]   - You need to really know that person.
[03:16:57.820 --> 03:17:00.380]   - To really know a person deeply, yeah.
[03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:03.420]   You notice something early on.
[03:17:03.420 --> 03:17:04.500]   I don't know what that is,
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:06.660]   but you just notice something special,
[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:09.100]   and you wanna keep pulling at that thread,
[03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:10.640]   and you never really do.
[03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:12.020]   - Well, you also have to be careful.
[03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:13.620]   I get a lot of questions from guys.
[03:17:13.620 --> 03:17:15.060]   You have to be careful of the questions you ask
[03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:16.420]   in a relationship too.
[03:17:16.420 --> 03:17:18.420]   You have to make sure you really want that information.
[03:17:18.420 --> 03:17:20.100]   And it's not just about people's past, right?
[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:21.780]   If you ask somebody how they really feel
[03:17:21.780 --> 03:17:24.660]   about something about you, and they tell you,
[03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:27.900]   that may be soothing, it may be intensely stressful.
[03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:31.220]   You have to be, here's one thing I know for sure.
[03:17:31.220 --> 03:17:34.000]   For a relationship to work, you have to be brave.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:37.480]   You can't go in there fully protected,
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:39.660]   and yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries
[03:17:39.660 --> 03:17:42.240]   because you'll end up beat up.
[03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:43.260]   What's that quote?
[03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:45.160]   If you wanna be a warrior, prepare to get hurt.
[03:17:45.160 --> 03:17:47.260]   If you wanna be an explorer, prepare to get lost.
[03:17:47.260 --> 03:17:49.420]   And if you wanna be both, you know,
[03:17:49.420 --> 03:17:52.100]   and if you become a lover, prepare to be both or something.
[03:17:52.100 --> 03:17:52.920]   Something like that.
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:55.100]   I forget what, this is one of these Instagram type things
[03:17:55.100 --> 03:17:56.900]   that you see passing by and you go, oh, that's pretty true.
[03:17:56.900 --> 03:17:59.940]   Love is scary because it takes us back
[03:17:59.940 --> 03:18:03.560]   to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive and basic
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:06.340]   as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat when we're cold,
[03:18:06.340 --> 03:18:10.060]   the desire for cold when we're overly warm.
[03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:11.940]   It's a, it's dynorphin.
[03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:14.620]   I mean, when somebody leaves, like the, you know,
[03:18:14.620 --> 03:18:17.860]   when somebody you are attached to leaves by death
[03:18:17.860 --> 03:18:20.700]   or by decision or you're forced apart,
[03:18:20.700 --> 03:18:23.180]   the dynorphin release is massive.
[03:18:23.180 --> 03:18:24.500]   It is true discomfort.
[03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:27.740]   People feel anxiety and discomfort.
[03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:30.220]   And moving through that is a hell of a process.
[03:18:30.220 --> 03:18:32.820]   I mean, if I knew how to best break up
[03:18:32.820 --> 03:18:35.500]   at a neurological level, or if you could just plug yourself
[03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:39.400]   into a wall and reset, I mean, I'd do that episode tomorrow,
[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:41.180]   but we don't have that knowledge.
[03:18:41.180 --> 03:18:42.020]   - Nah, come on.
[03:18:42.020 --> 03:18:44.100]   The, I think we've covered this before,
[03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:45.820]   and it's even been memefied.
[03:18:45.820 --> 03:18:49.580]   I think losing love is part of the magic of love.
[03:18:49.580 --> 03:18:51.500]   It means you've felt something.
[03:18:51.500 --> 03:18:52.860]   - I agree, but at some point,
[03:18:52.860 --> 03:18:55.920]   like if you've done it enough times, you know,
[03:18:55.920 --> 03:18:57.460]   life is finite, you know?
[03:18:57.460 --> 03:18:59.820]   It is beautiful to see these couples
[03:18:59.820 --> 03:19:04.820]   that seem very much in love despite many years,
[03:19:04.820 --> 03:19:06.660]   despite having been together many years.
[03:19:06.660 --> 03:19:08.380]   - Yeah, the way they look at each other.
[03:19:08.380 --> 03:19:10.220]   - Yeah, they'll say- - They still see the magic.
[03:19:10.220 --> 03:19:11.940]   - Yeah, and they'll say, "We got lucky,"
[03:19:11.940 --> 03:19:14.140]   or it was, "It's been hard," or this and that.
[03:19:14.140 --> 03:19:18.540]   I think external conditions being a little tougher
[03:19:18.540 --> 03:19:20.660]   is helpful for a couple.
[03:19:20.660 --> 03:19:21.500]   - Hardship.
[03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:24.740]   - I do, I do, because I think that you rally, you know?
[03:19:24.740 --> 03:19:26.580]   And you bond with people, you know, being,
[03:19:26.580 --> 03:19:29.180]   obviously you want to survive those conditions,
[03:19:29.180 --> 03:19:31.860]   but yeah, I do.
[03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:33.780]   I think that it- - Bonnie and Clyde.
[03:19:33.780 --> 03:19:35.740]   So any- - Well, they were a little-
[03:19:35.740 --> 03:19:37.460]   - A little too much.
[03:19:37.460 --> 03:19:38.820]   Well, a little too much.
[03:19:38.820 --> 03:19:41.100]   - They were sociopaths, but the,
[03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:41.940]   well, when two sociopaths find one-
[03:19:41.940 --> 03:19:44.100]   - Love can make you do crazy things.
[03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:45.060]   - Normally, it's interesting,
[03:19:45.060 --> 03:19:47.540]   normally sociopaths don't team up
[03:19:47.540 --> 03:19:50.060]   because they manipulate each other.
[03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:53.500]   Sociopaths, sadly, are usually only interested
[03:19:53.500 --> 03:19:56.920]   in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting,
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:01.860]   but when romantic attraction is woven in,
[03:20:01.860 --> 03:20:05.420]   then it gets really diabolical.
[03:20:05.420 --> 03:20:09.460]   - Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?
[03:20:09.460 --> 03:20:12.620]   This is why Lex is single response.
[03:20:12.620 --> 03:20:14.020]   Any advice?
[03:20:14.020 --> 03:20:15.460]   (Lex sighs)
[03:20:15.460 --> 03:20:17.340]   - Yeah, actually, this comes from a friend of mine
[03:20:17.340 --> 03:20:19.660]   who's in a really excellent marriage
[03:20:19.660 --> 03:20:23.900]   with great kids and family and high demand life.
[03:20:23.900 --> 03:20:25.620]   It's a decision.
[03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:28.580]   Like at some point you just prioritize it as,
[03:20:28.580 --> 03:20:33.340]   okay, I'm going to make this happen one way or another.
[03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:36.580]   And you don't force the discovery of that person,
[03:20:36.580 --> 03:20:38.780]   but I mean, I've occasionally said,
[03:20:38.780 --> 03:20:41.020]   hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.
[03:20:41.020 --> 03:20:45.180]   And well, it wasn't, maybe my judgment might've been off,
[03:20:45.180 --> 03:20:47.160]   but the timing wasn't right or something.
[03:20:47.160 --> 03:20:49.960]   But I think that, yeah, it's a decision.
[03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:52.140]   And it also has to do with life structure.
[03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:52.980]   I mean, there were years,
[03:20:52.980 --> 03:20:54.900]   so when I was in graduate school,
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:56.380]   I didn't want a girlfriend.
[03:20:56.380 --> 03:20:57.580]   I just wanted to be in lab.
[03:20:57.580 --> 03:21:00.620]   And sure, I had romantic dating interests,
[03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:02.500]   but I wasn't going to meet them through a committed,
[03:21:02.500 --> 03:21:04.420]   you know, live together situation.
[03:21:04.420 --> 03:21:05.700]   It wasn't where I was at.
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:07.340]   And as a postdoc, things are a little different,
[03:21:07.340 --> 03:21:08.220]   et cetera, et cetera.
[03:21:08.220 --> 03:21:09.900]   But at some point, it's sort of like,
[03:21:09.900 --> 03:21:12.460]   what do I want my daily routine to look like?
[03:21:12.460 --> 03:21:15.220]   Because ultimately a relationship,
[03:21:15.220 --> 03:21:16.260]   however one structures it,
[03:21:16.260 --> 03:21:18.120]   is going to be part of your daily routine.
[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:19.380]   So at the point where you're like, you know,
[03:21:19.380 --> 03:21:21.740]   I'd really love to wake up next to somebody
[03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:23.940]   and do blank and blank together.
[03:21:23.940 --> 03:21:26.340]   And then I'd love to work.
[03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:28.340]   And then we meet for dinner and then we, you know,
[03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:30.060]   take the dog for a walk or take kids out
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:32.940]   or whatever it happens to be, take a trip or do it.
[03:21:32.940 --> 03:21:35.700]   You have to be, one has to be in the mindset
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:38.780]   of wanting to do couple like things.
[03:21:38.780 --> 03:21:40.500]   And a lot of people don't think about it that way.
[03:21:40.500 --> 03:21:43.220]   They either fall into something
[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:48.220]   or they don't see the benefits of coupling up.
[03:21:48.220 --> 03:21:52.220]   I think that the pandemic tuned people's awareness
[03:21:52.220 --> 03:21:56.980]   to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own.
[03:21:56.980 --> 03:21:59.680]   It depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:21:59.680 --> 03:22:04.680]   But a lot of things are made better done with other people.
[03:22:04.680 --> 03:22:06.700]   - 100%.
[03:22:06.700 --> 03:22:10.560]   But I also, so I was very deliberately,
[03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:13.300]   it's an interesting way to put it,
[03:22:13.300 --> 03:22:15.420]   but what do you want your day to look like?
[03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:17.220]   I think what do you want your day to look like?
[03:22:17.220 --> 03:22:18.700]   What do you want your life to be?
[03:22:18.700 --> 03:22:23.020]   I was very deliberately always, first of all,
[03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:27.300]   happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.
[03:22:27.300 --> 03:22:31.180]   I know a lot of friends were just unable to be alone.
[03:22:31.180 --> 03:22:32.820]   I'm able to be alone,
[03:22:32.820 --> 03:22:35.740]   but I'm much happier with another person.
[03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:39.580]   Like I'm able to share joy with other humans.
[03:22:39.580 --> 03:22:40.900]   - I look forward to the day
[03:22:40.900 --> 03:22:43.460]   that our kids are rolling jujitsu
[03:22:43.460 --> 03:22:47.060]   and my kids are hanging out with your kids.
[03:22:47.060 --> 03:22:52.060]   And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting
[03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:56.140]   and fun, then it's sort of like you kind of backpedal
[03:22:56.140 --> 03:22:57.700]   from that and you go, "Well, what has to happen?"
[03:22:57.700 --> 03:22:58.540]   - How do you get there?
[03:22:58.540 --> 03:22:59.380]   - How do you get there?
[03:22:59.380 --> 03:23:02.680]   - Reverse engineer and think from first principles
[03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:03.900]   about love.
[03:23:03.900 --> 03:23:06.940]   - Andrew, thank you for being my friend.
[03:23:06.940 --> 03:23:08.500]   Thank you for being an amazing human being
[03:23:08.500 --> 03:23:11.620]   who's so inspiring to so many people for constantly.
[03:23:11.620 --> 03:23:12.820]   I told this to Carl,
[03:23:12.820 --> 03:23:17.420]   one of the things that was really refreshing about you
[03:23:17.420 --> 03:23:22.980]   is that when I tell you an idea
[03:23:22.980 --> 03:23:25.580]   and I tell you a thought, when I tell you something,
[03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:29.100]   you don't shut it down as a first step.
[03:23:29.100 --> 03:23:31.300]   I was saying that that's common in scientific community,
[03:23:31.300 --> 03:23:32.900]   that's common in people around you.
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:34.700]   You're seeing what's the goal there.
[03:23:34.700 --> 03:23:37.060]   You get excited, you get excited together.
[03:23:37.060 --> 03:23:40.460]   And that's how you can really have a great friendship
[03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:43.500]   and create great stuff together.
[03:23:43.500 --> 03:23:45.300]   So I'm deeply grateful for that.
[03:23:45.300 --> 03:23:50.180]   And just for connecting so many interesting people together.
[03:23:50.180 --> 03:23:51.780]   You're doing an amazing job, man.
[03:23:51.780 --> 03:23:53.700]   And thank you for existing.
[03:23:53.700 --> 03:23:54.900]   Thank you for being you.
[03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:56.260]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:23:56.260 --> 03:23:58.620]   And next time I'll see you in the sauna.
[03:23:58.620 --> 03:23:59.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:00.280]   - As Beth.
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:01.180]   - Well, I wanna say several things.
[03:24:01.180 --> 03:24:03.060]   First of all, thank you for having me on again.
[03:24:03.060 --> 03:24:04.540]   It's an honor and a pleasure.
[03:24:04.540 --> 03:24:07.660]   And I don't say that formally, I really truly mean it.
[03:24:07.660 --> 03:24:10.140]   I only, the Huberman Lab podcast, as I always say,
[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:12.660]   only exists 'cause you gave me the suggestion.
[03:24:12.660 --> 03:24:14.940]   And I'm so grateful that you did.
[03:24:14.940 --> 03:24:15.980]   So thank you.
[03:24:15.980 --> 03:24:17.900]   And for doing what you do.
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:20.780]   Like you are brave and you're a first man in
[03:24:20.780 --> 03:24:22.060]   and you're just continue to do it.
[03:24:22.060 --> 03:24:24.740]   Just what, as my postdoc advisor used to say,
[03:24:24.740 --> 03:24:27.460]   whatever you're doing, just keep going.
[03:24:27.460 --> 03:24:28.900]   And then in terms of our friendship,
[03:24:28.900 --> 03:24:32.980]   I mean, I think you know, and if you don't,
[03:24:32.980 --> 03:24:34.300]   I'm gonna just keep telling you anyway,
[03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:37.260]   by texting in person, you're an amazing friend.
[03:24:37.260 --> 03:24:40.540]   There's deep trust, there's immense respect.
[03:24:40.540 --> 03:24:42.900]   And I love you, brother.
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:44.480]   - I love you too, man.
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:46.060]   We did it.
[03:24:46.060 --> 03:24:47.460]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:48.720]   with Andrew Huberman.
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:50.020]   To support this podcast,
[03:24:50.020 --> 03:24:52.580]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:54.380]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:24:54.380 --> 03:24:56.980]   from Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[03:24:56.980 --> 03:24:59.600]   It is one of the blessings of old friends.
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:02.460]   You can afford to be stupid with them.
[03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:06.620]   I look forward to doing just that in the many years to come
[03:25:06.620 --> 03:25:09.660]   of friendship and fun conversations with Andrew.
[03:25:09.660 --> 03:25:12.820]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:25:12.820 --> 03:25:15.400]   (upbeat music)
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:17.980]   (upbeat music)
[03:25:17.980 --> 03:25:27.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
