[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.400]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Walker
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.180]   as our guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.120]   Dr. Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.680]   at the University of California, Berkeley.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.480]   There, his laboratory studies sleep.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.800]   They study why we sleep, what occurs during sleep,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.840]   such as dreams and why we dream, learning during sleep,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.280]   as well as the consequences of getting insufficient
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.140]   or poor quality sleep on waking states.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.760]   Dr. Walker is also the author
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.320]   of the international bestselling book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.300]   Our discussion today is an absolutely fascinating one
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.240]   for anyone that's interested in sleep, learning,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.080]   or human performance of any kind.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460]   Dr. Walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.820]   He also discusses naps,
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.220]   whether or not we should or should not nap,
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.800]   whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.160]   and if so, how to best do that.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.000]   We discuss behavioral protocols and interactions
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.520]   with light, temperature, supplementation, food,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.220]   exercise, sex, all the variables that can impact
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.840]   this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.280]   During my scientific career,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.100]   I've read many papers about sleep
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.620]   and attended many seminars about sleep.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.320]   Yet, my discussion with Dr. Walker today
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.680]   revealed to me more about sleep, sleep science,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.580]   and how to get better at sleeping
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.720]   than all of those papers and seminars combined.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.960]   I'm also delighted to share
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.040]   that Dr. Walker has started a podcast.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.560]   That podcast, entitled "The Matt Walker Podcast,"
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.860]   releases its first episode this month
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980]   and is going to teach all about sleep
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.760]   and how to get better at sleeping.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.260]   So be sure to check out "The Matt Walker Podcast"
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.740]   on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.220]   Before we begin, I'd like to mention that this podcast
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.100]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.260]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.380]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.060]   to the general public.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.280]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.180]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.360]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.340]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.960]   that are of the absolutely highest quality.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.220]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.360]   from Stanford, and everything about the design
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.420]   of their glasses is with performance in mind.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.320]   I've spent my career studying the visual system
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.000]   and how it works, and I can tell you that Roca glasses
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   take into account the science of the visual system,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200]   such that whether or not you're wearing them
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.460]   on a very bright day, or you walk into a shadowed area,
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.720]   or there's cloud cover,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.520]   you can still see everything with perfect clarity.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.560]   That also reflects the fact that the lenses that they use
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.280]   are of the absolute highest optical quality.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.560]   The other terrific thing about Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.380]   is that they're designed to be worn in all conditions.
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.840]   You can use them while running, while cycling.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.660]   Even if you get sweaty, they won't slip off,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.360]   and they look great.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.400]   One problem I have with a lot of so-called
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.820]   performance eyeglasses and sunglasses out there
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.000]   is that they look crazy.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.980]   They make people look like cyborgs.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.880]   Roca glasses have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   You can wear them to dinner, you can wear them at work,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.780]   and you can wear them in all sorts of sports activities.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.280]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.280]   That's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.760]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.120]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.760]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.560]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.320]   to help you better understand your body
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.200]   and reach your health goals.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.780]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.580]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.040]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.780]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.540]   And nowadays, with the advent of DNA tests,
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.860]   you can also get insight into your immediate
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.960]   and long-term health by way of understanding your DNA.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.600]   One issue with many DNA and blood tests, however,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.580]   is that you get the numbers back about metabolic factors,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.340]   hormones, genes, et cetera,
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.040]   but there's no directive as to what to do
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   with that information.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.840]   With Inside Tracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.460]   and that dashboard not only gives you your numbers,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.000]   but it gives you simple directives related to nutrition,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   supplementation, exercise, and other lifestyle factors
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.440]   that allow you to move those numbers into the ranges
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.020]   that are right for you and your health goals.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.520]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.680]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.800]   and if you do that,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.740]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.420]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.300]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.940]   that raises organic, grass-fed,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.700]   and finished certified humane meats.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.760]   I don't eat a lot of meat, I eat meat about once a day,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.980]   but when I do, I make sure that it's high quality
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.760]   and both humanely and sustainably raised.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.260]   Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.500]   and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.940]   but Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.860]   and seasonal grasses, resulting in meat
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.260]   that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.340]   And I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.700]   about how getting sufficient levels of omega-3s
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.560]   is very important for metabolic health, hormone health,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.660]   mood, essentially all aspects of one's health.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.260]   Belcampo meats have high levels of omega-3s
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.580]   because of the grasses they feed on.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.440]   The way Belcampo raises its animals
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.020]   isn't just better for our health,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.680]   it also has a positive impact on the environment.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.720]   They practice regenerative agriculture,
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   which means that their meat is climate positive
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.200]   and carbon negative, meaning it's good for you
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.380]   and it's good for the environment.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.680]   You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.400]   to be delivered to you using my code Huberman
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.320]   by going to belcampo.com/huberman.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.720]   And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.520]   I'm a big fan of their keto meatballs.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.400]   I also really like their boneless ribeyes.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.700]   I eat those pretty much once a day.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.000]   Again, that's Huberman for the code
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.760]   and it's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off your order.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.860]   And now my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.320]   Great to finally meet you in person.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.360]   - Wonderful to connect.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.900]   I mean, it's been too long,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.260]   but I suspect it would have been a shorter time
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.760]   before we'd met, lest the pandemic.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.720]   - Yeah.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.540]   - Thank you.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.380]   - No, thank you.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.400]   Yeah, I'm delighted
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.980]   that we're finally sitting down face to face.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.540]   I've been tracking your work, both in the internet sphere,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.680]   and I read your book and loved it.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   And also from the perspective of science,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.360]   you actually came to Stanford a couple of years ago
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.560]   and gave a lecture for brain mind.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.240]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.600]   - And there, of course, you talked about sleep
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   and its utility and its challenges
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   and how to conquer it, so to speak.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.820]   Let's start off very basic.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.940]   What is sleep?
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.040]   - Sleep is probably the single most effective thing
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.440]   you can do to reset your brain and body health.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   So that's a functional answer in terms of,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.920]   you know, what is sleep in terms of its benefits.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.840]   Sleep as a process, though,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.680]   is an incredibly complex physiological ballet.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.760]   And if you were to recognize or see what happens
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.800]   to your brain and your body at night during sleep,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.920]   you would be blown away.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.720]   And the paradox is that most of us,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   and I would think this too, you know,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.400]   if I wasn't a sleep scientist,
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.360]   we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.200]   and then we sort of wake up in the morning
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.560]   and we generally feel better.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.960]   And in some ways that denies the physiological
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.200]   and biological beauty of sleep.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.900]   So upstairs in your brain,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.400]   when you're going through these different stages of sleep,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.900]   the changes in brainwave activity are far more dramatic
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.160]   than those that we see when we're awake.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.920]   And we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   REM sleep is a fascinating time,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.260]   which is another stage of sleep often called dream sleep,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.480]   which is rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.600]   That stage of sleep, some parts of your brain
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   are up to 30% more active than when you're awake.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.240]   So again, it's kind of violating this idea
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.540]   that our mind is dormant
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.460]   and our body is just simply quiescent and resting.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.800]   So I would happy to just sort of double click
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.920]   on either one of those
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.600]   and also what changes in the body as well.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.560]   But it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.160]   and system.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.200]   That said though,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   I would almost push back against an evolved system
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.880]   when we think about the question of sleep
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.420]   and what sleep is.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.320]   Our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.680]   And I've actually questioned that
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.600]   and I have no way to get in a time capsule
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.820]   and go back and prove this.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.360]   But what if we started off sleeping
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.760]   and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.040]   Why do we assume that it's the other way around?
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.580]   And I think there's probably some really good evidence
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.980]   that sleep may have been the proto state,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.120]   that it was the basic fundamental living state.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.500]   And when we became awake, as it were,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.800]   we always had to return to sleep.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.320]   In some ways at that point,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.900]   sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.060]   And that's another way of describing what sleep is.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.320]   But again, I think it sort of denies
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.400]   that the active state of sleep,
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.780]   it's not a passive state of sleep either.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.820]   And then finally you can say,
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.140]   what is sleep across different species?
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.540]   And in us human beings and in all mammalian species
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.220]   and avian species as well,
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.540]   sleep is broadly separated into these two main types.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.380]   And we've got non-rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.540]   and then we've got rapid eye movement sleep on the other.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.820]   And we can speak about how they unfold across the night
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.980]   and their architecture,
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.020]   because it's not just intellectually interesting
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.580]   from the perspective of what sleep is.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.220]   It's also practically impactful for our daily lives.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.100]   And I'd love to sort of go down that route too,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.120]   but you navigate, you tell me I can-
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.580]   - Let's definitely go down that route.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.260]   So you mentioned how active the brain is
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.500]   during certain phases of sleep.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.140]   When I was coming up in science,
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.740]   REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.180]   was referred to as paradoxical sleep.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.260]   Is that still a good way to think about it?
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.140]   Paradoxical because the brain is so active
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.780]   and yet we are essentially paralyzed, correct?
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.480]   - Yeah, it really is a paradox.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.540]   And where that came from
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.100]   was simply the brainwave recordings.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.460]   That if all I'm measuring about you
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.100]   is your brainwave activity,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.980]   it's very difficult for me
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.700]   sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.460]   to figure out, are you awake or are you in REM sleep?
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.620]   Because those two patterns of brain activity
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.860]   are so close to one another,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.500]   you can't discriminate between them.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.180]   Yet the paradox is that when you are awake,
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.580]   I go in there and you're sort of sitting up,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.740]   you're clearly conscious and awake.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.220]   But yet when you go into REM sleep,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.640]   you are completely paralyzed.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.100]   And that's one of the,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.200]   I think that's part of the paradox,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.000]   but the paradox really just comes down
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   to two dramatically different conscious states.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.360]   Yet brain activity is dramatically
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.200]   more similar than different.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.900]   And the way I can figure out which of the two you are in
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.040]   is by measuring two other signals,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.860]   the activity from your eyes
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.420]   and the activity from your muscles.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.040]   So when we're awake,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.660]   we will occasionally have these blinks
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.640]   and we'll have sort of saccades.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.740]   But during REM sleep,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.300]   you have these really bizarre horizontal
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.760]   shuttling eye movements that occur.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.800]   And that's where the name comes from, rapid eye movements.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.400]   - Are they always horizontal?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.380]   - Mostly they are horizontal.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.940]   And that's one of the ways that we can differentiate them
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.900]   from other waking eye movement activity.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.840]   'Cause it's not always, it can be sometimes horizontal,
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.940]   but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plane.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.460]   But then the muscle activity is the real dead giveaway.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.520]   Just before you enter REM sleep,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.240]   your brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non-REM
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.320]   and REM are essentially played out
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.960]   and then expressed upstairs in the cortex
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.160]   and downstairs in the body.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.400]   When we go into REM sleep
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.520]   and just a few seconds before that happens,
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.960]   the brainstem sends a signal
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   all the way down the spinal cord.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.720]   And it communicates with what are called
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.960]   the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   which control of voluntary skeletal muscles.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.600]   And it's a signal of paralysis.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.520]   And when you go into dream sleep,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.480]   you are locked into a physical incarceration
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   of your own body.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   - Amazing.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.300]   - You know, why would mother nature do such a thing?
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.260]   And it's in some ways very simple.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.560]   The brain paralyzes the body
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.160]   so that the mind can dream safely.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.780]   Because think about how quickly
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.920]   we would have all been popped out of the gene pool.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.440]   You know, if I think I'm one of the best skydivers
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.620]   who can just simply fly,
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.160]   and I've had sometimes those dreams too,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.000]   and I get up on my apartment window and I leap out.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.960]   - You're done. - You're done.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.480]   So that's one of the sort of,
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.080]   that's part of the paradox of REM sleep,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   both its brain activity similarity,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.780]   despite the behavioral state being so different,
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.720]   and this bizarre lockdown of the sort of brain
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.080]   of the body itself.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.400]   Now, of course, the involuntary muscles,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.840]   thankfully, aren't paralyzed.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.440]   So you keep breathing, your heart keeps beating.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.620]   - Is this why men have erections during REM sleep
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.200]   and women have vaginal lubrication during sleep?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.400]   - That's one of the reasons.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.680]   Part of the other reason, though,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.440]   that is because of the autonomic activity.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.280]   So there is a part of our nervous system
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.080]   called the autonomic nervous system,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.660]   and it controls many of the automatic behaviors.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   And some of those are aspects of our reproductive facilities.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.780]   During REM sleep, what we later discovered
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.120]   is that you go through these bizarre,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.520]   what we call autonomic storms, which sounds dramatic,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.960]   but it actually is when you measure them.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.320]   That you'll go through periods
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.240]   where your heart rate decelerates and drops
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.120]   and your blood pressure goes down,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.040]   and then utterly randomly,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.700]   your heart rate accelerates dramatically
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.760]   and what we call the fight or flight branch
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.020]   of the autonomic nervous system
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.880]   or the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.140]   a badly named 'cause it's anything but sympathetic,
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.400]   it's very aggravating, that all of a sudden fires up
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.080]   and then it shuts down again.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.320]   And it's not in any regular way.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.520]   And it's when you get those autonomic storms,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.020]   you get very activated from a physiological perspective,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.640]   that you can have these erections
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.600]   and you have vaginal discharge, et cetera.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.920]   - But you're totally paralyzed.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.740]   - But you are still paralyzed.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.740]   There are only two voluntary muscle groups
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.280]   that are spurred from the paralysis, bizarre.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.620]   One, your extra ocular muscles,
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.780]   because if they were paralyzed,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.720]   you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye movements.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.700]   And the other that we later discovered
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.120]   was the inner ear muscle.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.200]   And we've got no good understanding
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.400]   as to why those two muscle groups
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.160]   are spurred from the paralysis.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   It may have something to do with cranial nerve,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.040]   but I don't think it's that.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.200]   I think it's perhaps something more sensory related.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.660]   Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.480]   are spurred from the paralysis
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.200]   is because if your eyeballs are left
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.540]   for long periods of time inactive,
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.840]   you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.000]   in the aqueous or vitreous humor.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.440]   And so the eyeballs have to keep moving in some way.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.680]   - The drainage systems of the anterior eye
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.520]   are made to require movement.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.360]   - Exactly.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.040]   - People with glaucoma have deficits in drainage
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.220]   through the anterior chamber.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.560]   But there I'm speculating.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.720]   I'm also speculating when I asked this,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.520]   I would imagine that there are states in waking
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   that also resemble slow wave sleep,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.100]   or rather that there are states that slow wave sleep
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.020]   also resembles waking states.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.080]   You've beautifully illustrated how REM sleep
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.240]   can mimic some of the more active brain states
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.200]   that we achieve in waking.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.960]   What sort of waking state that I might have experienced
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.400]   or experienced on a daily basis
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.520]   might look similar to slow wave sleep, non-REM sleep,
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.640]   if any?
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.720]   - It's a genius way of thinking about it.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.960]   Turns the tables, I love it.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   We almost never see anything like the true ultra slow waves
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   of deep non-REM sleep.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.200]   So we spoke about these two stages, non-REM and REM.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.000]   Non-REM is further subdivided into four separate stages,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.520]   stages one through four,
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.580]   increasing in their depth of sleep.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.960]   So stages three and four,
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.420]   that's what we typically call deep non-REM sleep,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.520]   stages one and two.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.160]   - So maybe take me through the arc of a night,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.560]   just so that, so I put my head down.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.680]   Well, for you, what time do you normally go to sleep?
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.520]   - So I'm usually sort of around about a 10.30 p.m. guy,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.040]   and usually I'll naturally wake up
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.840]   sort of a little bit before seven,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.140]   sometimes before 6.45 or seven.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.020]   I have an alarm set for 7.04 a.m.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.040]   - You heard it here, folks.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.520]   Matt Walker does use an alarm clock.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.260]   - I really, really, I'm usually--
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.940]   - He doesn't recommend it, but he does use it.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.860]   - Yeah, I usually-- - You're human after all.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.620]   - Oh, I am so human, and I've had my sleep issues,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.940]   and I'd love to speak about that too,
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.200]   but it's only just in the event that,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.780]   'cause I like to keep regularity too,
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.940]   you've got to keep those two things in balance.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.240]   And 7.04, just because, you know, why not be idiosyncratic?
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.000]   I don't know why we always set things on these hard numbers.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.840]   So, yep, so when--
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.760]   - So you go to sleep around 10.30.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.120]   So using you as an example,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.620]   because I imagine a number of people go to sleep
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.740]   at different times, but 10.30 is about when I go sleep,
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.840]   11 is for me, but, so you go to sleep at 10.30.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.000]   So for that first, let's say three hours of sleep,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.420]   what is the architecture of that sleep look like
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.300]   as compared to the last three hours of your sleep
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.140]   before morning?
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.340]   - Yeah, so I should note that that sort of 10.30 to seven,
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.100]   that's just based on my chronotype and my preferential.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.500]   It's different for different people.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.020]   I'm not suggesting that that's the perfect sweet spot
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.560]   for humanity's sleep.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.400]   It's just my--
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.460]   - But I imagine most people probably go to sleep
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.020]   somewhere between 10 and p.m. and midnight,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.300]   and most probably wake up between 5.00 a.m. and 7.00 a.m.,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.180]   or 5.30 and 7.30.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.340]   At least in, if you look at sort of first world nations,
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.760]   that's a typical sleep profile.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.100]   So when I first fall asleep,
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.900]   I'll go into the light stages of non-REM sleep,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.240]   stages one and two of non-REM,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.100]   and then I'll start to descend down
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.580]   into the deeper stages of non-REM sleep.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.420]   So after about maybe 20 minutes,
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.620]   I'm starting to head down into stage three non-REM
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.820]   and then into stage four non-REM sleep.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.820]   And as I'm starting to fall asleep,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.060]   as I've cast off from the, usually with me,
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.020]   murky waters of wakefulness,
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.080]   and I'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.780]   my heart rate starts to drop a little bit,
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.960]   and then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.380]   Normally when I'm awake, it's going up and down
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.180]   maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.900]   As I'm going into light non-REM sleep,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.140]   it will slow down to maybe 15, 20,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.820]   and then really starts to slow down,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.180]   down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles per second,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.100]   eight cycle waves per second.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.340]   Then as I'm starting to move into
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.660]   stages three and four non-REM sleep,
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.780]   several remarkable things happen.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.400]   All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.300]   Oh, and I'll come back to temperature.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.560]   I'm going to write temperature down
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.780]   'cause I always forget these things.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.800]   Now I'm solidly in the foothills of middle age.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.060]   So as I'm starting to go into those
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.280]   deeper stages of non-REM sleep,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.220]   all of a sudden, hundreds of thousands of cells
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.840]   in my cortex all decide to fire together,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.100]   and then they all go silent together.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.340]   And it's this remarkable physiological coordination
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.260]   of the likes that we just don't see
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.180]   during any other brain state.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.020]   - That's really interesting.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.140]   Having recorded from the brains of animals
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.420]   and a little bit from humans,
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.380]   I don't think I've ever seen the entire cortex
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.260]   or even entire regions of cortex light up like that.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.140]   - Yeah, it's stunning.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.460]   It's almost like this beautiful sort of mantra chant
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.460]   or this sort of, it's a slow inhale
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.020]   and then a meditative exhale, inhale, exhale.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.240]   And these waves are just enormous in their size.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.380]   - And the body is capable of movement at this time.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.220]   There is no paralysis.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.540]   - There is no paralysis, but for the most part,
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.700]   muscle tone has also dropped significantly
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.180]   at that point.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.780]   And then you will, or I will then stay there
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.140]   for about another 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   So now I'm maybe 60 or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.440]   And then I'll start to rise back up,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.100]   back up into stage two non-REM sleep.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.500]   And then after about 80 or so minutes,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.620]   I'll pop up and I'll have a short REM sleep period.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.540]   And then back down I go again,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.140]   down into non-REM, up into REM.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.060]   And you do that reliably, repeatedly,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.160]   and I will be doing that and I do do that every 90 minutes.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.880]   At least that's the average for most adults.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.180]   It's different in different species.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.580]   What changes to your question is the ratio of non-REM to REM
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.540]   within that 90 minute cycle as you move across the night.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.540]   And what I mean by this is in the first half of the night,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.180]   the majority of those 90 minute cycles
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.820]   are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.220]   That's when I get my stage three and four
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.940]   of deep non-REM sleep.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.860]   Once I push through to the second half of the night,
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.500]   now that seesaw balance changes.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.700]   And instead, the majority of those 90 minute cycles
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.160]   are comprised either of this lighter form
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.740]   of non-REM sleep, stage two non-REM sleep,
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.440]   and much more and increasingly more
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.940]   rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.220]   And the implication that I was sort of speaking about
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.260]   pragmatically is let's say that
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.280]   I have to, and I usually never do early morning flights
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.760]   or red eyes just because I'm a mess if that happens.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.500]   I'm not suggesting that other people shouldn't.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.140]   - I'm suggesting people not do that.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.420]   Every time I've taken a red eye or I've done that,
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.480]   two or three days later,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.200]   I get some sort of general feeling of malaise.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.800]   My brain doesn't work as well.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.460]   I think red eyes should be abolished for the pilots too.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.300]   I mean, and for the emergency room,
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.900]   I mean, long shifts have been shown to lead to
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.120]   physician-induced errors that lead to a lot of fatalities.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.700]   I mean, there are a lot of reasons why staying up too long
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.780]   or being up at the wrong times,
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.300]   if you're not adapted to it, is just terrible.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   - The data in all of those cases,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.780]   and particularly physicians too,
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.860]   there was some recent data looking at suicidality.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.620]   And the rates of suicide in training physicians
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.460]   are far, far above the norm.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.140]   And I don't suspect that their schedules are helping them.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.500]   I suspect that sleep is a missing part
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.620]   of that explanatory equation.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.620]   - I teach medical students and they're phenomenal,
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.140]   but yeah, they're under extremely challenged conditions.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.860]   - We shouldn't put them under those conditions.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.060]   - No, it's not optimizing performance.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.360]   I have one-- - But sorry, I was, sorry.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.840]   - No, no, this is important, it's an important digression.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.100]   I have one question,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.660]   which is you're saying that as across the night,
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.700]   a greater percentage of these 90-minute cycles
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.580]   are going to be occupied by REM sleep
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.620]   as you progress through the night.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.780]   I'm aware that based on work that you've done
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.300]   and from your public education efforts and others,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:25.020]   that we have so-called circadian forces
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.500]   and we have other forces that are driving
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.440]   when we sleep and when we want to sleep, et cetera,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.200]   without going into the details of those.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.140]   I have a simple question.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.520]   The experiment is the following.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.460]   Let's say, God forbid,
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.900]   you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.920]   and you stay up for the four hours or five hours
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.060]   that normally you would be
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.840]   in predominantly slow-wave sleep.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.800]   - Yep.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.200]   - Let's say you finally get to lie down at 3 a.m.,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   a time when normally your sleep would be occupied
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   mostly by rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.460]   - Yep.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.500]   - Will you experience a greater percentage
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.800]   of rapid eye movement sleep
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.580]   because of these so-called circadian forces,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.740]   meaning that's what's appropriate for that time?
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.060]   Or will your system need to start
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.620]   at the beginning of the race that we're,
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.400]   as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep?
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   - Yep.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.180]   - If that's not clear to anybody,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.260]   basically what I'm asking is if you are forced
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.580]   to skip the slow-wave sleep part of the night,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.700]   will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.400]   or does it have to start at the beginning
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.820]   and get slow-wave sleep first?
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.820]   In other words, does one sleep state
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.440]   drive the entry to the next sleep state?
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.340]   - Great question.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.580]   So there is some degree of reciprocity
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.740]   between the sleep states, I should note,
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.420]   that when we drive one of those up,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.880]   we often, but not always, see a change in the other.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.580]   There are some pharmacologies
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.300]   that have shown an independence to that
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.580]   and we've also played around with things like temperature
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.020]   and sometimes you can nudge one
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.700]   and not seem to upset or perturb the other.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.460]   But to your, I think, lovely point,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.580]   the answer is it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter,
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:11.580]   meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.940]   and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.640]   So just because I start my sleep cycle at 3 a.m.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.780]   rather than at 10.30 p.m.,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.380]   it doesn't mean that my brain just says,
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.740]   well, I've got a program
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.140]   and I'm just going to run the program
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.660]   and the way the program runs is that we always start
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.820]   with a first couple of hours of deep sleep.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.660]   So we're just gonna begin act number one, scene one.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.900]   It doesn't do that.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.660]   Now, I will get some deep sleep to begin with
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.140]   and part of that is just because of how sleep works
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.460]   based on how long I've been awake.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.560]   Longer I'm awake,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.900]   there is a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.000]   But we actually use exactly what you just described
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.740]   as an experimental technique
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.980]   to selectively deprive people
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.540]   of one of those stages of sleep or the other.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.020]   So we will do first half of the night deprivation
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.180]   and then let you sleep the second half.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.100]   So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.840]   and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.580]   And then we switch it so you only get your first four hours,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.280]   which means you will mostly get deep non-REM sleep,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.540]   but you will get almost no REM sleep.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.100]   So in both of those groups,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.100]   they've both had four hours of sleep.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.420]   So the difference between them
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.220]   in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.740]   because they've both slept for the same amount.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.340]   It's the contribution of those different stages.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.780]   Now, we actually have more elegant methods
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.780]   for sort of selectively going in there
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.440]   and scooping out different stages of sleep.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.460]   But that's the way we used to do it old school
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.740]   was just using this timing difference.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.980]   - And who suffers more, those that lack the early phase
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.940]   and were those that lack the later phase of the night sleep?
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.780]   In other words, if I have to sleep only four hours
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.540]   for whatever reason, am I better off getting
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.000]   the early part of the night sleep
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.440]   or the second half of the night sleep?
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.120]   - Depends on what the outcome measure is.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.780]   - So that gets right to the differences
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.140]   between slow wave sleep and REM.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.840]   I was probably misinformed, but my understanding,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.580]   a very crude understanding, I should say before--
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.460]   - I very much doubt it, au contraire with someone like you.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.740]   - Which is very nice of you.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.580]   But the first part of the night,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.380]   this slow wave sleep is restorative to the musculature,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.920]   to motor learning, and that the dream content
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.420]   tends to be less emotional.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.960]   The second half of the night being more emotional dreams
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.820]   and sort of the unpairing of the emotional load
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.960]   of our previous day and other experiences.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.780]   So in other words, if I were to deprive myself of REM,
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.800]   I would be hyper emotional, maybe not as settled
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.020]   with the kind of experiences of my life.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.760]   Whereas if I had to have myself of slow wave sleep,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.280]   I would feel a more physical malaise.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.340]   Is that correct or is that far too simple?
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.680]   And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.020]   - No, I think much of that is correct.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.660]   And it's sort of that plus.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.880]   So for example, during deep non-REM sleep,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.780]   that's where we get this, it's almost a form
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.140]   of natural blood pressure medication.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.080]   And so when I take that away from you, the next day,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.680]   we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.440]   We're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.640]   blood pressure.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.020]   We also know that during deep non-REM sleep
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.980]   that there is a certain control of specific hormones.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.820]   For example, we know that the insulin regulation
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.140]   of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.220]   from a regulated blood sugar perspective
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   versus dysregulated pre-diabetic look of profile,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.420]   that's where deep sleep seems to matter.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   If we selectively deprive you of that,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.900]   we can see-- - Growth hormone.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.620]   - Growth hormone is different actually.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.480]   So that's a beautiful demonstration
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.100]   where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.120]   And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.860]   And there was some really impressive frightening data
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.780]   on alcohol and its disruption of sleep.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.680]   But then we also know testosterone.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.180]   Peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.720]   - So the second half of the night.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.460]   - Which is the second half of the night.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.460]   So it really just means that your profile of mental
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.200]   and physical dysfunction will be different
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.480]   under both of those conditions.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.900]   Which one would you prefer?
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.440]   I would prefer neither of them.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   And it really depends on what you're trying to optimize for.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.080]   So it's just so complete.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.320]   Sleep is just so plory potent.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.980]   It's so physiologically systemic
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.840]   that it's almost impossible not to undergo
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.360]   one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.680]   or just REM sleep deprivation and not show a profile
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.560]   that you would really prefer to avoid.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.580]   And that's the reason from an evolutionary standpoint
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.040]   that we have preserved those stages of sleep.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.200]   I mean, sleep is just so idiotic
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.980]   from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.560]   - Or maybe waking is idiotic.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.100]   - Or waking is, well, yeah.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.000]   - Based on your previous idea.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.840]   - Who have you been talking to?
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.340]   I think that comment is very specific to me.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.180]   Yeah, I am normally always an idiot
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.180]   when waking, but I think this idea that sleep
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.540]   is so profoundly detrimental to us.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.720]   If you were to take it at face value,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.220]   you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.560]   you're not foraging for food,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.160]   you're not caring for your young.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.280]   And worst of all, you're vulnerable to predation.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.080]   On any one of those grounds,
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.000]   sleep probably should have been selected against.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.840]   But it wasn't.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.040]   Sleep has fought its way through heroically.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   Every step along the evolutionary path.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   And therefore, every sleep stage has also survived
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.220]   as best we can tell.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   What that means is that those are non-negotiable.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.220]   If mother nature had found a way to even just sort of,
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.240]   you know, thin slice some of that sleep from us,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.880]   there would have been vast, I'm sure, evolutionary benefits.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.920]   But it looks as though she hasn't.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.860]   And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.360]   after 3.6 million years, so.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.480]   - Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.760]   I want to introduce another Gedanken experiment,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.940]   another thought experiment.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.640]   So in this arc of the night,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.700]   slow-wave sleep predominates early in the night
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.460]   and then REM sleep.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.960]   There's a scenario that many people,
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.680]   including myself, experience on a regular basis,
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.400]   which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine,
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.720]   three, four hours into it, they wake up.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.400]   They wake up for whatever reason.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   Maybe there was a noise, maybe the temperature isn't right.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.140]   We will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, et cetera.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.460]   They get up, they go to the restroom.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.200]   They might flip on the lights, they might not.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.640]   They'll get back in bed.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.500]   Hopefully they're not picking up their phone
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.800]   and starting to browse and wake up the brain
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.920]   through various mechanisms,
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.400]   light and cognitive stimulation, et cetera.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.960]   They go back to sleep.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.680]   Let's say after about 10, 15 minutes,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.480]   they're able to fall back asleep,
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.860]   and then they sleep till their more typical wake time.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.120]   - Yeah.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   - How detrimental is that wake up episode or event
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.000]   in terms of longevity, learning, et cetera?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.800]   I would love to sleep the entire night through every night,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.760]   but most nights I don't.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.000]   And yet I feel pretty good throughout the day.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.640]   Some days better than others.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.800]   So if you were to kind of evaluate that waking episode
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.420]   and compare it to sleeping the whole night through,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.520]   what are your thoughts on that?
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.540]   - So I think if you're waking up sort of frequently
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.180]   as you're describing,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.320]   I would probably get your estate in order
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.820]   because my guess is within the next year,
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.520]   you're gonna be done for, no, I'm kidding you.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.820]   Absolutely kidding you.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.700]   It is perfectly natural and normal,
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.560]   particularly as we progress with age.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.240]   Children tend to have typically more continuous sleep.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.360]   Now it's not that they aren't waking up
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.500]   for brief periods of time.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.800]   They are, and in fact, we all do.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   When we come out the other end of our sleep cycle,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   at the end of our REM sleep period of the 90 minute cycle,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.600]   almost everybody wakes up and we make a postural movement.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.760]   We turn over because we've been paralyzed for so long
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.880]   and the body will also like to shift.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.920]   - Do we ever look around?
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.520]   Do we ever open our eyes and look around?
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.560]   - Sometimes people will open their eyes,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.160]   but usually it's only for a brief period of time
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.940]   and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.180]   - Right.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.060]   - Your situation, and it's my situation as well,
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.660]   I usually now at this stage of life,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.000]   I don't sleep through the night,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.860]   I'll usually have a bathroom break,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.820]   and then I'll come back.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.660]   That's perfectly normal.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.600]   We tend to forget that in sleep science,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.780]   we think of sleep efficiency.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.540]   So of the total amount of time that you're in bed,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.320]   how much of that percent time is spent asleep?
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.180]   And we usually look to numbers that are above 85% or more
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.180]   as a healthy sleep efficiency.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.780]   So if you were to think about me going to bed
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.540]   and I spend, let's say eight and a quarter,
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.080]   eight and a half hours of time in bed
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.460]   with a normal healthy sleep efficiency,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.860]   I still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.620]   hours or seven and three quarter hours,
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.180]   meaning that I'm going to be awake in total,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.700]   not in one long bout,
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.980]   but I'm going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes,
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.460]   net some time.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.960]   Sometimes that can be after a 10 minute,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.920]   dalliance after having gone to the bathroom
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.980]   and I'm just gradually drifting back off again.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.460]   Other times it will just be for a couple of minutes
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.680]   and most of those you don't commit.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.520]   So I think we need to stop.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.380]   We don't need to get too worried about, you know,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.960]   periods of time awake,
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.620]   just because we're not sleeping throughout the night.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.680]   I would love to do that too.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.480]   And I remember when I, that used to happen
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.560]   and it still happens occasionally.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   - It feels great when it does happen.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   - It's a lovely thing.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   - It's a surprise, right?
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.240]   - It is now a surprise.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.280]   - I slept through the whole night.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.820]   - Yeah, it is a surprise.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   But for the most part,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.060]   I think we can be more relaxed about that.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.020]   Where we have to be a bit more attentive though,
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.220]   is if you are spending long periods of time,
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.940]   not being able to get back to sleep.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.300]   And usually we define that by saying,
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.900]   if it's been 20, 25 minutes,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.760]   normally that's a time when we would really say,
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.380]   okay, let's explore this.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.220]   What's going on?
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.920]   Let's see what's happening.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.700]   The other thing is if it's happening very frequently.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.620]   So even if you're, you know,
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.620]   not awake for 25 minute stretches,
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.620]   but you're finding yourself waking up
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.700]   and being consciously aware that you've woken up
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.140]   for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night,
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.960]   and your sleep is very what we call fragmented.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.160]   The great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.780]   has been yes, quantity is important,
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.100]   but quality is just as important.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.760]   And you can't have one without the other
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.660]   in terms of a good beneficial next day outcome.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.220]   You can't just get four hours of sleep,
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.660]   but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired,
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.340]   nor can you get eight hours of sleep,
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.780]   but have very poor quality of sleep
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.620]   and be unimpaired the next day.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.900]   So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk this idea of,
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.020]   let's not get too worried about waking up
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.320]   and having some time awake.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.960]   That's perfectly normal and natural.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.860]   But if it's happening very frequently throughout the night,
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.500]   all those periods of time,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.680]   a long stretches of time, upwards of 25 minutes,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.100]   then let's look into it.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.380]   - Well, I can assure you just helped a lot of people
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.580]   feel better about this waking up episode
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.800]   that I and many other people experience.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.280]   - I hope so because I think it's really important that we,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:19.000]   I think I've been desperately guilty of perhaps,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.040]   early on being too puritanical about sleep.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.200]   I've retrospected and I've tried to explore
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.760]   why this was the case.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.320]   It was almost sleep or else dot, dot, dot.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.640]   And at the time when I was starting to write the book,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.560]   which was back in 2016,
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.140]   sleep was still a neglected step sister
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.240]   in the health conversation of today.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.580]   And I could see all of the-- - That has certainly changed.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.140]   - And it's changing and not because of my efforts,
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.420]   but because of all of my colleagues.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.900]   - I would say, well, it's great that you give attribution
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.780]   to your other people involved in it.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.060]   Of course, it's a big field,
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.460]   but I think you've done a great service
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.380]   by cuing people to the importance of this state,
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.740]   not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.200]   but also for optimizing their waking state.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.180]   It's really, I view sleep as this period that feels good,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.500]   but we're not aware of how it feels
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.780]   when we're in it necessarily.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.140]   It has tremendous benefits when you're doing it well,
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.120]   so to speak, and it has tremendous deficits when we're not.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.440]   And I think it was an important thing for you to do
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.880]   to cue people to this issue.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.780]   And I would say mission accomplished,
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.760]   that people are aware of the need for sleep.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.520]   I think that knowing that waking up
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.680]   in the middle of the night is normal,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.240]   provided it's not too frequent, is great,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.840]   and will also help people
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.260]   who may have been overly concerned about that.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.040]   I do want to use this as an opportunity
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.400]   to raise something about the so-called Uberman schedule,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.920]   not to be confused with the Huberman schedule.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.320]   Fortunately, no one has confused those yet.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.720]   Some years ago, there was a discussion
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.960]   about the so-called Uberman schedule,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.560]   meaning the Superman schedule.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.320]   So that's Huberman without an H,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.920]   which I have nothing to do with.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.640]   If you read your Nietzsche, this will have a subtext.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.160]   But regardless, the Uberman schedule, as I understand,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.280]   is one in which the person elects to sleep
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.440]   in 90-minute bouts spread throughout the day and night
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.440]   in an attempt to get more productivity
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.760]   and/or reduce their overall sleep need.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.480]   There was a paper published recently
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.020]   that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.520]   Maybe you just give us the take-home message on that.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.680]   - Yeah, so these Uberman-like schedules,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.240]   and there's lots of different forms of that,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   they tried to essentially pie chart the 24-hour period
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.700]   into short bouts of sleep with some shorter,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   well, slightly longer periods of wakefulness,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.960]   then short bouts of sleep, then wakefulness.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.800]   I sort of made it, I think, a quip.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.120]   It's almost like you're sleeping like a baby,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.840]   'cause that's the way that babies will sleep,
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.280]   that they will have these brief naps, then they're awake,
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   then they're asleep, then they're awake,
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.120]   and to the chagrin of parents across the night,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.640]   it's basically the same.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.800]   They're awake, they're asleep, they're awake, they're asleep.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.920]   And that's more the schedule that these types
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.640]   of protocols have suggested.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.760]   And there was a really great comprehensive review
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.640]   that found not only that they weren't necessarily helpful,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.280]   but they were actually really quite detrimental.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.880]   And on almost every performance metric,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.600]   whether it be task performance,
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.320]   whether it be physiological outcome measures,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.040]   whether it even be the quality of the sleep
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.820]   that they were having when they were trying to get it,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.880]   all of those were in a downward direction.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.120]   And it's not surprising.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.320]   If you look at the way that your physiology is programmed,
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.440]   if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed,
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.360]   none of that screams to us
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.160]   that we should be sleeping in that way.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.000]   - Well, I'm chuckling,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.920]   because we always hear sleep like a baby.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.460]   This is how babies sleep.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.620]   And I would say, don't sleep like a baby,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.680]   sleep like an adult, be an adult.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.960]   Get your solid eight hours.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.840]   - It's Billy Crystal's line,
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.260]   he was a long standing suffering insomniac.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.580]   He says, I sleep like a baby, I'm awake every 20 minutes.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.520]   And I think this is another one of those demonstrations
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.260]   that when you fight biology, you normally lose.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.860]   And the way you know you've lost
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.580]   is disease, sickness and impairment.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.940]   And I think if you sleep in accordance
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.580]   with the natural biological edict
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.260]   that we've all been given,
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.160]   life tends to be both of a higher quality
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.760]   and a longer duration.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.680]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.920]   Along those lines, as a vision scientist,
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.380]   I've been very excited by the work
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.480]   on these non-image forming cells in the eye,
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.800]   the so-called melanopsin cells
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.420]   that inform the brain about circadian time of day.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:01.080]   And I'm a big proponent of people getting some sunlight,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.440]   ideally sunlight, but other forms of bright light
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.880]   into their eyes early in the day
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.760]   and when they want to be awake.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.020]   Essentially during the phase of their 24 hour
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.400]   circadian cycle when temperature is rising
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.620]   and then starting to get less light in their eyes
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.680]   as our temperature is going down
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.540]   later in the day and in the evening.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.360]   Are there any adjustments to that general theme
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.900]   that you'd like to add or is in any way?
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.340]   - No, I think that's exactly what we recommend right now,
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.900]   which is try to get at least 30 to 40 minutes of exposure
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.620]   to some kind of natural daylight.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.700]   Now, there may be parts of the world where, you know-
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.380]   - Yeah, you're from a rather cloudy part of the world.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.700]   - I am from, yeah, Liverpool, England
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.820]   and the Northwest of England is not known
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.620]   for its beach resorts and fine weather.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.700]   I remember I sort of, I went back home for a trip
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.380]   when I'd first been out in California
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.300]   and I thought, why is the sky so low?
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.900]   You know, it's just, you know, constantly out.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.940]   We joke that in the UK,
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.660]   we usually have nine months of bad weather
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.460]   and then three months of winter
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.420]   and then that's your entire year in terms of a climate.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.780]   But to come to your point, you're exactly right.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.000]   Try to get that daylight.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.480]   Now, it can be, you know, working next to a window
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.520]   and you're getting that natural sunlight,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.860]   but that natural sunlight is,
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.880]   even on a cloudy day in England,
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   is usually far more potent than anything that you'll get
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.300]   from indoor lighting.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.240]   Despite you thinking sort of from a perception wise,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.620]   maybe they're much closer than I would think.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.300]   - Yeah, I've been, sorry to interrupt,
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.700]   I've been a big proponent of there's an app
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.380]   called Light Meter, which will, it's a free app.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.340]   I have nothing to do with it.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.080]   They will allow you to get a pretty decent measurement
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.240]   of the amount of light energy coming toward you.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.940]   And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.280]   where you don't think it's very bright out,
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.340]   kind of a dismal day,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.860]   you'll notice that there'll be a thousand, two thousand,
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.460]   even, you know, 5,000 lux, lux just being a measure
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.420]   of brightness, of course.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.960]   And then you can point the same light meter
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.100]   toward an indoor light that seems very bright
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.260]   and very intense and it'll say 500 lux.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.980]   And you realize that the intensity as we gauge it
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.540]   perceptually is not really what the system is receiving.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.860]   So outdoor light is key.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.120]   How do you, how do you get this natural stimulation
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.020]   or I should just say light stimulation early in the day?
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.660]   What is your typical, what does Matt Walker do
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.120]   to get this light stimulation?
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.520]   - I am no poster child, but usually I will,
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   if I'm working, I usually work out most days.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.240]   And I shopped around and I found a gym
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.560]   that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the east.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.720]   This is sound, this is going to sound so ridiculous.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.320]   You know, Matt Walker chooses a gym on the basis
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.920]   of the solar input. - I love it.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.760]   - So he can, you know, correct a circadian.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.960]   - There are a lot of criteria for selecting gyms.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.720]   This one is actually grounded in physiology and biology.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.040]   - And selfishness about my own sleep.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.880]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.140]   So you get your exercise and your light stimulation
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:05.980]   simultaneously. - That's right, yep, yep.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.880]   - And so you're stacking cues for wakefulness
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.720]   early in the day.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.440]   - Exactly, so both exercise and daylight
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   are wonderful cues for circadian rhythm alignment
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.280]   and also circadian rhythm reset each day.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.040]   And so I will use both exercise.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.640]   I mean, I am, I'm neither a strong morning type
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.040]   or a strong evening type and my preference to exercise
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.100]   is probably some time in the middle of the day,
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.020]   probably somewhere around 1 p.m., sorry, not 1 a.m.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.480]   But I'm usually working out probably around
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   the sort of 7, sort of 45, 8 a.m. time.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.720]   That's usually when I'll start my workout.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.160]   And there I'll start with cardio, spin bike,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.940]   facing a window, and luckily for the most part
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.640]   here in California, there's usually sunlight coming through.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.720]   But it doesn't matter to me because just as you said,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   even when it's a cloudy day, that lux coming through
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.000]   of light, the intensity is splendid.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.840]   So I would prefer to favor my exercise
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.320]   just because for efficiency too,
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.780]   I wanna get also working on the day.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:19.520]   I'll try to match my exercise more
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.080]   with my circadian light exposure
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.320]   than I would probably if I'm going to,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.040]   do I really wanna crush a workout
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.120]   or do I want to just make sure it's a good workout?
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.920]   I would prefer to work out at a different time,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.800]   but I like that because of the daylight.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.200]   And we can speak about exercise timing at some point
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.820]   because there's a lot of discussion around that,
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.660]   when is the right time to exercise during sleep?
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.100]   And we can sort of bust some myths there too.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.040]   So I think you're spot on with the suggestion,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.260]   get some morning daylight, try to get that exposure,
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.740]   usually at least 30 to 40 minutes.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.860]   There was some great work recently coming out
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.040]   in the occupational health domain,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.580]   where they moved workers from offices
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.220]   that were just facing walls
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.680]   and didn't have any exposure to natural daylight.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.620]   And then they did a time period during that study
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.960]   where they actually were in front of a window and working.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.520]   And they measured their sleep and their sleep time
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.480]   and their sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.720]   I'm forgetting the numbers now,
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.140]   but I think the increase in total sleep time
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.760]   was well over 30 minutes.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.720]   And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.100]   And if you're batting an 80% sleep efficiency average,
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.500]   we're a bit concerned about that.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.200]   But add 10% to that, now you're in a great echelon
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.680]   of healthy sleepers.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.140]   And all you did was just spend some time
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.400]   working in front of windows.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.240]   - That's great.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.200]   And probably folks might want to consider
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.820]   spending a little less time with sunglasses
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.660]   provided they can do that safely.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.800]   Driving, et cetera.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.620]   You're not alone with your exercise behavior
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.460]   in facing east.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.760]   So the one and only Tim Ferriss told me recently
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.100]   that his morning routine nowadays consists of
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.240]   jumping rope while facing east
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.760]   to get the sunlight stimulation of the eyes.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.640]   And as Matt and I both know,
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.560]   it has to be of the eyes, right?
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   I mean, these portals are the only way
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.680]   to convey to the rest of the brain and body
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.000]   about the time of day and wakefulness.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.040]   - Along the lines of wakefulness,
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.480]   I have a number of questions about caffeine.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.720]   The dreaded and beloved caffeine.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.560]   I love caffeine, but I like it in relatively
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.540]   restricted periods of time.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.800]   So I'm a big fan of waking up
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.440]   and even though I wake up very groggy,
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.920]   allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.640]   Meaning I wake up very slowly,
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.760]   but I don't drink caffeine right away.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.200]   I sort of delay caffeine by a little while,
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.540]   usually 90 minutes to two hours.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:58.040]   And that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.640]   of how caffeine and the adenosine receptor interact.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.760]   I have a feeling you're going to pronounce
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.000]   adenosine differently than I do.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.320]   - No, no, no. I will go with adenosine.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.300]   - I'll try to go with your skeletal instead of skeletal
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.460]   and synapse and synapse.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.500]   - Schedule and schedule.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.340]   - There we go.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.580]   But to make it really simple for folks,
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.720]   how does caffeine work to make us feel more alert?
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.560]   And does the timing in which we ingest caffeine
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.940]   play an important role in whether or not it works for us
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.080]   or against us?
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.960]   So maybe we just start with how does caffeine work?
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.560]   Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.620]   which are my preferred sources of caffeine,
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.380]   do I feel a mental and physical lift?
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.160]   - Yeah. So I'm going to suggest counter
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.940]   to what most people would think, drink coffee.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.020]   - Or mate, is mate okay also?
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:51.860]   Whatever form you enjoy.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.100]   - Well, we'll come on to sort of why I suggest that,
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.060]   but when it comes to coffee,
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.900]   I would say the dose and the timing makes the poison.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.700]   So let's start with how caffeine works.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.460]   Caffeine is in a class of drugs
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.100]   that we call the psychoactive stimulants.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.540]   So it works through a variety of mechanisms.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.380]   One is a dopamine mechanism.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.900]   Dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical,
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.880]   or, but dopamine is also very much
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.780]   an alerting neurochemical as well.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.460]   And caffeine has some role it seems to play
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.200]   in increasing dopamine,
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.980]   but it's principal mode of action we believe
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.960]   in terms of making me more alert
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.720]   and keeping me awake throughout the day
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.260]   is on the effects of adenosine.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.700]   And to explain what adenosine is from the moment
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.900]   that you and I woke up this morning,
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:51.060]   this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.820]   And the longer that we're awake,
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.300]   the more of that adenosine accumulates.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:59.380]   - Is it, may I ask, is it accumulating in neurons,
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.140]   in glia or in the blood vessels?
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.340]   Where, and is it also accumulating in my body?
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.140]   Where is this adenosine coming from
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.260]   and where is it accumulating?
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.940]   - Yeah, so the adenosine here that we're talking about
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:12.620]   that is creating the sleep pressure
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.960]   is a central brain phenomenon,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.260]   and it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.980]   And as they're combusting energy,
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.260]   And so as we're awake throughout the day
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.340]   and our brain is metabolically very active,
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.820]   it's accumulating and building up this adenosine.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.980]   Now, the more adenosine that we have,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.180]   the sleepier that we will feel.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.680]   So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.500]   Now, it's not a mechanical pressure.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.000]   Don't worry, your head's not going to explode.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.460]   It's a chemical pressure.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.780]   And it's this weight of sleepiness
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.860]   that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.220]   - May I just interrupt you again to just ask,
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.020]   do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that?
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.660]   I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole,
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.680]   but for the aficionados and for myself,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.320]   we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.120]   that release things that our brain areas,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.620]   locus coeruleus just being a brain area, of course,
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.220]   that release things that proactively create wakefulness.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.640]   So are those neurons shutting down as a consequence
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.980]   of having too much adenosine?
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.600]   Or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.200]   that are becoming activated?
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.760]   Because these, you can imagine both things
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.720]   working in parallel.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.140]   One or the other would accomplish the same end point.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.300]   - Yeah, and it's both.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   And so there are two main receptors for adenosine,
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.800]   the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.240]   and they have different modes of activating brain cells
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.780]   or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.660]   And adenosine works in this beautiful, elegant way
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.660]   where it will inhibit and shut down
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.480]   the wake promoting areas of the brain
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.540]   whilst also increasing and dialing up the volume
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.240]   on sleep activating,
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.000]   sleep promoting reach. - Biology is so beautiful.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.640]   - Oh, it's always a push pull.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.480]   - Yeah.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.500]   - I mean, and we could have a larger discussion
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.340]   at some point about that everything,
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.640]   seeing dark edges, seeing light edges,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.840]   our ability to smell or to sense pressure on this,
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.680]   everything's a push pull in biology.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.760]   - Oh, that's great, yeah, yep.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.240]   - So this is another example where as I am awake longer,
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.760]   adenosine is released in the brain
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.280]   and my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.800]   by that adenosine and my sleepiness brain areas,
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.100]   so to speak, are being promoted to be more active.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:41.940]   Is that correct?
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.060]   - That's right, and it's a very progressive process.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.520]   It's not like a step function where,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.020]   and sometimes that happens occasionally,
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.660]   but it's usually because you've been sort of driving through
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.500]   and as we'll come on to have caffeine in the system.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.400]   And then all of a sudden you just hit a wall
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.200]   and it just engulfs you and you go from a zero
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.160]   to the one of sleepiness within a short period of time.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.600]   - What explains the fatigue after a hard conversation?
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.800]   The desire to go to sleep
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.640]   or the desire to go to sleep during a hard conversation.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.560]   - That's an interesting one.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.960]   I think it's usually just based
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.940]   on personality type interactions and for the most part-
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.400]   - Not that I've ever experienced that before.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.760]   - No, people with you don't, but with me, they almost-
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.800]   - Oh, no, no, no, I mean, I've experienced the desire
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.520]   to some conversations, I'm halfway through them
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.120]   and I feel like I want to take a nap, right?
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.640]   - And I would love to look at people's sleep history.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.800]   We've sort of seen that time and time again,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.040]   but, and then it could be, you know, with folks like me,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.580]   people just lose the will to live
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.840]   within about five minutes of speaking with me, so.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.680]   - Not true.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.240]   They hear that sleep is important, that's all.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.200]   - Unrelated and that's flattery, that's great.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.580]   But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation,
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.040]   as I was saying, it's usually a kind of a linear process
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.600]   or maybe it's probably closer to an exponential
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.320]   in terms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.600]   And we haven't really been able to measure that in humans
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.620]   because normally we, it's hard to actually, you know,
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.360]   stick something into the brain and be, you know, sucking,
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.400]   siphoning off stuff every couple of minutes,
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.000]   as you could do in animal studies
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.800]   and keep asking people every couple of minutes,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.440]   how sleepy do you feel, how sleepy?
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.560]   And track to see if there's a linear rise in, you know,
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.140]   adenosine, which then creates an exponential rise
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.040]   in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.580]   But I'm kind of nerding out.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:32.500]   Caffeine comes into play here because caffeine,
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.320]   comes into your system and it latches onto those welcome
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.740]   sites of adenosine, the adenosine receptors.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.740]   But what it doesn't do is latch onto them and activate them
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.840]   because if it was doing that, then it would, you know,
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.640]   in lots of ways it would dial up more sort of sleepiness.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.240]   It does the opposite.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.520]   The way that caffeine works is that it comes in,
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.660]   competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine,
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.600]   competitively forces them out of the way,
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.100]   hijacks that receptor by latching onto it,
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.840]   but then just essentially blocks it.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.740]   It doesn't inactivate the receptor.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.240]   It doesn't activate the receptor.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:20.000]   It functionally inactivates it in the sense that it takes it
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.880]   out of the game for adenosine.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.400]   So it's like someone, you know, coming into a room
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.480]   and you're just about to sit down on the chair
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.320]   and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.080]   and you're like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.240]   And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.440]   from adenosine and adenosine,
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.500]   even though it's at the same concentration in your brain,
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.420]   your brain doesn't know that you've been awake for,
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.660]   you know, 10 hours, 16 hours at that point
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.040]   when you've downed a cup of coffee,
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.080]   because all of that adenosine that's still there
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.200]   can't communicate to the brain that you've been awake
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.600]   for 16 hours because-
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.120]   - But the adenosine is still in brain-
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.580]   - Correct.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.920]   - So the real question is what happens when caffeine
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.260]   is dislodged from the adenosine receptor?
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.600]   - Unfortunate things happen.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.720]   And that's what we call the caffeine crash,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.360]   which is caffeine has a half-life and it's metabolized.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.720]   - Do you recall what the half-life is?
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.400]   - Yeah, the half-life is somewhere between five to six hours
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.160]   and the quarter-life therefore is somewhere
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.180]   between 10 to 12 hours.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.280]   It's variable.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.800]   Different people have different durations of its action,
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.320]   but for the average adult, five to six hours.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.780]   That variation, we understand it's down to a liver enzyme
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.200]   or a set of liver enzymes of the class
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.300]   that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.080]   And there are, I think last I delved into the data,
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.280]   which was pretty recently,
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.000]   there are two gene variants that will dictate
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   the enzymatic speed with which the liver breaks down caffeine
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.440]   and that's why you can have some people
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.840]   who are very sensitive to caffeine
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.440]   and other people who say,
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.000]   I'm just doesn't affect me really that much at all.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.520]   - These are the people that have a double espresso
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.160]   after a 9 p.m. dinner and can sleep just fine.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.000]   - Well, and we'll come on to-
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.360]   - Or at least subjectively they think they're sleeping.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.220]   - Yeah, and we should speak about that,
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.800]   that assumptive danger too.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.320]   So then the caffeine is in the system
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.120]   and after some time period,
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.440]   it will be inactive in the system.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.200]   So let's say that I've been awake for 12 hours now
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.120]   and it's 8 p.m. and I'm feeling a bit tired,
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.340]   but I want to push through
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.980]   and I want to keep working for another couple of hours.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.600]   So I have a cup of coffee.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.660]   All of a sudden I was feeling tired,
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.780]   but I don't feel like I've been awake for 12 hours anymore
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.880]   because with the caffeine in the system,
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.560]   maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.480]   through the receptor to my brain.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.080]   100% of the adenosine is still there,
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.400]   only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.680]   So now I think, well, I haven't been awake for 12 hours,
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.360]   I've just been awake for six hours, I feel great.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.980]   Then after a few hours
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.080]   and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system,
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.220]   not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.960]   that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.280]   several hours ago,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.200]   it's that plus all of the adenosine
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.720]   that's been building up during the time
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.640]   that the caffeine has been in my system.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.520]   - So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.920]   - It is a tsunami wave, yeah, and that's the caffeine crash.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.320]   - And it's interesting because the caffeine crash
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.900]   at two o'clock in the afternoon
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.320]   when you have work to do is a terrible thing.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.920]   But what about the person,
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.160]   maybe this person is me in my 20s,
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.880]   who says I'm going to drink caffeine all day long
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.480]   and then I want the crash because at nine or 10 PM,
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.800]   if I stopped drinking caffeine at say 6 PM and I crash,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.240]   then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.640]   Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is?
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.680]   Because given the half-life of caffeine
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.440]   that you mentioned a few moments ago,
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.960]   I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.560]   circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.220]   or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.840]   that even if I get eight or who knows,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.460]   even 10 hours of sleep,
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:16.940]   it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.040]   - Yeah, and that is the danger.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.200]   Just sort of those people that you described who say,
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.800]   and a lot of them will speak with me too,
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.460]   say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.860]   and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.220]   because usually those are the two phenotypes
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.460]   that we typically see with too much caffeine.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.080]   I just can't fall asleep as easily as I want to,
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.540]   or I fall asleep but I just can't stay asleep
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.180]   and caffeine can do both of those things quite potently.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.540]   - How late in the day do you think is,
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.660]   assuming somebody, translate this folks,
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.060]   if you go to bed earlier or later,
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.700]   you have to shift the hours accordingly,
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.960]   but given somebody who typically gets into bed
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.480]   around 10, 10, 30 and falls asleep around 11, 11, 30,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.660]   when would you recommend they halt caffeine intake?
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.620]   And these are not strict prescriptives
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.860]   but I think people do benefit
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.440]   from having some fairly clear guidelines
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.980]   of what might work for them.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:15.020]   Would you say cut off caffeine by what time of the day?
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.820]   - I would usually say take your typical bedtime
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.720]   and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to eight hours
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.360]   is probably getting a little bit close,
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.220]   but take back sort of 10 hours or eight hours of time.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:31.500]   That's the time when you should really stop using caffeine
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.100]   is the suggestion.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.780]   And the reason is because for those people
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:39.440]   who even just keep drinking up until into the evening,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.520]   you're right that they can fall asleep fine,
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.360]   maybe they stay asleep, but the depth of the deep sleep
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.640]   is not as deep anymore.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.000]   And so there are two consequences.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.160]   The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%,
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.700]   and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.440]   I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.380]   or you can just do it every night to yourself
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.560]   with a couple of espressos.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.480]   The second is that you then wake up the next morning
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.720]   and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.360]   and I didn't have problems staying asleep,
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.860]   but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.680]   So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.840]   the next morning rather than just two or three cups
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.280]   of coffee, and so goes this dependency cycle
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.880]   that you then need your uppers to wake you up
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.380]   in the morning, and then sometimes people will use alcohol
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.960]   in the evening to bring them down
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.320]   because they're overly caffeinated,
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.160]   and alcohol, and we can speak about that too,
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.760]   also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.000]   So you're right that it's not just the quantity
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.320]   of your sleep or even difficulties falling
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   or staying asleep, it can also be deep sleep.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.840]   But here again, I think, I don't want
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.140]   to be frightening people, and I mentioned this before,
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.000]   I think one of the real problems or mistakes that I made,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.920]   'cause I didn't, I'd never had much public exposure
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.440]   before the book, and I was so saddened
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.980]   by the disease and the suffering that I was seeing
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.640]   as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society,
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.800]   and the fact that it wasn't really being discussed
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.980]   very much, I sort of came out a little bit headstrong,
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.920]   more than a little bit headstrong,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   and I think I was perhaps too much gas pedal
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.280]   and too little break as it were,
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.240]   and I don't think that's the right way
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.120]   to approach health message within the public sphere,
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.760]   and I've become much softer
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.380]   in how I think about these things.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.560]   I have ideas about what the ideal world looks like for sleep,
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.500]   but I also realized that none of us live
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.680]   in this thing called the ideal world.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.520]   - We certainly don't.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.260]   - So I want to be really mindful of that,
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.000]   and I think I've done a really bad job
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.840]   of being sort of too forthright,
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.560]   particularly for people who struggle with sleep.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.160]   Early on when I would offer these messages about sleep,
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.860]   I want to be veritical when it comes to the science.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.080]   I want to be faithful to the science,
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.560]   but I also don't want to go out
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.420]   and scare the living daylight out of people,
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.040]   particularly people who are struggling with their sleep,
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.560]   'cause it's probably only gonna make matters worse,
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.760]   so I've been beautifully schooled
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.960]   by learning how to be a slightly better public communicator.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.360]   I'm nowhere near of the standing that you are.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.960]   You're very elegant, and it's very intuitive to you.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.800]   I'm still with training wheels,
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.360]   but I'm getting a little bit better,
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.960]   but I just want to say that
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.160]   when I'm speaking about caffeine,
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.940]   'cause it sounds as though I'm very sort of overt about it,
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.580]   but I will come back to why I say drink coffee,
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.000]   but I just want to make that point.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.520]   - Yeah, well, I appreciate you making that point,
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.040]   and I'm sure our listeners will too.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.580]   I still will stand behind my statement,
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.440]   which is that what you've done for the notion
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.880]   that sleep is vital for all aspects of health
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.160]   and for performance, mental, and physical, and wakefulness,
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.120]   the message and the packaging it was contained in
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.300]   and has been clearly, clearly net positive.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.520]   People needed to be cued to this.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.320]   The I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality is one that I had.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.140]   It's one that other people have.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.320]   People in a huge number of vital communities,
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.460]   not just your students, but also people.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.300]   The messaging that you provided and continue to provide
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.540]   has positively impacted the first responder community,
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.520]   the medical community.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.040]   There's still steps that need to be taken,
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.060]   the military community,
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.200]   and of course the civilian community.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.380]   And so I think these adjustments about,
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.460]   yeah, caffeine's okay,
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.440]   just restrict it to the early part of the day
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.060]   if you can most days.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.620]   I mean, I think the law of averages,
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.380]   it's like the light viewing behavior.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.940]   I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural,
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.060]   some other form of bright light early in the day.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.240]   But if you miss a day,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.220]   it's not that your whole system is going to dissolve
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.540]   into a puddle of tears.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.760]   That'll happen on the second or the third day.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.600]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.420]   You got a couple of days.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.080]   Biology works in averages except with respect
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.580]   to accident or injury.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.460]   A car accident is a car accident, right?
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.200]   You don't get to have three of those
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.940]   before the brain damage occurs
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.900]   if the accident is severe enough.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.100]   But with sleep behavior,
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.580]   these homeostatic type behaviors,
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.660]   or with food, one chocolate sundae,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.500]   is it going to kill you?
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.320]   No.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.220]   Every night, yeah.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.620]   It's going to make you demented and kill you early.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.460]   We know this.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.680]   And so I think the middle ground
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.180]   is often a hard place to achieve.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.780]   So I think you've done a phenomenal job,
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.860]   but I appreciate you raising these points.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   And I think it's clear that we all need to,
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:45.020]   that we all can and should do certain things better,
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.280]   including being gentle with ourselves from time to time
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.620]   when we deviate from these ideal circumstances.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.500]   Along these lines, I do want to talk about alcohol
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.580]   because I think caffeine and alcohol represent
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.060]   the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.260]   Clearly there are other stimulants.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.500]   There are your Adderalls and your high energy drinks
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.420]   that people use.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.180]   But alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed.
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.320]   A stimulant and sedatives, depressants,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.980]   as they're sometimes called.
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:18.980]   So what happens when somebody has a glass,
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.620]   we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:27.620]   or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner,
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.820]   how does that impact their sleep?
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.900]   And then we'll be sure to circle back
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.960]   in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.940]   when it comes to avoiding alcohol
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.900]   or if it's age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.740]   - Yeah.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.980]   So alcohol, if we're thinking about classes of drugs,
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.180]   they're in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.760]   And I think one of the first problems that people
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   often mistake, alcohol is often used as a sleep aid
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.580]   for people who are struggling with sleep
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.900]   when things like over the counter remedies, et cetera,
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.540]   And alcohol unfortunately is anything but a sleep aid.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.520]   The first reason that most people use it
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.260]   is to try and help them fall asleep.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:18.020]   - And this process of this event that we call falling asleep,
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.700]   I have to imagine is a process.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.540]   - It is a process.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.500]   - Like everything in biology.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.820]   And that that process involves in some way,
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.140]   as we talked about pushable before,
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:29.580]   turning off thinking, planning, et cetera,
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.820]   and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism.
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.180]   I have to imagine that these two things
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.980]   are knobs turning in opposite directions
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:39.160]   that gives us this outcome we call falling asleep.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.940]   Alcohol, it seems is helpful for some people
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:45.260]   to turn off their thoughts or their planning.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.580]   Is that right?
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.520]   - Yes, it is.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.920]   And so I think, if we look at the pattern of brain activity,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.280]   if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.560]   where we're looking at the activity of your brain
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.160]   and watch you drifting off,
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   some parts of your brain will become less active,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.000]   other parts will become more active.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.960]   And this is the push-pull model, it's inhibition excitation.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.760]   But alcohol is quite different in that regard.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.420]   Alcohol is because it's a sedative.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.100]   What it's really doing is trying to essentially
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.760]   knock out your cortex.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.020]   It's sedating your cortex.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.160]   And sedation is not sleep.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.100]   But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening,
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.740]   when we have a couple of night caps,
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.240]   we mistake sedation for sleep saying,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.100]   well, I always, when I have a couple of whiskeys
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.440]   or a couple of cocktails,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.220]   it always helps me fall asleep faster.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.640]   In truth, what's happening is that
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.900]   you're losing consciousness quicker,
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.360]   but you're not necessarily falling
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.060]   naturalistically asleep any quicker.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.320]   So that's one of the first sort of things
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.740]   just to keep in mind.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.240]   The second thing with alcohol
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.160]   is that it fragments your sleep.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   And we spoke about the quality of your sleep
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.360]   being just as important as the quantity.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.080]   And alcohol through a variety of mechanisms,
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.320]   some of which are activation
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.160]   of that autonomic nervous system,
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.520]   that fight or flight branch of the nervous system,
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.140]   alcohol will actually have you waking up
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.220]   many more times throughout the night.
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.360]   So your sleep is far less continuous.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.800]   Now, some of those awakenings will be
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.020]   of conscious recollection the next day.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.680]   You'll just remember waking up.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.640]   Many of them won't be.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.780]   And so, but yet your sleep will be littered
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.720]   with these sort of punctured awakenings
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.560]   throughout the night.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.920]   And again, when you wake up the next morning,
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.200]   you don't feel restored by your sleep.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.080]   Fragmented sleep or non-continuous sleep
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.480]   in this alcohol induced way
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.500]   is usually not good quality sleep
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.120]   that you feel great on the next day.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.960]   The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.040]   is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep,
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.980]   your rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.500]   And REM sleep is critical
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.900]   for a variety of cognitive functions,
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.780]   some aspects of learning and memory,
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.360]   seems to be critical for aspects
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.180]   of emotional and mental health.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.240]   - You've described it before
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.840]   as a sort of self-generated therapy
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.240]   that occurs while we sleep.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   - Yeah, it's overnight therapy.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.440]   It's emotional first aid.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.780]   - Well, certainly people that don't get enough sleep
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.480]   are very easy to derail emotionally.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.100]   Not that one would want to do that to people,
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.200]   but we all sort of fall apart emotionally.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.020]   I always think of it as almost like our skin sensitivity
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:29.080]   can be heightened when we are sleep deprived.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.720]   Our emotional sensitivity
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.880]   is such that when we're sleep deprived,
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.300]   such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.320]   to create that kind of friction.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.760]   Things bother us.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.280]   - Threshold to trigger? - Even online comments
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   bother us when we're sleep deprived.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.120]   And never when we're well rested.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   - I would love to say that I never look at them,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.840]   except I look at maybe every one of them.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.000]   - Here I will editorialize,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.300]   because the notion of not looking at comments
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.780]   is unreasonable to ask of any academic,
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.520]   because academics,
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.760]   we are all trained to look at our teaching evaluations.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.520]   And just like with online comments,
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.400]   to ignore 20% of them.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.360]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   We look at them all.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.200]   In any event, so in terms of translating this to behavior,
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.360]   I'm not, I don't particularly enjoy alcohol.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.420]   I guess I might be fortunate in that sense,
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.260]   but I also have never really experienced
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.920]   the pleasure of drinking alcohol.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   I sometimes like the taste of a drink,
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.440]   but I never liked the sensation.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.360]   So that's, I don't have a lot of familiarity with this,
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.600]   but many people do, and I understand that.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   So let's say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.280]   with dinner, and they eat dinner at 7 p.m.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.800]   Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all?
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.600]   Let's just sort of, let's make this a series of gradations.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.640]   - Yeah, and the answer is yes.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.320]   I think once they just looked at a single glass of wine
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.920]   in the evening with dinner,
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.640]   and I would be untruthful if I didn't just simply say
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.360]   it has an effect, and we can measure that
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.740]   in terms of the actual-- - Less REM sleep.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.680]   - Less REM sleep, and one of the fascinating studies,
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.040]   I can't remember what dose,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.280]   I think they got them close to a standard
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.600]   illegal blood alcohol level.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.040]   So maybe they were a little bit tipsy,
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.060]   and yes, you see all of the changes that we just described.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.200]   They sort of lose consciousness more quickly.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.560]   They have fragmented sleep,
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.000]   and they have a significant reduction in REM sleep.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.160]   But what was also interesting,
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.360]   because REM sleep, as we spoke about before,
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.280]   is a time when some hormonal systems
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.760]   are essentially recharged and refreshed,
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.600]   growth hormone being one of them,
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.540]   there was well over a 50%, five-zero drop
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.600]   in their growth hormone release
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.760]   during alcohol-laced sleep at night.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.580]   - Wow, and growth hormone is so vital
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.120]   for metabolism and repair of tissues,
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.800]   and keeping body fat low. - It's not just for kids.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.940]   This is essentially adults. - It's essential, essential.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.440]   Along those lines, I just want to highlight the fact
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.040]   that this information that you're sharing,
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.640]   that growth hormone is released as strongly tethered
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.360]   to the presence of healthy amounts of REM sleep,
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.680]   is interesting to me because I always thought
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.000]   that growth hormone was released
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.440]   in the early part of the night.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   - Well, it is released across both of those,
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.720]   but across the different stages.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.440]   But what we also know is that when you disrupt REM sleep,
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.320]   there are those growth hormone consequences.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.080]   So it's not an exclusive system.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.820]   Just like with testosterone,
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.480]   we can see changes throughout non-REM sleep,
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.580]   but if you ask when are the peak release rates
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.720]   of testosterone, it's right before we go into REM sleep
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.360]   and then during REM sleep.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.500]   - And of course, testosterone being important
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.840]   both for males and for females, right?
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.460]   For libido and tissue repair and wellbeing.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.880]   Nobody, regardless of chromosomal, hormonal,
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.360]   or any other background,
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.480]   wants to have their normal levels of testosterone
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.880]   reduced acutely.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.920]   That's just a bad,
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.840]   it equates to a terrible set of psychological
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.680]   and physical symptoms.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.000]   - Yeah, and the mortality risk that's associated
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.920]   with low testosterone is non-trivial.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.760]   - Prostate cancer.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.000]   - Right, exactly.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.780]   So coming back to just the point on REM sleep
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.760]   that you mentioned regarding emotional instability,
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.520]   and we see that that's one of the things,
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.120]   one of the most reliable signatures
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.580]   of just insufficient sleep,
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.740]   it doesn't have to be sleep deprivation.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.680]   What we've discovered over the past 20 years
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.760]   here at the Sleep Center is that
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.240]   there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.400]   in which sleep is normal.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.240]   And so I think that firstly told us
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.140]   there is a very intimate association
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.700]   between your emotional mental health and your sleep health.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.940]   But when it also comes to REM sleep,
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.580]   I think what's fascinating is that
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.560]   it's not just about your emotional health.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.560]   It's not just about your hormonal health.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.760]   We've also been seeing other aspects of cognition,
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.940]   but then there was a report,
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.820]   I think it could have been about two years ago,
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.240]   out of Harvard.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.460]   I think it was Beth Clearman's group.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.400]   They found that,
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.640]   and they replicated it in two different large populations.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.240]   If you look at the contribution of different sleep stages
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.320]   to your lifespan,
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   REM sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.520]   And it was a linear relationship.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.800]   It wasn't sort of one of these U-shape or J-shaped curves
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.460]   that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.000]   It really was linear,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.420]   that the less and less REM sleep that you were getting,
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.120]   the higher and higher your probability of death.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:44.960]   And then they did--
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.920]   - Was that death due to natural causes or accident?
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.960]   'Cause I could imagine if you're not getting enough REM sleep
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.800]   you're more likely to drive off the freeway,
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.640]   step off a cliff.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.480]   - Yeah, I think it was all cause and effect.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.380]   - Or just make bad decisions about anything,
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.000]   and love relationships,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.560]   which can also be life threatening.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.160]   - Yeah, I've tried to lean into that
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.080]   and claim that with those bad relationship situations,
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.240]   oh, I just didn't have enough REM sleep last night,
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.080]   my darling.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.220]   - The REM sleep defense.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.860]   - But she's far wiser than I thought.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.760]   So they did this great machine learning analysis,
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.600]   and I may get these numbers backwards,
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   but I think for every 5% reduction in REM sleep,
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.720]   there was a 13% associated increased risk of mortality.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.980]   And I could have, I'll have to go back and check.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:36.120]   But to me, in the machine learning algorithm,
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.040]   what they ultimately spat out
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.120]   was that of all of the sleep stages,
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.360]   REM sleep is the most predictive of your longevity,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.820]   of your lifespan.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.840]   So we often, I hear people saying,
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.160]   how can I get more deep sleep?
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.840]   Or they sometimes say, how can I get more dream sleep?
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.880]   And my answer is a question.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.680]   Why do you want to get more of that?
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.920]   And they'll say, well, isn't that the good stuff?
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.800]   And I'll say, well, actually all stages of sleep.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.640]   - It's all the good stuff.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.200]   Well, it's like the exercise question.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.500]   And it took decades for people to understand
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:12.240]   that moving around at, for about 150,
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.320]   probably 180 minutes a week
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.060]   at doing endurance type work, zone two cardio type work,
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.560]   it is correlated with living longer,
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.360]   feeling better, less diabetes, et cetera.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.200]   There's really no way around it.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.200]   I mean, you can ingest metformin until the cows come home.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.140]   You can take NMN,
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:34.440]   all of which I think have their place in certain contexts.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.480]   I'm a big fan of the work surrounding all those protocols,
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   but without getting proper amounts of movement,
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.120]   meaning sufficient numbers.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.140]   So it doesn't matter how many 12 minute exercise regimes
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.960]   you follow per week, you need that threshold level.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.000]   And it sounds like the same is true of REM sleep
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.440]   and total amount of sleep.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.160]   There's just, you pay the piper somehow.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.040]   - Yeah, the return on investment, I mean, to flip the coin,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.440]   the return on investment is astronomical.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.440]   I think of sleep, it is the tide that moves,
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.920]   that raises all of those health boats.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.000]   And the most fundamental layer of mental and physical health.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.480]   Whenever people ask me, even though I'm not a physician,
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.680]   they'll ask me, what should I take or what should I do?
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.000]   The first question is always, how's your sleep?
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.720]   Meaning, how well do you sleep every night
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.240]   and how long you sleep?
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.820]   I always recommend your book.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.520]   I always recommend the podcast
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.220]   you've been a guest on, et cetera.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:36.560]   Who knows, maybe you'll even release your own podcast
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.920]   at some point soon and keep,
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.520]   because I do think people need to hear from you more often.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.600]   One thing, I don't want to return to the notion
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.040]   of public health discourse too much,
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.200]   but I do want to say one issue with books in general
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.800]   is that they can be revised,
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.200]   but it's more or less a one and done kind of thing
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.700]   until the next book comes out.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.240]   One thing that I like about the podcast format
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.360]   is that updates can be provided regularly,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.400]   corrections and updates as new data come out.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.680]   And so that's a wonderful aspect to this format
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.800]   and hopefully the format that you'll be embracing.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.360]   I think the world needs to hear more from you more often
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.480]   about sleep and its various contours, not less.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:22.480]   And so I do have a question about drinking alcohol,
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.640]   not that we want to promote day drinking,
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.040]   but let's say that the one or two glasses of wine
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.360]   or a cocktail is consumed with lunch,
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.760]   something that isn't traditionally done nowadays,
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.600]   or in a late afternoon happy hour cocktail,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.480]   and then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.740]   Do you think that that will improve
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.120]   or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.000]   Or if you have a drink,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.080]   are you basically screwed for the next 24 hours?
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:56.080]   - No, I think there's going to be a time window dependency.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.200]   Now, I don't know of anyone who's essentially done
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.400]   what you and I would like,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.720]   which is the time separation dose dependent curve
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.200]   where, okay, you drink at 10 a.m.,
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.000]   then, or 11, 12, one, two, three, four, five,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.460]   all the way up to 10 p.m.,
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.580]   and estimate what is the blast radius,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.280]   and is it linear or is it non-linear?
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:22.200]   Is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours,
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.600]   do you just hit this exponential and it's bad, bad, bad,
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.840]   or is there some other curve that we could imagine?
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.360]   There would be many possibilities.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.600]   But certainly what we know is that the less alcohol
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.680]   and the less, and more specifically the metabolic byproducts,
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.280]   aldehydes and ketones,
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.560]   they're the sort of the nefarious players here.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.480]   - And not the ketones that people are all excited about.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.180]   The other ketones, the chemists know
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.020]   what we're referring to.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.160]   - Yeah, this is not about ketogenesis.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.360]   - This is not about ketogenesis.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.960]   There are ketone bodies that are released
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:58.040]   after ingesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.160]   that a ketogenic diet might promote.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:04.200]   - Right, so I think in terms of that alcohol,
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.520]   profile, we certainly know that,
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.200]   as you're heading into the evening hours,
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.260]   once again, timing and dose make the poison.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.960]   But I think it's also important once again,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.280]   from that public message standpoint, and thank you,
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.040]   I think I am leaning into the sort of the podcast
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   consideration arena at some point,
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.720]   but I don't want to be puritanical here.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.560]   I'm just a scientist,
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.080]   and I'm not here to tell anyone how to live.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.840]   All I'm trying to do is empower people
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.660]   with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep,
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.500]   and then you can make whatever informed choices
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.340]   that you want.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.360]   Now, unlike you, it turns out I'm not a big drinker.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.720]   It's just because I've never liked the taste.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.980]   And I'm surprised that they haven't taken away
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.160]   my British passport because I don't like lager or beer.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.080]   But I also want to say that life is to be lived
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.480]   to a certain degree.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.600]   It's all about checks and balances.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   So if I go out and I have an ice cream sundae,
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.520]   I'm not big on those either, but sure,
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.340]   I know that my blood glucose is not gonna be ideal
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.160]   for another 12 hours maybe.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.440]   That's just the price you pay for having
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.820]   some kind of relaxed, fun life.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:23.960]   I don't want to look back on life and think,
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.240]   gosh, I lived until I was 111,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.320]   and it was utterly miserable.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.620]   But it's all about some kind of a balance.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.820]   My job is not to tell people a prescription for life.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.260]   It's just to offer some scientific information.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.440]   - Oh, I think you're doing a terrific job of that.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.100]   People are, I always say we have all these neural circuits,
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:50.320]   and if it's working properly, we all have a circuit
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.960]   that allows us to skip over information as we wish, right?
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.540]   If the circuits between your brain and your thumbs
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.880]   are working, you can slide right along.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.820]   You can drop to the next content however you like.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.640]   I would like to ask about marijuana and CBD.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.580]   This is a discussion that I think five years ago
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.520]   would have ventured into the realm of illegal,
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.840]   but now in many places, not all,
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.340]   medical marijuana is approved or is legal,
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:20.560]   and certainly it's in widespread use.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.160]   Certainly not recommending people do it.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.400]   I have my own thoughts about marijuana, CBD.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.480]   I've been fortunate, I suppose,
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.400]   that I don't particularly like marijuana or CBD.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.320]   I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   First of all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep,
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.140]   the architecture of sleep?
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:44.060]   And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine,
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:48.580]   does when you ingest it or when it's in your bloodstream,
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.740]   does relative to when you go to sleep,
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.260]   does that play an important role?
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.240]   So does marijuana disrupt sleep?
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.860]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.360]   And there's a pretty good amount of data on,
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.000]   so we can break sort of cannabis down
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.640]   into two of its key ingredients.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.480]   We've got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.600]   And CBD is sort of the less,
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.640]   what we think of as the non-psychoactive component.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.120]   In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.040]   If you take THC, you can get high.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.020]   That's the psychoactive part of the equation.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.380]   - Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense?
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.660]   - No, they're not.
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:36.900]   Neither of them have that class right now.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.900]   THC can, seems to speed up the time
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:44.260]   with which you fall asleep.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.140]   But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.540]   of your falling asleep with and without that THC,
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.000]   it's not going to be an ideal fit.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.460]   So you could argue it's non-natural,
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.920]   but many people use THC for that fact
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.600]   because they find it difficult to fall asleep.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.440]   And it can speed the onset of at least non-consciousness,
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.520]   I guess is the best way of describing it.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.880]   But there are problems with THC and there are twofold.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.080]   The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.920]   seems to block REM sleep.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.900]   And that's why a lot of people when they're using
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.380]   will tell me, look, I definitely, I was dreaming,
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.660]   I don't remember many of my dreams.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:28.100]   And then when they stop using THC,
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.860]   they'll say I was having just crazy, crazy dreams.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.340]   And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.460]   REM sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.980]   in this sense, it's the same homeostatic mechanism.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.620]   Some people will tell me, look,
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:46.460]   if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol,
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.780]   maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:52.100]   And I'll just have these really intense dreams.
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.800]   So, and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.740]   Well, the way it works is that it's during
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:59.040]   in the middle of the night, really,
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.900]   when alcohol blocks your REM sleep and your brain is smart.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.900]   It understands how much REM sleep you should have had,
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.660]   how much REM sleep you have not
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:10.580]   because the alcohol has been in the system.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.760]   And finally, in those early morning hours,
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.180]   when you're getting through to sort of six, seven, 8 AM,
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.460]   all of a sudden your brain not only goes back
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.220]   to having the same amount of REM it would have had,
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.860]   it does that plus it tries to get back
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.780]   all of the REM sleep that it's lost.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.560]   Does it get back all of the REM sleep?
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.520]   No, it doesn't.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.740]   It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries.
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.740]   And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.100]   Hence, you have really intense, bizarre dreams.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.540]   And that's what happens also with THC.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:44.020]   You build up this pressure for REM sleep,
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.900]   this debt for REM sleep.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.180]   Will you ever pay it back?
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.260]   Doesn't seem as though you get back everything that you lost,
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.820]   but will you get back some of it?
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.240]   Yes, the brain will start to devour more
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.500]   because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.500]   But one of the bigger problems with THC that we worry about
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.820]   is withdrawal dependency.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:09.140]   So as you start to use THC for sleep,
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:12.880]   there can be a dependency tolerance.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.780]   So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.300]   And when you stop using,
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.740]   you usually get a very severe rebound insomnia.
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.300]   And in fact, it's so potent
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.740]   that it's typically part of the clinical withdrawal profile
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:30.620]   from THC, from cannabis.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.340]   - And there's anxiety withdrawal.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:38.380]   I don't ask anybody to change their behavior.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.560]   We just, as you said,
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.620]   we try and inform people about what the science says
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.600]   and let them make choices for themselves.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.660]   People who are regular pot smokers,
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.900]   many will insist they're not addicted.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.660]   And maybe indeed they don't actually follow the profile
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.820]   of classical addiction.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.200]   I don't know, I'm guessing some do, some don't.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.260]   But if you ask them,
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.700]   well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.480]   for, I don't know, two weeks?
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.980]   That thought scares many of them.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.260]   And many of them will experience intense anxiety
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.140]   without marijuana, which speaks to perhaps not addiction,
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.380]   but a certain kind of dependency.
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:18.020]   And again, I know many pot smokers,
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.340]   some of whom have jobs that are quite high performing
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:22.820]   and they manage.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.420]   - Here in Berkeley, I don't know any of those.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.820]   - Yeah, none of those, right.
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.500]   What about CBD?
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.020]   I mean, we hear so much about CBD.
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.560]   I've been a little concerned about the fact
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.800]   that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.420]   has confirmed that much like with melatonin,
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.220]   the levels that are reported on the labels
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:43.460]   in no way, shape or form match the levels
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.540]   that are actually contained in the various supplements.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.640]   Sometimes the levels are much higher
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:49.620]   than they're reported on the labels.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.300]   Other times it's much lower.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:56.220]   What is ingesting CBD do to the architecture
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.280]   and quality of sleep?
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.980]   - Right now, I don't think we have enough data
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:05.220]   to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.780]   I think the picture that is emerging, however,
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.740]   is probably the following.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:13.840]   Firstly, CBD does not seem to be detrimental
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.220]   in the same ways that THC is.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.340]   So we can start by saying,
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:22.340]   does it create potential problems?
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.900]   Not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC,
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.840]   but the devil is a little bit in the details
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.260]   from the data that we do have
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.820]   and it comes onto your valid point of purity.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:39.660]   At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake promoting
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:43.460]   so in low doses, let's say sort of five or 10 milligrams,
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.880]   I'm trying to remember some of the studies
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.640]   off the top of my head,
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:49.560]   there it actually may enhance wakefulness
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.960]   and cause problems with sleep.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.600]   It's only once you get into the higher dose range
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   that there seem to have been some increases in sleepiness
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.800]   or sort of sedation like increases.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.160]   And that's usually, I think above about 25 milligrams
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.560]   as best I can recall from the data.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.840]   And then when we look in animal models,
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:17.880]   you typically see the same type of profile too.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.160]   So then the question becomes,
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.860]   and now again, you just don't know about purity,
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:25.440]   it's very difficult.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.520]   Although I think, and again, I'm not a user,
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   not necessarily because I have anything against it,
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.580]   it's just that's not necessarily my cup of tea.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.900]   There are some firms that are now doing third party
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.140]   independent laboratory tests.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.480]   I don't know how gamed that is so I've got no sense of it.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.160]   - I think some supplement companies are quite honest
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.740]   and accurate about the amounts of various substances
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.200]   that are in other products and some are not.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.040]   - Yeah.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.540]   - And I think there's just a huge range.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:58.360]   I think the FDA is starting to explore CBD.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.280]   There are, certainly I saw some grant announcements
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.260]   to explore the function of CBD.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.940]   Most of the work on CBD is being done by the general public
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.660]   ingesting it and seeing how they feel.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.140]   I gave it to my dog who was,
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.980]   had some dementia related sleep disturbances
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.740]   and it actually created a heightened wakefulness.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:16.220]   It completely screwed up his sleep.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.060]   - It sounds as though it just wasn't.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.220]   - He's a bulldog so if he's going to get access to sleep,
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.220]   he's going to take it.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.140]   - Okay.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.440]   - Really messed him up, took it away, he did better.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.660]   But that's a canine so.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.700]   - Right, and it could have been sort of dose related too.
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:32.700]   - Or binders or other things that are in there.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.540]   - Correct, yeah, and we, but right now if we were to,
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.300]   and I'm not making this statement,
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.980]   I don't think anyone can make the statement now,
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.640]   but if it ends up being that CBD is potentially beneficial
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.300]   for sleep, how can we reconcile that mechanistically?
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.940]   And I think there are, to me at least,
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.020]   there are at least three candidate mechanisms
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:57.400]   that I've been exploring and thinking about.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.440]   The first is that it's thermoregulatory.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.540]   And what we found in some animal models is that CBD
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.440]   will create a profile of hypothermia.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.040]   In other words, it cools the body,
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.640]   the core body temperature down.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.940]   And that's something that we know is good for sleep.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.080]   The second is that it's an anxiolytic,
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.840]   that it can reduce anxiety.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.400]   And that data is actually quite strong,
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.260]   even with some functional imaging work
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.600]   that's been coming out recently,
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.600]   showing that one epicenter of emotion called the amygdala
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.240]   deep within the brain is quietened down with CBD.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.680]   So I think that's at least a second
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.520]   non-mutually exclusive possibility.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.920]   I think the third is some recent data that's come out
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.760]   that was suggesting that CBD can alter
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.960]   the signaling of adenosine.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.360]   So it doesn't necessarily mean
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.320]   that you produce more adenosine,
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.000]   but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.920]   perhaps, of the brain so that the weight
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   of that same adenosine is weightier in its brain
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.680]   signal, and therefore it creates
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.220]   this stronger pressure for sleep.
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:09.040]   So I think these are all tentative mechanisms.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.700]   I think any one of them is viable.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.320]   I think all three are viable together.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.560]   But right now, I think, does that sort of help
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.560]   think through the tapestry of THC and CBD?
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.540]   - Yeah, very much so.
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.140]   And actually, it's a perfect segue from,
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:27.140]   we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC,
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.920]   and CBD as sort of, we framed them anyway,
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.600]   as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.120]   are probably okay for most people,
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.140]   certainly not for everybody,
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:39.000]   there will be differences in sensitivity,
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.120]   but that done at the incorrect times
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.520]   and certainly in the incorrect amounts
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:48.120]   will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.520]   CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.560]   to the topic I'd like to talk about next,
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.940]   which is things that promote more healthy sleep,
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.700]   or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:02.220]   and quality of sleep.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:06.700]   So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grant,
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.280]   the original, I should say that, not the granddaddy,
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.580]   but the OG of sleep supplementation, which is melatonin.
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.960]   The so-called hormone of darkness
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.460]   that's inhibited by light, et cetera,
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:21.420]   frame for us melatonin in the context
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.520]   of its naturally occurring form.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.840]   And then I'd like to talk about melatonin, the supplement,
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.340]   because as in my experience,
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.760]   anytime I say the word melatonin,
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.120]   people think about the supplement melatonin,
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.780]   which in itself is an interesting phenomenon
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.300]   that people are so cued to its role as something you take,
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.740]   we often forget that this is something
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.200]   that we make endogenously.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.460]   I'd love for you to comment in particular on,
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.140]   even though without necessarily getting
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.140]   into precise nanograms per deciliter values,
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.620]   what are the typical amounts of melatonin
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.760]   that we release each night?
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.640]   And then I'd like to compare that to what is contained
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.440]   in say a three milligram or six milligram tablet
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.560]   that one might buy at the pharmacy.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.060]   So I go to sleep at night,
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.820]   has melatonin already kicked in before I shut my eyes
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.780]   and lay down my head?
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.900]   - Usually, yes.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:12.060]   If your system is working in the correct way,
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.420]   as dusk is starting to happen,
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.300]   so let's say that you look at hunter-gatherer tribes
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.620]   who aren't touched by electricity.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.620]   And so that's sort of the puritanical state,
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:26.740]   par excellence when it comes to electric light influence.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:30.580]   And usually it's as dusk is approaching,
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:33.700]   that's when melatonin will start to rise.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:38.120]   And so when you lose the brake pedal of light
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.940]   coming through the eyes,
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.860]   that normally acts like a hard brake pedal
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.660]   that stamps down and prevents the release
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.740]   and production of melatonin.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:52.420]   As that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk,
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:55.380]   then we ease off the brake pedal and melatonin,
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.340]   the spigot of melatonin is opened up
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.820]   and melatonin starts getting released.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:04.900]   And usually we'll see this rising peak of melatonin
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:09.940]   sometime, usually an hour, two hours later or around,
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.780]   and it varies from different people
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.900]   around the time of sleep itself,
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:18.420]   but it's already been on the march for some hours
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:22.620]   before you actually hit sleep itself.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.460]   - Interesting.
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:26.380]   And I was always taught and I'm assuming it's still true
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.940]   that the only source of melatonin in the brain and body
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.140]   is the pineal gland.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.500]   Is that still true?
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.140]   - Yeah, it seems to be from best that we can tell
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:39.140]   and the pineal gland sort of meaning pee-like sort of shape.
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:42.680]   It's actually, I think usually people say it's pee-like.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.660]   I think if you look at the Latin derivative,
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:48.180]   it's more, I think it's derived from pine cone,
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:50.860]   not pee, because in fact, if you look at the pineal,
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:54.460]   it is more pine cone shaped and so it's aptly named.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.260]   - Any human brain I've ever dissected,
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.440]   I confess I've dissected a lot
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.580]   'cause I teach neuroanatomy and have for years,
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.220]   I love looking at the pineal.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.260]   It's the one structure in the brain
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:05.320]   that's not on both sides.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.080]   It's usually pretty easy to find and it's pretty good size.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.340]   It looks like a pee and it's sitting right there
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.180]   and it's remarkable that it releases this hormone,
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:18.560]   probably our entire lifespan and is inhibited by light.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.340]   So our pineal starts to release this
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:23.460]   into the general circulation.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.060]   I have to imagine we have melatonin receptors
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:26.300]   in the brain and body.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.060]   - It's correct, so yep.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:32.340]   Essentially your brain has a central master 24 hour clock
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:37.340]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that keeps internal time.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.820]   Now it's not a precise clock if left to its own devices,
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.460]   nothing that a Swiss clockmaker would be proud of.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.140]   It runs a little bit long and laggy.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.140]   - It's like an American clock.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:51.060]   So there are a couple of good American watches by the way.
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:53.740]   Hamiltons are very nice, but we're not famous
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:56.020]   for our timekeeping or our punctuality for them,
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.540]   but the Swiss are.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:01.060]   - It's not quite Swiss-like, it's more Berkeley-like,
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.600]   which is very relaxed, oh, you know, whatever.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:07.420]   So in most adults, the average adult, I should say,
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:10.260]   your biological clock normally runs a little bit long.
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:15.100]   It's about 24 hours and 13 minutes,
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.200]   I think was the last calculation.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.700]   But the reason that we don't keep drifting forward in time
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.980]   and kind of running consistently, you know,
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:25.940]   more later and later, 30 minutes by 30 minutes
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:30.020]   by 30 minutes each day is because your central brain clock
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:33.380]   is regulated by external things such as daylight
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.420]   and temperature, as well as food and activity.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:39.820]   All of these are essentially different fingers
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:43.700]   that come along and on the wristwatch of the 24-hour clock
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:46.660]   will pull the dial out and reset it each day
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:48.460]   to precisely 24 hours.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:53.460]   And I make that point because it knows 24-hour time,
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:57.660]   but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:00.500]   the 24-hour time as well.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.540]   And one of the ways that it does this
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:07.540]   is by communicating a chemical signal of 24-hour nurse,
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.020]   of light and day using this hormone melatonin.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:16.420]   And when it is at low levels or it's non-existent,
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:19.100]   it's communicating the message, it's daytime.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.340]   And for us, diurnal species, it says, it's time to be awake.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.900]   Yet at nighttime when dusk approaches
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.980]   and the brake comes off melatonin and we start to release it
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:31.900]   then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body,
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.020]   look, it's dusk and it's nighttime.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:38.220]   And for us, diurnal species, it's time to think about sleep.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:42.820]   So melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.300]   when it's day and when it's night.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.260]   And with that, when it's time to sleep,
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.720]   when it's time to wake.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.120]   And therefore that's why melatonin helps
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.780]   with the timing of the onset of sleep,
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.160]   but it doesn't really help
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.900]   with the generation of sleep itself.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.680]   And this is why we'll come on to what those studies
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.380]   of supplementation have taught us.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.660]   - So it tells the rest of my brain and body,
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.260]   it's time to go to sleep.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:07.880]   Perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep,
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.840]   but it's not going to, for instance,
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.180]   ensure the overall structure of sleep,
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:16.440]   or it's not the conductor that's guiding the sleep orchestra,
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.180]   so to speak, throughout the entire night.
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.020]   - Yeah, it's-
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:22.740]   - It's more like the people that essentially take you
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:25.020]   to your seat and sit you down and give you your program.
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.060]   - Right, exactly, yeah.
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:31.060]   Sort of the far less sophisticated analogy I have is,
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:33.380]   you know, melatonin is like the starting official
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.700]   at the 100 meter race in the Olympics.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:36.540]   - That's a better analogy.
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.220]   - It calls all of the sleep races to the line,
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.260]   and it begins the great sleep race.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:43.740]   - Yeah, better analogy, by the way,
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:46.520]   coming from the sleep researcher of all people.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.920]   - But it doesn't participate in the race itself.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.440]   That's a whole different set of brain chemicals
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.220]   and brain regions.
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.800]   Which then brings us on to perhaps the question
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:02.440]   of supplementation, which is,
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.200]   is it helpful for my sleep?
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.420]   Will I sleep longer, will I sleep better?
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.360]   And if I am, what doses should I be taking?
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.360]   Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults who are not older age
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.960]   suggests that melatonin is not really particularly helpful
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.040]   as a sleep aid.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.420]   I think there was a recent meta-analysis
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:28.080]   that demonstrated when it looked
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.040]   at all of the different sleep parameters.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.560]   Melatonin, and a meta-analysis
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.320]   for those not knowing what that is,
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.160]   it's a scientific sort of method that we use
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.960]   where we gather all the individual studies
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.400]   and we put them in a big bucket
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.760]   and we kind of do this kind of statistical fancy
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.280]   sleight of hand, and we try to come up with a big picture
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.480]   of what all of those individual studies tell us.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.480]   And what that meta-analysis told us is that melatonin
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.200]   will only increase total amount of sleep
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.280]   by 3.9 minutes on average.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.400]   - Minutes, not even percent.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.180]   - And it will only increase your sleep efficiency
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:04.040]   by 2.2%.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.640]   So it really--
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.000]   - This is as they say in certain parts of California,
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.500]   that's weak sauce, that's a weak sauce effect.
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.740]   - The sauce is not strong,
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.900]   the force is not strong in this one.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:21.160]   When it comes to a tool that in healthy people
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:24.200]   who are not of older age,
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.460]   it doesn't seem to be especially beneficial.
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.600]   Now, you know, results can vary.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.920]   Everyone is different, of course.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.460]   So we're talking about the average,
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:33.360]   the so-called average human adult here.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.380]   - Well, melatonin in defense of what you're saying,
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.280]   and also I should mention,
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.780]   I have a colleague at Stanford, Jamie Zeitzer,
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.240]   who we know comes from Chuck Zeitzer's lab at Harvard Med,
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.500]   where he also trained a terrific sleep researcher.
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.840]   And I asked him about melatonin
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.200]   and he essentially said the same thing that you just said,
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.320]   which is very little, if any, evidence
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.540]   that it can improve sleep.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:55.000]   And yet it's probably the most commonly consumed
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.440]   so-called sleep aid.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.120]   - Hundreds of million dollars industry.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.960]   - Yeah, so either massive placebo effect
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.200]   or it's operating through some other mechanism
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.560]   related to quelling anxiety, perhaps.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.400]   - Yeah, that is actually interesting.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.700]   You know, there are some studies
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.960]   where you do see some, you know, effects.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.180]   Now, again, when you do the grand average of all studies,
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:14.840]   it just doesn't seem to have an effect.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.620]   But let's assume that for some people
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.560]   it does have an effect.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:20.440]   Let's not, again, be sort of completely dismissive of that.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.000]   How could it have that effect?
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.480]   One of the reasons that I've become
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.040]   a little bit more bullish on melatonin
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.960]   from a sleep perspective,
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.420]   and then melatonin more generally for a,
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.900]   maybe we can speak about this too,
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.440]   as a counter measure
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.860]   when you're undergoing insufficient sleep,
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:43.080]   there are two different routes there.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.640]   The first reason that I think it could have a sleep benefit
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.760]   for some people is not because it helps
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.800]   in the generation of sleep.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.160]   We know that it doesn't.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.400]   It's because it too seems to drop core body temperature.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:55.520]   - There it is temperature again.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:59.000]   I'm fascinated these days more and more by temperature
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.620]   as maybe not just a reflection of brain state
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:05.460]   and wakefulness and in sleep,
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:08.720]   but actually a lever that is quite powerful.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:11.560]   And with all the interest in ice baths and hot showers
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.560]   and saunas and stuff,
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.020]   something that we will definitely touch on.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.320]   Temperature variation is so key.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.180]   So if melatonin is dropping body temperature
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.060]   by a degree or so,
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.580]   something that you've said before
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:25.400]   can help induce a sleepy state,
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.360]   maybe that's what's allowing people to get into sleep.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.400]   - I think that's one possibility.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.080]   I don't think melatonin by itself will drop it
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.720]   by sort of a degree, certainly not a degree Celsius.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:37.240]   And for ordinary in us to fall asleep
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.900]   and then stay asleep across the night,
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.040]   we do need to drop our core body temperature
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.800]   by about one degree Celsius
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.920]   or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.120]   And that's why it's always easier to fall asleep
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.040]   in a room that's too cold than too hot.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.440]   I think that that's one potential avenue
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.080]   that we are considering thinking more deeply about
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.160]   when it comes to melatonin.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.540]   And then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant,
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.840]   but let me table that for now
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.800]   'cause I'll just get us sidetracked.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.540]   That's what we know so far about melatonin
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:15.440]   in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.680]   Two final points that I shouldn't forget.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.980]   One is the only population where we typically see
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:25.260]   some benefit and it often is prescribed is in older adults.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.820]   Because as we-- - Older meaning 60 and older?
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.680]   - Yeah, 60, 65 and older.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.460]   Because as we get older, you can typically have
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.100]   what's called calcification of the pineal gland,
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.740]   which means that that gland that's releasing melatonin
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.080]   doesn't work as well anymore.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.720]   As a consequence, they tend to have a flatter overall curve
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.020]   of melatonin released throughout the night.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.280]   It's not this beautiful, lovely peak
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.000]   and this bullhorn message of it's darkness,
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.360]   please get to sleep.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.900]   That's why older adults can have problems falling asleep
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:56.960]   or staying asleep.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.360]   It's not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination,
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.540]   but it's one of the reasons
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.640]   and it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts,
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.840]   older adults, especially older adults with insomnia,
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.680]   people have thought about that
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:12.520]   as maybe an appropriate use case.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.720]   - Well, on those lines, if we were to compare dosages,
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.240]   do we know how much melatonin is typically released
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.160]   into the bloodstream per night?
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.440]   And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.060]   by which to compare the typical amount
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.320]   that someone would supplement?
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.920]   I mean, typically the supplements for melatonin that I see
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.120]   in the pharmacy and elsewhere and online
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.200]   range anywhere from one milligram to 12
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.360]   or even 20 milligrams.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:45.000]   My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin,
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.840]   typical for somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.840]   would be far lower than that.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.480]   Am I correct or wrong?
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:54.080]   - Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.480]   and this is one of the problems is that I see that too.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.420]   I see typical doses are five milligrams or 10 milligrams.
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:04.600]   And of course, if you're a supplement company,
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.720]   putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams,
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.960]   if that's what you're actually doing,
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960]   which we'll speak about purity as well.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.800]   It's kind of like the super gulp size.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.000]   Nobody wants to lower price.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.120]   They just want you to,
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.960]   we'll just give you more for the same price
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.000]   and that's how we'll compete.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.080]   So it's been this escalating arms race
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.980]   of melatonin concentration.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.800]   And it really does not look meaningful
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.000]   for sleep in any way.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.600]   What we've actually found is that the optimal doses
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.720]   for where you do get sleep benefits
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.200]   in the populations that we've looked at
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.200]   are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.320]   In other words, the typical doses are usually 10 times,
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.520]   20 times, maybe more than what your body
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:56.500]   would naturally expect.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:00.480]   And this is what we call a super physiological dose.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.320]   In other words, it's far above
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.840]   what is physiologically normal.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.200]   You know, and to put that in context,
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.400]   imagine I said to you,
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.200]   "I want you to eat 20 times as much food today."
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.920]   - I thought you were going to use testosterone as example.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.520]   You're going to take 300 times
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.720]   the normal amount of testosterone.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.440]   We know that would have tons of deleterious effects.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.280]   - Right. - It'd be terrible.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.680]   - Yeah. - And yet you can do this.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.240]   One thing that I'm concerned about
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:27.240]   about these super physiological levels of melatonin
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.500]   is that many years ago, actually here at Berkeley,
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.440]   when I was a graduate student,
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.360]   we would inject animals,
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.760]   which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.280]   And the consequence of that was that their gonads,
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.600]   either their testes or ovaries,
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.680]   would shrink many hundred fold or more.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.880]   In other words, they would go from having
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.400]   nice healthy-sized hamster testicles,
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.280]   what a hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster,
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.440]   and they would shrink to the size of a grain of rice.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.320]   So from like an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.880]   I had to see that only once for me to be very concerned
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:04.420]   about super physiological levels of melatonin.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.740]   And I realized that melatonin does different things
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:07.580]   in different species.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:10.900]   We are not hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders,
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:12.420]   seasonally restricted breeders.
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.140]   There might be more breeding during certain seasons.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.260]   I don't know those data.
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:18.540]   But nonetheless, hormones are powerful.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:21.980]   And sure, there is an optimal.
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   And sometimes we see that going slightly
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:28.300]   above endogenous levels for certain hormones,
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:30.460]   not always, can have beneficial effects.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.980]   And sometimes it can have detrimental effects.
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:37.040]   I'm just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:40.060]   that has effects on the reproductive axis.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.820]   And that's one of the reasons why I get very concerned
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:46.060]   when I see people really getting aggressive
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:51.060]   about melatonin supplementation, taking 110, 500,
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:53.620]   sometimes even 10,000 times the amount
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.580]   that we would normally release.
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.740]   That's my concern, although it's not nested
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:58.780]   in any one specific human study.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.220]   I just don't like to see,
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.900]   I certainly don't want to see other people
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:06.180]   and I don't want to personally take a hormone
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:10.620]   that's known to be androgen suppressive at high levels.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.600]   Why would I take that?
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.340]   That's the question I ask myself.
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:16.340]   - I think it's a very good point.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:19.700]   And if you look at some of the evidence
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:23.160]   around melatonin's lethality,
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.800]   if you want to go to that extreme,
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:27.520]   for the most part, it's pretty safe.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.620]   - You mean you can take a lot of it before you die.
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.140]   - Right, exactly, yeah.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.100]   But that should not be your yardstick for it
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:37.580]   because you really need to think about your health,
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:40.260]   not just whether this thing is going to kill you or not
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:44.580]   as the decision matrix through which you pop a pill.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:49.060]   And it comes on to this concern around melatonin
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.540]   because there was a study,
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.280]   I think it's one that you mentioned too,
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.840]   where they looked at over,
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.480]   I think it was at least over 20 different brands
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.660]   of melatonin supplements.
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.920]   And what they found is that based on what it said
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.960]   on the bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves,
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:08.460]   it ranged from, I think it was 83% less
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:09.820]   than what it said on the bottle
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:14.260]   to 478% more than what it said on the bottle.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.820]   Now, if that's a 10 milligram pill
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:23.820]   and it's 478% more than 10 milligrams
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:26.280]   and we're already at 10 milligrams
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:30.700]   at many tens of times more than is a physiological
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:34.100]   rather than a supra physiological dose,
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.960]   we do need to be a bit thoughtful.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.660]   - Yeah, remember those hamsters.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:43.200]   Well, and I do appreciate the deep dive on melatonin
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.340]   because I think people need to understand that it's nuanced.
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:50.020]   It's a matter of dosages and timing, et cetera.
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.180]   And then it may have its place
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.740]   as you mentioned in older individuals.
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.720]   And I should mention that I'm an avid consumer
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:59.560]   of supplements that I believe in for me.
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.900]   And I have been for a very long time.
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:04.340]   So I'm by no means anti supplement.
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.200]   Some supplements I refuse to take or avoid taking,
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.860]   others I am quite avidly take.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:13.660]   And along those lines, I personally,
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:17.600]   and I don't know what your thoughts on this are,
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.120]   but there are a few things
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.500]   that I've personally found beneficial.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.600]   I'd love your thoughts on them.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.680]   And I would love it if you would tell me
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:26.560]   that everything I'm about to refer to as placebo,
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.400]   that would be fine.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.680]   So that's what we do.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:29.840]   We're scientists, we argue,
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.500]   and then we remain friends as it goes.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:38.320]   So magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.840]   Magnesium citrate is, as we know, is a terrific laxative.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.600]   Magnesium malate seems, at least from a few studies,
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.160]   seems to relieve some of delayed onset muscle soreness,
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.960]   doesn't seem to create a kind of sedation.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.700]   Two forms of magnesium that I'm aware of,
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.160]   magnesium biglycinate and magnesium threonate.
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.620]   - Yeah.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.620]   - We believe, based on the data,
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.540]   can more actively cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.480]   So you put it in your gut,
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.840]   but some of that needs to get in your brain
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.600]   in order to have the sedative effect.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.140]   What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation?
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:10.560]   Do you supplement with magnesium?
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.540]   And what studies would you like to see done
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.180]   if they haven't been done already?
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:19.240]   - So I don't supplement with magnesium,
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.800]   but I do think threonate is interesting
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.740]   because of that higher capacity to cross the blood-brain
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:28.520]   barrier and actually have a central nervous system effect.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.160]   And the reason that that interests me
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:33.880]   is because the sleep is by the brain, of the brain,
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:37.840]   and also for the brain, as well as for the body.
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.840]   We just don't have a particularly good set of studies
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.800]   that have targeted exclusively threonate.
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.840]   We do have lots of studies that have just looked
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.240]   at magnesium in general for sleep.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.880]   And overall, the data is uncompelling.
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:52.720]   - Interesting.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.460]   - And for a while, I was confused as to why.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:01.900]   Where did this come from, this kind of myth of magnesium?
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.340]   So I started looking back into the literature
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:08.880]   and I've best traced it, at least as far as I can tell,
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:12.440]   to early studies showing that those who were deficient
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:15.800]   in magnesium also had sleep problems.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.920]   They had other problems too, of course.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.200]   But sleep problems were one of that set of sequelae
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.260]   that came from having lower magnesium.
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:28.120]   And when they supplemented with magnesium
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.760]   and tried to restore those levels,
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.320]   some of those sleep problems dissipated.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.000]   And then that seems to have gotten lost
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.480]   in some game of sort of like whispers around the room.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:40.920]   And it's become translated into people
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.720]   who don't have sleep problems,
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.360]   who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general,
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.920]   and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:51.600]   If they take more magnesium, they will sleep better.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.740]   And the data really there is not good.
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:56.980]   Once again, the only study that I've seen
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:59.240]   where magnesium did have some efficacy
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:00.880]   was in a study with older adults.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.000]   I think they were 60 to 80 years old.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.480]   It may have been exclusively women, now I think about it.
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.400]   And they also had insomnia.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.680]   And in that population, you did see some benefits.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.720]   And my guess is that because it's an older community as well
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.440]   they were probably deficient in magnesium.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:21.660]   So they fit the former category of simply
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.840]   when you're deficient and you restore,
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.460]   you can help sleep sort of return to normal.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:29.640]   But if you are not deficient and you're healthy
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.480]   and you're not old and you don't have insomnia,
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.920]   and you're supplementing thinking that it provides sleep,
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.600]   right now the data isn't supportive of that.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.960]   But I just don't think we have enough three and eight data
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.140]   to actually speak about that
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:44.200]   because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue so far
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.500]   with the other forms.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.960]   - So maybe some additional studies looking specifically
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.000]   at three and eight or by glycinate would be useful.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]   And magnesium is involved in so many cellular processes.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.640]   You can imagine that this effect, if it truly exists is,
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.160]   as we say in science, in the noise,
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:02.360]   meaning it's in the jitter of the data,
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:03.920]   but to isolate the real effect
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.220]   one needs to do some more refined studies.
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:11.160]   What are some things that are of interest to you,
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:13.360]   if not things that you happen to take?
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:16.620]   These are not things that I personally take,
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.880]   mostly because I just haven't experimented with them.
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.640]   Valerian root is one.
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.080]   Tart cherry and kiwi fruit.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:30.960]   Tell me about valerian root, tart cherry and kiwi fruit.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.560]   This is new to me.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.300]   I mean, I've certainly heard of them
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:38.020]   and tart cherry and kiwi sounds delicious,
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:41.320]   but what's happening with valerian root,
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:43.720]   tart cherry and kiwi and are we talking about
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.480]   eating tart cherries and kiwis and valerian roots?
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.120]   What are we talking about taking them in pill form?
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.500]   - Usually it's supplements,
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:54.880]   but it's also both for tart cherries and for kiwis.
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.120]   It's the actual fruit themselves.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:02.380]   Valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:04.940]   and lots of people swear by it too.
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:08.120]   But the evidence is actually quite against that.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.920]   Not that it makes your sleep worse,
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:13.360]   but of at least the seven good studies
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:14.560]   that I've been able to find.
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.800]   And typically these are of the nature of what we call
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.260]   a randomized placebo crossover design.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.640]   And I won't bore people with what that means.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:25.360]   It's sort of one of the-- - Good study, solid study.
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.680]   - Yeah, it's one of the sort of gold standard methods
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.540]   that we have when we're looking at intervention studies,
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.880]   such as drug studies.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:33.860]   Five of the seven found no benefit
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:36.140]   of valerian root on sleep.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:37.960]   Then two out of the seven,
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:40.700]   the data was just insufficient.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:42.100]   I think it was a power issue
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:45.280]   where they just couldn't make any strong conclusions.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:49.020]   And then I think there was the most recent study,
[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:56.300]   I think looked at two different doses of valerian.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:58.420]   I could have this wrong.
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.680]   And they just failed to find any effects once again.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:04.760]   But the stunning part of that paper, as I recall,
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:05.800]   they had this big table
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.400]   with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.800]   And there were well over 25 different things
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:14.240]   that they tried to see if valerian impacted.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.300]   And none of them were significant.
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:19.280]   Which stuns me because from statistical probabilities,
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:23.520]   we know if you just randomly perform 25 statistical tests,
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.240]   chances are probabilistically,
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.960]   you'll just get one significant result by random chance.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.540]   And even with random chance on their side,
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:36.160]   they still couldn't find a benefit of valerian.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.880]   - So valerian root might be worse than nothing at all
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.080]   if there is, so to speak.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.040]   - I mean, again, placebo effect,
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:44.600]   we can think about that too.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:45.960]   And I would say that if you feel
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.180]   as though it's having a benefit for you,
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.360]   and with all of the caveats that we have with supplements,
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.920]   things like melatonin, purity, concentration, et cetera,
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.620]   maybe it's no harm, no foul,
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:01.100]   but I'm not a medical doctor and I don't tell anyone about.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.160]   We have all of these disclaimers about not recommending--
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.480]   - Sure, and we'll include these.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:06.400]   I mean, I always say, we're not physicians,
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.360]   we don't prescribe anything.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.000]   We're scientists and professors, so we profess things.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.620]   And it's up to people to be responsible for their own health,
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:16.180]   not just to protect us, but to protect themselves.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:21.780]   I do want to hear about tart cherry and kiwi fruit.
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:24.320]   What's the story there?
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.160]   - Strange, isn't it?
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.120]   I was, you know, I'm kind of a hard-nosed scientist.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:32.840]   And when people, you know, some years ago started saying,
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.560]   oh, tart cherries, it's the thing, or kiwi fruits,
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.080]   I was thinking, oh my goodness, this sounds a bit--
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.200]   - You've been in California a little too long.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.200]   - Yeah, I know, yeah, the sun has softened me.
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.320]   But I thought, look, one of the things that we have to do
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:49.080]   as scientists is be as open-minded as possible,
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.320]   and I should not be so quick to dismiss.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.960]   So I went to the literature, just started reading
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:56.120]   as much as I could about it.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.440]   And there were three really good randomized
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.000]   placebo crossover trials with tart cherries.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.040]   And what they found was that in one study,
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.780]   it reduced the amount of time that you spent awake at night
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:14.520]   by over an hour, and then the other two studies,
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:17.680]   one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.840]   that you got by 34 minutes.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.820]   The other, it increased the amount of sleep
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:26.580]   that you got by 84 minutes, which, you know, these are,
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:30.140]   and what's striking is that they were independent studies,
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:32.980]   I think, meaning that they were from independent groups.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:35.440]   And these were, you know, some of these guys,
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.760]   you know, I and girls, I know pretty well.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.420]   - You know and trust their work.
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:41.980]   - Right, I really trust their work too.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:43.620]   - Were they ingesting actual tart cherries,
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.300]   are they drinking the juice or in capsule?
[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.240]   - It was juice.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:49.340]   So they, in all three studies, it was juice.
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:51.260]   Although you can, I think, as a supplement,
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.440]   you can buy it in a capsule and we've got no idea
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.340]   whether that changes the benefit or not.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.880]   What was also interesting in, I think it was that last study
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.340]   where they got an increase in sleep by 84 minutes,
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:06.380]   it also decreased daytime napping significantly.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.820]   - Oh, that's one that I could certainly make use of.
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:11.480]   I love my daytime naps, but I'd love to skip them too.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.380]   - Right, and we can speak about naps
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.980]   and sort of the upside and downside of that,
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:18.660]   which then made me think, well, if that's the case,
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:23.380]   maybe the net net benefit on sleep overall is no different.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:25.340]   It's just that it decreases the amount of time
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:27.980]   that some people were taking to sleep during the day
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:29.580]   and giving it back to the night.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.580]   But that wasn't the case 'cause if you added
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.500]   the total amount of sleep that they were getting
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:37.180]   without tart cherries, both naps and nightly sleep combined,
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:39.360]   still when you took tart cherries,
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.900]   you still got a net sum benefit of total amount of sleep.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.900]   So, you know, so far, when it comes to supplements
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.860]   and those types of studies, they're good studies
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:53.420]   and the data looks interesting.
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:57.320]   But as a drug itself, you know, if this was clinical drug,
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.460]   you know, three studies that are somewhat small in nature
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.020]   and have some positive benefit,
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:04.460]   that's what we would call preliminary data
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:07.580]   of maybe a chin scratching kind.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:08.820]   So keep this in context. - Yeah, and depending
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:10.820]   on the margins for safety, one might think,
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:13.260]   well, given that it's a tart cherry
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:16.160]   as opposed to some pharmaceutical you need a prescription for
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.860]   then, you know, some people their threshold
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:21.060]   to experiment with supplements is quite low,
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:23.100]   some people their threshold is quite high.
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.900]   I feel like, you know, there are two categories
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.960]   or at least two categories of folks out there.
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.140]   People who hear, oh, tart cherry can improve sleep
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.660]   and will run out and try it.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:35.160]   And people who hear, well, that sounds crazy,
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.220]   why would I do that?
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:39.000]   But of course, we have to remind people
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.820]   that tart cherry isn't really what we're talking about,
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.640]   presumably, if this is a real effect
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.300]   and it sounds like it might be,
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:47.680]   that there's a compound in tart cherry
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.160]   that if we were to call it whatever, whatever,
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.380]   five alpha six, you know, some molecule,
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:55.580]   if we referred to it by its technical name,
[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:56.980]   then people would say, oh,
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:59.260]   that sounds like a very interesting technical way
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.220]   to approach sleep, but doesn't sound very natural.
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:04.420]   So both groups are a little bit misguided
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:05.700]   in the sense that people who think
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.980]   that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods,
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.820]   plants, et cetera, things that grow out of the ground,
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.220]   that that's all safe, that's not true.
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:15.040]   And people that think that pharmaceuticals
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:18.780]   are the, if it's not evidence with the purified molecule,
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:20.700]   then something's not of utility.
[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:21.700]   Well, that's certainly not true.
[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:23.580]   Somewhere in the middle, I think, lies the answer,
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:25.820]   which is, it sounds to me like tart cherry
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:29.700]   is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid,
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:31.660]   intriguing potential sleep aid,
[02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:34.200]   and I'm underscoring potential.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.880]   I'm certainly intrigued by it to the point
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.300]   where I might experiment a bit,
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:39.780]   but I'm an experimenter for myself.
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.140]   Before I ask you about kiwi,
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:45.540]   I've had quite good results from taking something
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:48.540]   called apigenin, which is a derivative of chamomile,
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.520]   but in supplement form, I think I take 50 milligrams
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.580]   about 30 minutes before sleep,
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:58.580]   and I subjectively experience a better night's sleep,
[02:05:58.580 --> 02:05:59.980]   so to speak.
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:02.020]   I don't measure, I confess I don't measure my sleep.
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:03.600]   I'm not a sleep tracker guy.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:08.100]   But there are a few papers out there.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.220]   They're not what we would call published
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.900]   in blue ribbon journals, but they have control groups,
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:15.400]   and it looks somewhat interesting.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:18.080]   And there, when I say apigenin,
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:19.300]   people get somewhat intrigued.
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.140]   Oh, this molecule, chamomile,
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:24.340]   has long been thought to be a sedative,
[02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:26.260]   a mild sedative, but a sedative.
[02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:27.420]   Do you drink chamomile tea?
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:28.820]   Do you take apigenin?
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:29.980]   What are your thoughts on apigenin?
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:32.820]   - Yeah, I don't, and I have looked into
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:35.340]   some of the data regarding sleep as well.
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.020]   Right now, from best I can tell,
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:40.240]   it's mostly subjective data rather than objective,
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.300]   hard sort of sleep measures.
[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:44.400]   And that's why right now I, you know,
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.400]   it's sort of unclear, not no comment, but just unclear.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:52.340]   Not dismissing it, because I think you and I
[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:55.240]   both ascribe to the idea of absence of evidence
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.020]   is not evidence of absence.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:00.320]   So keep your mind open, at least I tell that to myself.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:04.300]   I think if you're finding a benefit,
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:06.700]   and you can do what I would think of
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:08.500]   if I was personally experimenting,
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:11.260]   which is both the positive and negative
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:12.220]   parts of the experiment.
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:13.660]   What I mean by that is, you know,
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.900]   let's say that I now want to, you know,
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.700]   think about some kind of a sleep supplement.
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.880]   I will take some kind of baseline set of recordings
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:26.500]   for a month, and I will just gauge where I'm at,
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:28.240]   sort of supplement free.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.380]   Then I'll go on for a month
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:32.440]   to whatever I'm thinking of taking,
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.060]   and I don't, you know, supplement,
[02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:37.460]   but let's say that I want to, and I experiment with that.
[02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:39.940]   And I feel as though, based on my metrics,
[02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.840]   be them objective from my aura ring,
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.460]   or be them subjective from whatever I'm, you know,
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:45.640]   writing down in the morning,
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:49.160]   and both are important and valid, subjective and objective.
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.760]   We like both in the sleep world.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:54.280]   And I think, okay, look, it's clearly that
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:56.980]   it seems to have some kind of an effect.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:00.340]   The key thing, however, is then do the negative experiment,
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:03.980]   which is now come off it for another month,
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:06.300]   and see, do things get worse?
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:09.260]   And if I can see that bidirectionality,
[02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:11.620]   then I'm starting to think,
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:14.100]   maybe I'm believing this a little bit more.
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:17.060]   So that's the way I would sort of typically approach,
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:20.260]   you know, a supplementation regimen if I were to do it,
[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:23.020]   and that's just me, that's just the way my mind works, but.
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:23.860]   - No, that's great.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:26.240]   I think it's very, very scientific and organized
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:29.600]   in a way that allows you and would allow other people
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:32.940]   to make very informed decisions for themselves.
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:33.780]   I like that.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:34.840]   - Right.
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:37.740]   - I like to think in terms of manipulating
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.700]   any aspect of our biology,
[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:43.940]   that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry.
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:46.700]   Then nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later,
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.300]   even if you're fasting.
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:52.260]   Then perhaps supplementation, then prescription drugs,
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.340]   and then perhaps brain-machine interface,
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:56.560]   devices that you use to induce something,
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.940]   and those could be done in combination.
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.260]   But what concerns me is when I hear people say,
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:03.980]   well, what should I take without thinking about
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:06.140]   their behavior, their light viewing behavior, et cetera.
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:08.420]   But of course these things work in combination.
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:11.300]   - I think you're right that there's many,
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.840]   when it comes to sleep, there are many low-hanging fruits
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:18.740]   that don't necessarily require you to, you know,
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:21.180]   put sort of exogenous molecules,
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.620]   in other words, things like supplements into your body,
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:26.500]   or, you know, use different types of drugs
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.080]   to help you get there.
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:31.400]   Now, when it comes to prescription sleep aids,
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.860]   I think I've been, again, a little bit too forthright.
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:38.360]   We know in clinical practice that there may be a time
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.600]   and a place for things like sleeping pills.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.600]   They are a short-term solution to certain forms of insomnia,
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.680]   but they are not recommended for the long-term.
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.440]   And we also know that there are lots of other ways
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:55.340]   that you can get a sleep help,
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:58.020]   or you can get a sleep curative profile
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:00.780]   from things like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:02.740]   which is a non-drug approach, a psychological one.
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:04.260]   - And quite effective from what I understand.
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:07.140]   - Just as effective as sleeping pills, great data,
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.700]   more effective in the long-term.
[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.520]   There was a recent study published that
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:11.900]   after working with that therapist,
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.780]   some of the benefits lasted almost a decade.
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:17.380]   You know, now, if you stop sleeping pills,
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.700]   usually you have rebound insomnia,
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:21.620]   where your sleep goes back to being just as bad,
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:23.200]   if not worse.
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:24.380]   And I think the same is true
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:25.800]   when we think about supplementation.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.580]   There are so many things that are easy to implement
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:31.220]   when it comes to sleep
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:34.340]   that don't require venturing out into those waters.
[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:36.860]   And again, we're not here to tell anyone
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:38.440]   about whether they should venture or not.
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:40.020]   That's completely your choice.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:40.860]   All I'm saying is that
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:43.660]   if you want to think about optimizing your sleep,
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:45.820]   there are a number of ways that you can do it
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:49.340]   that don't necessarily require you to swallow anything,
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:52.720]   or inject anything, or smoke anything, or free basis.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.560]   - And for which the margins of safety are quite wide.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:56.400]   - Right.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.220]   - That's the other one.
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:58.060]   - Yeah, sorry, thank you for that.
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:59.040]   - So speaking of low-hanging fruit,
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.100]   I don't know how low it hangs in reality,
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.620]   but what about kiwi?
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:04.260]   They're delicious to me anyway.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:06.080]   - Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.400]   Named not, shouldn't be mistaken
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:13.400]   for the flightless bird of New Zealand,
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:14.800]   which is the native bird there.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.700]   We're talking about the kiwi, the fruit here,
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.700]   which those trees and shrubs are mostly Southeast Asia,
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:23.060]   East Asia.
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:26.540]   Kiwi fruits have been previously touted
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.860]   as potentially having a sleep benefit,
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.100]   which again, got me curious,
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:32.800]   and I at first threw it out.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.820]   To my knowledge,
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:36.460]   there's really only one published human study
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:38.280]   that's of any value,
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.580]   but what they did find was that
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:42.240]   it decreased the speed of time
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.760]   with which it took you to fall asleep.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:45.480]   - These are people ingesting the whole kiwi?
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:46.820]   - So it's ingesting the whole kiwi.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:48.420]   - With the skin, I eat the skin.
[02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:49.820]   People cringe when they see me do it,
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:50.820]   but don't eat the skin.
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.660]   - No, no, no.
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.700]   I think the idea is some of the good stuff,
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:54.680]   and I'll come onto this,
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.080]   may actually be in the skin itself.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:00.020]   - Thank you, you just helped me win a bet.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:00.840]   I'll give you your--
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.420]   - Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later.
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.700]   By the way, this skin is used,
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.340]   no, no, no, he just told me to say that,
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.780]   so he went, no, he did not.
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:09.540]   So the skin seems to be part
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:12.140]   of this potential sleep equation,
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:16.460]   and that's that you fell asleep faster,
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.980]   and you stayed asleep for longer,
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:22.100]   and you spent less time awake throughout the night.
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.540]   And I just thought, well, you know,
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:26.340]   that's one study, what can you really do with that?
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:28.500]   There was another study, however,
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:31.160]   in an animal model, which is, you know,
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:33.380]   a little bit more interesting.
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:36.620]   And once again, they found a very similar phenotype
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:39.140]   that the rats, oh, sorry, they were mice.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:41.480]   The mice fell asleep faster,
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.860]   and they also spent longer time in sleep.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:47.100]   The sleep duration also increased.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.300]   What was also interesting mechanistically,
[02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:51.100]   and this is not the mechanism
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:55.100]   that I think ties together tart cherries,
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:58.740]   kiwi fruit, and, you know, things like melatonin,
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:02.260]   'cause I think there could be one common binding mechanism.
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:03.800]   What they found in the animal study
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:08.340]   is that they could block those kiwi fruit sleep benefits
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:11.300]   using a GABA blocking agent.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:16.300]   Now, GABA, GABA, which stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid,
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:20.220]   is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters of the brain.
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:21.540]   It's kind of like the red- - So a naturally occurring
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:23.220]   sedative, sort of. - Right, yeah.
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:26.300]   It's the kind of the red light on the traffic light signal.
[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:28.780]   You know, others are green light.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:32.020]   GABA is red light.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:35.800]   So by playing around with some sort of clever drugs
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:37.340]   to manipulate the system,
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:40.200]   they could prevent the benefit of the kiwi fruit
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:43.340]   by sort of buggering around with the GABA receptor,
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:48.220]   meaning that perhaps part of the kiwi fruit benefit on sleep
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.620]   was mediated by the brain's
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:53.820]   natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.420]   called the GABA system. - That's exciting.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:57.020]   - And I thought that that was kind of,
[02:13:57.020 --> 02:13:58.500]   that convinced me a little bit more
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:01.240]   that maybe there's something here to read into.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:06.140]   So to be determined, again, here is the banner,
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.500]   but, you know, tart cherries and kiwi fruits,
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:13.500]   the data surprised me because in part I was so preoccupied
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:18.540]   with being, you know, I don't know,
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:20.820]   a bit pure-ish about it and a bit snobby thinking,
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:23.220]   oh, come on, that's definitely not going to work.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:25.320]   Well, the data's so far. - Compounds are compounds.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.980]   I look forward to a day when supplements
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.300]   are no longer called supplements
[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:29.220]   because at the end of the day,
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:30.940]   whether or not something has an effect,
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:32.280]   whether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:33.860]   or a derivative kiwi fruit
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:35.500]   will depend on the molecular compound.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:38.660]   And as you mentioned this potential mechanism
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:40.180]   via the GABA system,
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:44.400]   that's, we both as scientists get excited about mechanism
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.500]   'cause when you can trace a mechanism in a pathway,
[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:49.660]   it provides a rationale, a grounding for why kiwi
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.920]   of all things or tart cherry of all things
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.020]   might help increase total sleep time.
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:58.360]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.660]   or ask about tryptophan and serotonin.
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:05.920]   I can anecdotally say when I've taken tryptophan,
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.340]   the precursor to serotonin or serotonin itself,
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:12.620]   I have a horrendous night's sleep.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.660]   I fall asleep very easily
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:19.540]   and I experience ridiculously vivid dreams,
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:22.260]   neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it's kind of a mishmash.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:26.980]   And then I wake up and I experience several days of insomnia
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:29.580]   that, and I've done the positive control
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:32.340]   and the negative control and all the variations thereof
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:34.640]   to confirm that at least for me,
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:39.640]   supplementing with serotonergic agents is a bad idea for me.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.700]   And tryptophan is a common sleep supplement
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:46.640]   and sleep aid that's discussed.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:50.180]   The normal architecture of sleep
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:52.100]   involves the release of serotonin,
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:54.060]   but in a very timed and regulated way.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:56.580]   What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep?
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:59.140]   If you had to kind of put that into a nutshell
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:03.520]   and then why supplementing with serotonin
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.980]   and or its precursor, tryptophan,
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:08.640]   might be a good or a bad idea for somebody?
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.620]   - I think one of the potential dangers
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:18.220]   is that based on what's going on in your body,
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:22.980]   that can change the absorption of natural sort of tryptophan
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:26.180]   and serotonin uptake within the brain itself.
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:29.620]   So I'm always thoughtful when you're playing around
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:32.820]   with that mother nature dynamic, as it were.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:34.220]   The data, as you described,
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:35.820]   is a little bit all over the map.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.740]   Some people say that it knocks them out.
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:39.780]   Other people say, just like you do,
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.300]   it has a terrible impact on my sleep.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:46.420]   And when I stop, it's pretty bad for a couple of days.
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:49.580]   It seems to have this lingering after effect.
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:53.860]   I think what could be happening here
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:57.260]   is we need serotonin to, just as you described,
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:16:59.540]   be modulated in very specific ways
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.220]   during the different stages of sleep.
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:05.860]   If you look at the firing of the brain epicenters
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.980]   where serotonin is released,
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:10.220]   and there's a bunch of them in the brainstem,
[02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:15.220]   what you find on the release of serotonin too,
[02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:18.180]   when we're awake, it's usually in high concentrations.
[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:20.420]   As we start to drift off to sleep,
[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:23.820]   it lowers some, but not necessarily dramatically
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.500]   as we're going into non-REM sleep.
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:31.500]   But then when we go into REM sleep, serotonin is shut off.
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:35.540]   The other, one of the other neuromodulators, noradrenaline,
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.340]   also shut off.
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:41.340]   REM sleep is the only time during the 24-hour period
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:43.940]   where we see noradrenaline and serotonin,
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:46.820]   or norepinephrine, completely shut down.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.660]   When I say serotonin, we're also talking 5-HTP,
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:52.660]   sorry, 5-HT, that's just its chemical name here.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.140]   So whether we're speaking about serotonin or 5-HT,
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:58.340]   it's the same thing, norepinephrine, noradrenaline,
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:00.860]   both of those need to be shut down
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.220]   for you to produce REM sleep.
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.500]   The other, one of the other neuromodulators
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:09.700]   that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is acetylcholine.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:13.380]   So these three neuromodulators
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:17.900]   have this incredible reciprocal dance that they have
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:21.100]   for you to generate what is called a natural architecture
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:22.340]   of sleep throughout the night.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:23.420]   - It's the push-pull again.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:28.580]   - It's a push-pull again, it's chest and back,
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:30.900]   whatever you want to think of.
[02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:34.180]   That's why I think if you're trying to increase,
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:37.820]   dramatically drive up your serotonin levels at night,
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:39.460]   and that sustains throughout the night
[02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:41.380]   when you're trying to get into REM sleep,
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.620]   you could be artificially fragmenting REM sleep.
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:44.700]   Now, I don't know the data,
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:47.140]   I don't think anyone's really got the data,
[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:48.780]   but that's why I would be,
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:53.780]   if you were to say, Matt, two years time, that's the data,
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.860]   help me understand the potential mechanism,
[02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:58.860]   or let's design some experiments, where would you go first?
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:00.900]   I would say, let's look at the disruption
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:04.500]   of REM sleep, non-REM sleep, reciprocal regulation,
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:08.700]   because you need serotonin to be up at one time,
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:10.980]   down at another, so.
[02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:13.460]   - I agree with everything you said,
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:17.860]   and I'm personally never taking tryptophan or serotonin again
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:20.500]   unless there's some clinical reason for that,
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.860]   that I would need to do that.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:26.460]   I want to ask about some other pro-sleep behaviors,
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:30.260]   but before I do that, let's talk about naps.
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:34.740]   I love naps, I come from a long history of nappers.
[02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:36.940]   My dad always took a nap in the afternoon,
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:40.260]   I take a 20 or 30 minute nap, or I do a practice
[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:43.740]   which I took the liberty of coining NSDR, non-sleep,
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:46.980]   deep rest, some sort of just passive laying out there,
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:49.300]   feet up, elevated, sometimes people do you,
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.580]   or I'll do yoga nidra, I'll do hypnosis
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:56.060]   or something of that sort, but 20 or 30 minutes of that
[02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:59.340]   has been very beneficial for me to get up from that nap
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:03.100]   or period of minimal wakefulness, we'll call it,
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:04.940]   and go about my day quite well,
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:07.060]   and also fall asleep just fine.
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:10.420]   What are the data on naps?
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:13.480]   Do you nap, and what are your thoughts
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:17.140]   about keeping naps short, meaning 20 to 30 minutes
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:20.540]   versus getting out past 90 minutes, two hours?
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:25.060]   So for you personally, naps, yay, nay, or meh?
[02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:30.060]   - I don't nap, and I've just never been a habitual napper.
[02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:33.140]   - Is that because you don't feel sleepy in the afternoon
[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:34.080]   or because-- - I typically
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:35.500]   don't feel sleepy. - Okay, so you're just
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:38.020]   hardier than I am. - I wouldn't say hardier.
[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:43.020]   I may be less capable of falling asleep.
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:45.480]   My sleep drive-- - But you're not dragging
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.740]   through the afternoon. - No, no, I don't drag
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:48.580]   through a nap. - So you don't nap
[02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:50.140]   because you don't feel a need to nap.
[02:20:50.140 --> 02:20:51.120]   - That's right, yep.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:54.120]   Now, it's not that I am immune to what we call
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.520]   a postprandial dip in alertness.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:58.520]   I definitely feel as though there can be this
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:03.520]   kind of afternoon lull where I'm not quite as on
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:06.120]   as I was at 11 o'clock in the morning,
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.900]   and we know the physiology to that,
[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:10.740]   which brings us back to whether we were designed to nap.
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:15.140]   So for naps, we've done lots of different studies,
[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:17.200]   and other colleagues have done these studies too.
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:19.580]   Naps can have some really great benefits.
[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:22.180]   We found benefits for cardiovascular health,
[02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:23.720]   blood pressure, for example.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:26.020]   We found benefits for levels of cortisol.
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:28.360]   We found benefits for learning and memory,
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:30.900]   and also emotional regulation.
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:33.460]   - How long are the naps typically in those studies?
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:36.240]   - Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90 minutes.
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.680]   Sometimes we like to use a 90-minute window
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:42.000]   so that the participant can have a full cycle of sleep,
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.560]   and therefore they get both non-REM and REM sleep
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:45.680]   within that time period.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:47.160]   Then when we wake them up,
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:49.540]   we usually wait a period of time to get them past
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:51.200]   what we call sleep inertia,
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.060]   which is that kind of window of grogginess
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:54.800]   where you say to your better half,
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.860]   look, you know, darling, please don't speak to me
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:21:59.080]   for the first hour after I've--
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:00.240]   - Don't anything right now.
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:01.800]   - After the first hour of waking up,
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:05.320]   you know, I'm just not the best version of myself.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:06.740]   So we wait for that time period,
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.480]   and then we do some testing,
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:10.180]   and we've done some testing before and after,
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:11.340]   and we look at the change,
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:13.720]   and that's how we measure what was the benefit of naps,
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:15.800]   and the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:17.820]   so that they get all of those stages of sleep,
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:20.580]   and then we correlate how much benefit
[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:22.220]   did you get from the nap,
[02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:24.440]   and how much of that benefit was explained
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:27.660]   by what REM sleep you got, what deep sleep you got,
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:29.100]   what light sleep you got.
[02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:30.880]   So that's the only reason that we use that
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.200]   as an experimental tool.
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:37.760]   What we've also found is that naps of as little as 17 minutes
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:41.780]   can have some quite potent effects on, for example, learning.
[02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:43.500]   None of this is novel.
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:47.020]   NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s,
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.380]   and during the missions,
[02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:51.340]   they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts,
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:55.480]   and what they found was that naps of little as 26 minutes
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:23:00.480]   improved mission performance by 34%
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:04.420]   and improved daytime alertness by 50%,
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:08.780]   and it birthed what was then called the NASA nap culture
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:12.500]   throughout all terrestrial NASA staff
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.680]   during that time period.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.980]   So it's long been known that naps can have a benefit.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:19.240]   Naps, however, can have a double-edged sword.
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:22.180]   There is a dark side to naps,
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:23.860]   and it comes back to our story
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:26.060]   of adenosine and sleep pressure.
[02:23:26.060 --> 02:23:27.200]   The longer we're awake,
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.980]   the more of that sleep pressure adenosine that we build up,
[02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:32.740]   but what I didn't tell you is that when we sleep,
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:36.880]   the brain gets the chance to essentially clear out
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:41.520]   that adenosine, and after about 16 hours of wakefulness,
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.820]   and then after about eight hours of sleep,
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:47.220]   eight hours of sleep seems to be able to allow the brain
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:50.900]   to decrease its adenosine levels back to normal,
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:53.420]   and so naturally we should start to wake up,
[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:55.480]   which also aligns with your circadian rhythm,
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.600]   and those are two separate processes,
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:00.880]   but with about eight hours of good quality sleep,
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:03.160]   seven to nine hours for the average adult,
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.160]   we are free of all of that adenosine.
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:08.960]   We've evacuated it essentially out of the brain,
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:11.960]   and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed.
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:14.740]   The reason that naps can be potentially dangerous
[02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:16.680]   is that when you nap,
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.600]   you are essentially opening the valve
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:22.560]   on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure,
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.500]   and some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap,
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:29.640]   so for some people, and not all people,
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:32.280]   and you're a great example of this,
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.560]   some people, however,
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:36.460]   if they are struggling with sleep at night,
[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:37.840]   and they nap during the day,
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:40.360]   it makes their sleep problems even worse,
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:41.760]   so for people with insomnia,
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.800]   we typically advise against napping,
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.640]   and the advice is if you can nap regularly,
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.080]   and you don't struggle with sleep at night,
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:51.760]   then naps are just fine,
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:54.980]   but if you do struggle with sleep, stay away from naps.
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:56.640]   If you are going to nap,
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:58.820]   try to limit your naps,
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.460]   try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine,
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:04.300]   maybe eight to sort of 12 hours,
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:06.120]   maybe not that far off,
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.760]   maybe sort of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:12.720]   Try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon,
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:14.940]   and if you do take a nap,
[02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:17.300]   and you want to maintain your,
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:19.640]   you don't want to have that grogginess hangover
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:21.360]   that can happen after a full night of sleep
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:22.560]   for the first hour,
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.060]   try to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes,
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:27.600]   and that way you don't go down
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.000]   into the very deepest stages of sleep,
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.160]   which if I wrench you out of with an alarm,
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:34.640]   then you just kind of feel,
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:37.920]   you almost feel worse for the first hour after the nap.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:40.100]   - I've definitely experienced that if I oversleep.
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:43.080]   Certainly if the sun goes down during my nap,
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.040]   and I wake up and overall lighting conditions have changed,
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:50.800]   I find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening,
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:52.360]   and it can screw me up,
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.600]   so I try and keep those naps pretty brief,
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:58.620]   and I should say, I'm very happy to hear you mention
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:01.180]   individual differences and why some people might want to nap
[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:03.700]   and other people might not want to nap.
[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:06.220]   I have a colleague, Leach and Lowe,
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:08.540]   he'll be familiar to many neurobiologists,
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:11.020]   who's an absolutely spectacular scientist,
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.120]   member of the National Academy, Howard Hughes Investigator,
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:16.060]   just a phenom, and has a ton of energy,
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:20.280]   but years ago, I learned that he always takes a nap
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.540]   in the afternoon, so much so that when he travels
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:24.380]   to give seminars at other universities,
[02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:29.380]   he will tell his post lunch, post, whoever it is
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:31.480]   that he's supposed to meet with,
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:33.620]   may I have your office for 30 minutes
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:36.540]   of our sometimes 30 minute discussion
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:38.860]   or 60 minute discussion, because I like to take a nap,
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:41.300]   and he does that, and then gives his talks
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:43.820]   are typically in the afternoon in academic culture,
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:48.820]   and he describes the effect of the nap for him,
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:51.220]   the short naps in the afternoon being so profound
[02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:53.220]   for his productivity, that's actually what inspired me
[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:56.220]   to start feeling okay about my desire to nap,
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:58.720]   and so I think for me, that was great vindication
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.120]   for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap,
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:06.580]   but I take to heart your note about avoiding naps
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:08.300]   if you have trouble falling and staying asleep,
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.960]   'cause I think that I have family members who also,
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:13.340]   if they nap, they're a wreck, they can't sleep.
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:14.940]   - Yeah, I think it's just,
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:17.800]   we've often been very pro sleep,
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:19.300]   we as the sort of the sleep community,
[02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:22.140]   so I think it's good to always point out
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:25.700]   these potential dark sides of any aspect,
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:28.080]   but you're absolutely right, no one should feel guilty
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.700]   about getting the sleep that they need,
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:33.700]   and I think that's been one of the big problems in society,
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:36.900]   society has stigmatized sleep with these labels
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:40.900]   of being slothful or lazy, and we're almost embarrassed
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:43.940]   to tell colleagues that we take a nap.
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:48.340]   I think sleep is a right of human beings,
[02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:51.940]   and I therefore think that sleep is a civil right
[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:55.540]   of all human beings, and no one should make you feel
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:58.540]   un-proud of getting the sleep that you need.
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:01.960]   - I love that, and it's an important point.
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:04.860]   I also feel that one of the best ways to beat
[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:07.440]   your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them.
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.360]   So now that we know that sleep can enhance longevity
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:14.720]   and lack of sleep can shorten one's life,
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:17.860]   that's all the justification I need anyway,
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.120]   can somebody sleep too much?
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:23.980]   Is it possible to get too much sleep?
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.500]   - It's a very good question, and there are probably
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:30.660]   two things to say about it.
[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:33.760]   There is a condition that we call hypersomnia,
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.220]   but that's a mixture of things.
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:40.120]   It's where people have either a very high sleep need,
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.140]   or they are very sleepy during the day,
[02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:44.780]   and they're typically falling asleep,
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:46.520]   and these can happen in a variety
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:48.380]   of different clinical contexts.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:52.220]   One of the places where we've often seen hypersomnia
[02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:56.200]   believed to manifest is in depression,
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.580]   but if you look at some of those studies,
[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:01.380]   it turns out it looks more as though those people
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:04.580]   are simply reporting being in bed longer,
[02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:08.000]   but not necessarily sleeping longer,
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.180]   and that fits very well with one of the profiles
[02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:13.340]   that we know of depression, which is anhedonia.
[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.720]   You don't get pleasure from normally pleasurable things,
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:17.760]   so you just don't want to go out into the world.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.760]   You don't want to interact because you're depressed,
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.720]   so what do you do?
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:21.840]   You just stay in bed.
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:23.560]   - Blinds, clothes, watching TV, on the phone.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:25.800]   - Right, and that just looks as though,
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:28.160]   when people say, "What time did you go to bed,
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:30.680]   "and what time did you get out of bed?"
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:32.860]   The mistake made in that question is,
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:34.640]   "Okay, that's how much time they're sleeping,"
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.240]   when you should have said, "What time did you fall asleep,
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:39.000]   "and what time did you wake up?"
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.220]   And the answer could be very different.
[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:45.640]   So that's hypersomnia from a clinical context.
[02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:49.280]   Can you sleep too much, though?
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:52.360]   One of the data points that argue is yes, that's possible,
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:54.740]   is when we look at all-cause mortality.
[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:56.440]   Certainly what you find is that,
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:59.040]   using the sweet spot of seven to nine hours,
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.600]   when you start to drop below seven hours,
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.540]   there is a relationship which suggests
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:05.680]   that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:08.760]   Short sleep in that regard predicts all-cause mortality.
[02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:10.760]   But it's again not a linear relationship
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:13.060]   like the one that we've seen with REM sleep.
[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:15.320]   Once you get past nine hours,
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:18.160]   the mortality curve stops going down,
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.640]   and then once you get further, 10 or 11 hours,
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.860]   it hooks back up again.
[02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:23.640]   It's almost like a J shape,
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:26.240]   tilted over a little bit and reversed.
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:27.760]   So there's this strange hook.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.520]   What's going on here?
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:32.060]   Right now, sleep science has at least
[02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:35.320]   two non-mutually exclusive explanations for this.
[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:38.560]   The first is that if you look at some of those populations,
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:43.560]   the idea is that whatever was causing them illness
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:46.600]   and took their lives was just too much
[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:47.940]   for sleep to deal with.
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:50.320]   However, we know that when we get sick,
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:51.840]   one of the things that we do immediately
[02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:54.640]   in this whole mechanism, an inflammatory mechanism,
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:58.400]   cytokine mediated, when we get sick, we want to sleep more.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:02.560]   We just want to curl up in bed and sleep it off.
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:05.560]   So the argument there is that it's not that sleep
[02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:07.920]   was killing people prematurely,
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:11.960]   it was that these people were calling on the help of sleep.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:13.680]   They were calling on this thing called
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:17.080]   the Swiss army knife of health that is sleep.
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.280]   But whatever it is that they were facing
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:23.620]   was just too powerful for sleep to overcome.
[02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:26.760]   So it artificially looks as though more sleep
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:29.400]   leads to a higher risk of death
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:32.620]   when sleep was actually responding to the mortality risk
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:33.760]   and it lost the battle.
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:35.400]   That's one argument.
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:39.200]   The second is that we know that sleep quality
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:43.280]   and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:45.520]   of all cause mortality.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.960]   And when you look at people who often report
[02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:51.280]   sleeping long amounts, 10 or 11 hours,
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:54.740]   they typically report having very poor quality sleep.
[02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:57.240]   So because their quality of sleep is poor,
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:59.400]   they just try to sleep longer
[02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:01.740]   to try and get some of that back.
[02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:05.280]   So again, here now it's poor quality sleep
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:10.280]   masking as too much sleep leading to this artificial hook,
[02:32:10.280 --> 02:32:12.840]   which looks like mortality.
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:14.340]   That's a second explanation.
[02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:17.080]   A third, which is more of a good Duncan,
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.440]   which is just the kind of like a thought experiment.
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:21.560]   And I'm of this mentality.
[02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:24.520]   I don't know how many other people share this.
[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:28.880]   I actually think that could be a thing as too much sleep.
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:31.360]   Physiologically, I think it's possible.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.260]   But the reason I think that is because it's no different
[02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:37.100]   than food, water, or oxygen.
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:38.640]   Can you overeat?
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.480]   Yes, you can.
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:40.300]   Can you under eat?
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:41.140]   Of course.
[02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:42.640]   - Or light, light in the early part of the day,
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:43.640]   throughout the day, wonderful.
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:45.840]   Light late in the day and at night, detrimental.
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:47.360]   - Bi-directional.
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.440]   For water, can you over hydrate hyponutremia?
[02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:54.800]   It can lead, it happened in the 1990s and 2000
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:56.320]   with the ecstasy craze,
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:58.260]   where governments were saying you're dehydrating,
[02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:00.680]   you're dancing all night, please drink water.
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:02.580]   And they drank too much water.
[02:33:02.580 --> 02:33:06.080]   The blood electrolytes went all over the place
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:08.280]   and they were having cardiac arrests or stroke.
[02:33:08.280 --> 02:33:09.120]   - Yeah, people were dying.
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:12.000]   - And they were dying because of excessive hydration.
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.960]   Can you get too much oxygen, hyperoxemia,
[02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:17.040]   and it can cause free radical damage,
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:21.080]   which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells.
[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:23.400]   Can you sleep too much?
[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:27.120]   Which is the fifth element of the life equation,
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:31.840]   alongside food, water, oxygen.
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:34.780]   So fourth, I should say, can't even count.
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:36.180]   Clearly I'm sleeping well.
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:40.680]   Yes, I think there could be that possibility.
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:44.720]   Are most people in danger of getting too much sleep?
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:47.600]   Au contraire if you look at the data.
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:50.000]   So, but I don't dismiss that idea.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.040]   I think it's possible.
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.960]   - All right, that's a very thorough and very nuanced
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.340]   and yeah, very clear answer.
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:34:01.220]   So it's so interesting to think that a lot of the data
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:04.220]   that out there that talking about being in bed too long,
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:05.760]   that it's just trying to compensate
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:08.600]   for the actual fragmentation of sleep.
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.780]   So what I'm coming away with is that there are many paths
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:14.900]   to this and both positive and things to avoid.
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:19.660]   But the idea is to get most nights a similar amount,
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:22.040]   probably seven to nine hours, somewhere in there,
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:24.040]   of high quality sleep.
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:27.120]   That this notion of sleep quality is going to become,
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:30.640]   I would hope, a phrase that more people think about
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:33.060]   and learn about and cultivate as a practice.
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:38.600]   Want to ask about a set of behaviors that I'm at least,
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.440]   I'm aware of at least one company is starting to track
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.120]   in their sleep monitoring device, and that's orgasm.
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.640]   And sex, orgasm, and masturbation,
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.100]   topics that are, you know, are somewhat sensitive,
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:57.720]   but from the perspective of biology, right?
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.320]   None of us would be here were it not
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:01.360]   for a sperm meets egg in some fashion,
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.440]   either in a dish or in vivo.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:09.340]   But what are the data, as you know them to be,
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:12.480]   or maybe your lab is even doing this kind of work
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:17.480]   and exploration, about the role that sex, orgasm,
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:19.960]   masturbation play in getting to sleep
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:22.500]   and staying asleep and sleep quality?
[02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:25.680]   Certainly those behaviors and those physiological events
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:27.840]   have been part of our evolutionary history.
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:30.400]   What's the story there?
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.660]   What can we say about this in terms of science
[02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:36.940]   and dare I say, practice?
[02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:39.740]   - Yeah, I mean, it's almost that caricature of,
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:41.800]   you know, in the movies where, you know,
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:44.300]   a couple makes love and then all of a sudden
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:47.440]   you just sort of hear snoring or, you know,
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:51.060]   with the idea that it's somewhat somnogenic,
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:52.720]   that it's sleep promoting.
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:55.400]   - Well, the post-orgasmic increase in prolactin
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:00.400]   is thought to be a naturally occurring sedative
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:03.120]   that presumably has a function in-
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.800]   - And oxytocin has that also that benefit
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.920]   where you see, you know, a dissipation
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.720]   of the fight or flight branch of the nervous system,
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:12.120]   which has to happen for you to fall asleep.
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:14.000]   That's why we often see, you know,
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.320]   here at the sleep center,
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:18.620]   we'll see a phenomenon called wired and tired,
[02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:22.260]   where people say, look, I am so desperately tired.
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:26.220]   I just, I'm so, so tired, but I can't fall asleep
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:27.740]   because I'm too wired.
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:31.260]   So your sleep drive, you're desperately tired.
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:33.860]   It's there, but because you're wired,
[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:36.020]   because you've got too much sympathetic activation,
[02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:39.060]   too much cortisol as well, you can't fall asleep.
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:44.060]   It's an impressive roadblock to anything like good sleep.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.640]   And it's one of the principle mechanisms
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.980]   that we now believe, stress and physiological activation,
[02:36:49.980 --> 02:36:54.180]   that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia.
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:57.320]   But coming back to sex,
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:00.200]   the data is actually quite compelling
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:04.000]   that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.540]   or objective amount of sleep.
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:10.340]   Sex that has resulted in orgasm,
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:12.440]   and I think it's that latter part
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:14.460]   that typically needs to happen.
[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:15.760]   - I would imagine so.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:20.760]   That, you know, so between two mutually exclusive individuals
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:23.760]   where both are, you know,
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:26.360]   beneficial in terms of receiving an orgasm.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:28.160]   - Yeah, I would say any discussion about sex,
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:32.020]   we were referring to consensual, age appropriate,
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:35.880]   species appropriate, context appropriate.
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:37.600]   - Wow, I would never have even gone
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:38.760]   to the species appropriate. - I put species in there
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.960]   because it's the internet
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.680]   and people will come up with all sorts of ideas.
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:43.640]   So I think that age appropriate,
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:46.600]   I think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate,
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:48.360]   and species appropriate covers all the bases.
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:50.640]   But if I missed any, put them in the comment section
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:51.840]   and we'll be sure to take notes.
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.060]   - Yeah, no, I think that's really well said
[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:56.700]   and important to say.
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:58.700]   So the data is the,
[02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:02.880]   when you look at couples who have orgasm,
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.760]   we've also however found benefits of masturbation.
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.580]   And it's not frequently spoken about,
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:12.960]   but if you do some surveys,
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.600]   it turns out that people will often use masturbation
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:18.840]   as a sleep tool if they're struggling with sleep.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.640]   And I know this sort of sounds almost
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:23.280]   like a strange conversation or it's a taboo conversation,
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:25.720]   but I think we just need to be very open about all this.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:27.640]   - I started off in science,
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:30.360]   one of the things I worked on early in my career,
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:31.620]   not the very first topic,
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:35.840]   was the topic of early influences of hormones,
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.700]   estrogen and testosterone on sexual development
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:40.040]   of the brain and body.
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:43.600]   And when you are weaned in a laboratory like that,
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:45.160]   regardless of what era,
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:49.440]   you look at sex and its behaviors and its hormones
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:51.440]   and its physiologies as a scientist.
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:53.700]   And so I think that's to be clear what we're doing here,
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:58.700]   we're exploring these behaviors from that perspective.
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:00.800]   I mean, one thing is for certain,
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.520]   everyone is here because a sperm met an egg,
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:06.080]   either in a dish or in vivo, as we said before.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:10.000]   And at least in 2021, there's no way around that fact.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:10.840]   - Yeah.
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:14.560]   - And what preceded that is typically this act we call sex.
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.440]   And sometimes, hopefully, I like to think,
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.240]   orgasm is associated with that sexual activity.
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:23.860]   Masturbation as one dimension of that
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:26.660]   is something that I think can and should be discussed
[02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:29.260]   if in fact there are data that relate it to sleep.
[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:31.160]   - Yeah, and both of those routes
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.600]   seem to lead to a sleep benefit.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:37.740]   Now, I'm not saying that it's all about the orgasm.
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:40.720]   I think as we spoke about with oxytocin,
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:43.420]   there is some degree of per bonding
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:47.020]   that if you have a partner and you experience
[02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:51.440]   an intimate loving relationship that involves that,
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:56.120]   then you can have hormonal benefits that are sleep promoting
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.400]   that may not necessarily be seen if you're just engaging
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:03.820]   in the solo singular act of masturbation.
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:06.100]   So what we certainly know,
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:08.800]   and I am not someone to take any advice on
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.480]   when it comes to anything relationship-wise or sex-wise.
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:13.920]   - That's a different episode of the podcast.
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, certainly.
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:16.520]   And that's not a podcast series
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.440]   that I'm going to be releasing anytime soon.
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:20.160]   It's going to be mostly about sleep,
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:21.500]   although I will touch on,
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:23.880]   I'll release a podcast on sleep and sex.
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:27.040]   But that's the data that we have so far.
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.360]   We also know that it works both ways though,
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:33.040]   and it's commonly the same way with sleep,
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:35.960]   you know, sleep and exercise, sleep and diet.
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:39.680]   How you eat can affect how you sleep.
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:41.700]   How you sleep can affect how you eat.
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:43.040]   Same with exercise.
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.160]   And it turns out it's the same way with sexual behavior too.
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.380]   So here we're talking about whether sex can help with sleep.
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:54.480]   Can sleep help with your relationship and sex?
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:56.660]   And the answer is yes, it can.
[02:40:56.660 --> 02:40:59.220]   Firstly, we know, and we've spoken a little bit about this,
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:00.840]   that the reproductive hormones
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:02.700]   are under profound sleep regulation.
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:04.180]   - Both estrogen and testosterone.
[02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:05.560]   - Estrogen, testosterone.
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:07.760]   - We hear so often about testosterone,
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:10.600]   but women who, or I should say anyone who's interested
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:12.520]   in having higher levels of estrogen
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:15.340]   or normal healthy levels of estrogen,
[02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:18.120]   I presume the data show for estrogen
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.360]   what the data also show similarly for testosterone,
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.920]   which is if you get too little or poor quality of sleep,
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:26.880]   both sex steroid hormones as they're referred to,
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:28.640]   testosterone, crammed estrogen,
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:30.240]   which are present in both males and females
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:31.880]   and every variation thereof,
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:34.480]   are going to be diminished below normal healthy levels.
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:38.280]   - Estrogen, testosterone, FSH in women,
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:41.580]   a key hormone in the regulation for,
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:44.940]   key for conception, of course.
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:46.840]   All of these sex hormones
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:50.020]   seem to become significantly disrupted
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:54.680]   when sleep becomes of short quantity or poor quality.
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:56.400]   We also know that in women,
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.880]   sleep disruption can usually lead
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:01.760]   to menstrual cycle disruption.
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:04.560]   We know this particularly from evidence in shift working
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:07.480]   women where they are nighttime shift workers,
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:09.520]   they struggle with sleep during the day.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.520]   Often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes impaired.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:17.240]   But we also know it works this way,
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:22.240]   not just for sex hormones, but for sex itself.
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.960]   For example, we found that for every one hour of sleep,
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:28.840]   extra sleep that a woman gets,
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:32.320]   her interest in becoming sexually intimate with her partner
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:37.320]   increases by 14%, which is a non trivial amount.
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:39.800]   And then the final part of,
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:43.640]   I think this equation when it comes to sleep and sex
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:47.520]   is your relationship itself.
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.880]   And there's some great work here from UC Berkeley
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:52.560]   by Professor Serena Chen.
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:55.760]   And what she found was that restless nights
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:59.880]   mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship.
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:02.740]   And they did this in a number of different elegant ways
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:04.240]   and vice versa as well.
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:06.880]   - I mean, not that I've ever had conflict in relationships.
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:09.360]   - Me like, I just, this is just data I've read,
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:11.120]   I've never experienced that at all.
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:16.080]   So they found reliably that sleep would predict
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:19.640]   higher likelihood of relationship conflict.
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:22.240]   Secondly, if you got into that conflict,
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:25.800]   the chances of you resolving it were significantly lower
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:28.880]   when the parties had not been sleeping well.
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.280]   Part of the reason is because when you're not well slept,
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:35.440]   your empathy goes down.
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:39.640]   So you're not, you're taking more of an abrasive stance
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.220]   with your partner rather than a more agreeable stance
[02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:44.520]   with your partner.
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:46.840]   So at almost every dimension
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:50.220]   of a human loving relationship,
[02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:53.120]   sleep can have a dramatic impact.
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:55.720]   - I think these are really important things to underscore.
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.420]   One of the most common questions I get,
[02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:01.020]   because there seems to be a community of people
[02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:03.440]   on the internet that are obsessed with this.
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:05.500]   I don't know who they are because it's all,
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:07.420]   all this internet stuff is shouting into a tunnel
[02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:08.960]   and getting comments back in written form.
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:13.480]   It's a very bizarre conversation, so to speak,
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.940]   is whether or not sexual behavior itself
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:19.720]   lowers or increases testosterone.
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.720]   And I went into the data, which spans many decades actually,
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:26.580]   both animal studies and human studies.
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:28.640]   And it seems just to underscore this,
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.200]   as long as we're talking about the subject,
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:34.640]   that it does seem that sexual activity,
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:36.920]   sex between two people
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.060]   does seem to increase testosterone in both.
[02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:45.700]   There is this question about orgasm or no orgasm,
[02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:47.440]   ejaculation, no ejaculation.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:50.040]   And indeed, there do seem to be some effects
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.360]   of restricting ejaculation in males
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:57.080]   as a form of further increasing testosterone.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:00.260]   So sex without ejaculation, further increasing testosterone.
[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:02.780]   But the data are not clean,
[02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:05.160]   presumably because organizing these sorts of studies
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:06.880]   and getting truth in self-reporting
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.680]   is probably hard to get from subjects.
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.480]   But everything sort of points in the direction
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:19.240]   that provided that the relationship is a healthy one,
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:20.800]   it's consensual, it's age-appropriate,
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:22.800]   context-appropriate, species-appropriate,
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:24.100]   that sex between two individuals
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.580]   does seem to increase the sex steroid hormones,
[02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:29.140]   testosterone and estrogen, toward healthy ranges.
[02:45:29.140 --> 02:45:30.680]   And what I'm hearing now,
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:33.000]   the sort of gestalt of the discussion we just had,
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.080]   is that that too can promote sleepiness,
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:40.040]   restful states, and quality sleep.
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:42.960]   And I think this is an important conversation
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:44.500]   that just hasn't been held enough.
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:47.280]   I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and elsewhere,
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:48.720]   we're going to have to acknowledge
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:51.280]   that we are biological organisms of some sort,
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:54.940]   and that we have choice in life about all these things,
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:57.640]   from supplementation to sex or no sex, et cetera,
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.060]   but that they have profound effects on our core biology.
[02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:04.400]   I mean, it's fascinating to me
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:06.140]   that the areas of the hypothalamus,
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:08.480]   the preoptic area, the superoptic areas,
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:11.400]   those areas which the names might not mean anything
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:13.840]   to anybody besides Matt and I sitting here,
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:16.900]   but those areas sit cheek to jowl with each other
[02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:20.620]   in the hypothalamus and control sleep and sex.
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:24.840]   The trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food,
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:26.840]   the appetite for water, for electrolytes.
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:31.840]   I mean, the hypothalamus is kind of a festival of neurons
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:35.160]   with different booths for different primitive behaviors.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:36.780]   - It's such a small, small structure in the brain,
[02:46:36.780 --> 02:46:38.280]   but it's the orchestrator
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:41.700]   of a vast number of our behaviors disproportionate
[02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:43.600]   in terms of its size versus effect.
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:44.720]   - Yeah, I don't think you can go
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:46.140]   to this hypothalamic festival
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:48.920]   without at least seeing all the booths,
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:50.280]   whether or not you decide to visit them or not.
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:51.560]   - Oh, I love that.
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:53.420]   Master analogy there.
[02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:58.420]   - So I'm glad that we've broached that conversation,
[02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:01.720]   and I hope people will think that we've approached it
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:03.360]   with the appropriate level of sensitivity.
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:05.920]   It's an important one that we're going to hear more about
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:06.760]   one way or the other.
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:08.000]   People are certainly thinking about this,
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.440]   if not engaging in these sorts of behaviors
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:11.800]   or avoiding them.
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:14.560]   So the more we can understand about the biology, the better.
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:15.960]   - I'll say.
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.880]   - And so thank you for bringing that topic up
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:20.920]   because for the record, Matt tabled it for discussion.
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:22.040]   [laughing]
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:24.180]   - I said, we were just like chatting outside,
[02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:26.680]   and I think we'd said something about sex,
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:27.960]   and I said, yeah, we can go there.
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:29.400]   That's actually interesting data.
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:30.320]   - Absolutely.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:35.240]   I want to touch on just two remaining topics.
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:40.240]   One is, are there any unconventional sleep tips
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:42.880]   or things about sleep that we've overlooked?
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:44.840]   If we've covered everything, great.
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:47.700]   But we're here to keep the room cool.
[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:50.680]   We're here because of this temperature phenomenon,
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:53.720]   the light aspects, the considerations about alcohol,
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:57.800]   CBD, marijuana, cognitive behavioral,
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.440]   tart cherry fruit, kiwis, perhaps.
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:03.680]   - Please don't put me on the hook for tart cherries and kiwi.
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:05.080]   I was just offering what I know about them.
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:06.800]   - No, and these are considerations
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:09.480]   and whether or not people batch these things.
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:10.860]   I won't even list them off now
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:13.560]   because there are too many jokes that one could make.
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.320]   - And I have no affiliation with any of these products
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:18.600]   or companies or whatever. - Well, I'm going to take out
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:19.800]   stock in a kiwi company.
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.480]   No, I'm just kidding.
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:26.440]   But the question I have is about any unconventional
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:28.700]   or lesser known things, or maybe you do things
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:32.840]   or you think about things just in a purely exploratory way
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:37.220]   as a scientist, the what-if kind of things,
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:40.760]   that what if it turns out that,
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:44.540]   and I hear I've got a blank there for you to fill in.
[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:49.120]   - I think beyond the standard fare
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:52.320]   that I've dished out plenty of times of sleep hygiene,
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.180]   of regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine,
[02:48:57.180 --> 02:48:59.520]   and we've spoken about all of those,
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:03.600]   what are some more unconventional tips, I guess?
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.880]   The first one, which is unconventional
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:07.860]   along the lines of naps,
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:09.880]   if you've had a bad night of sleep,
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:12.840]   let's say that you're starting to emerge with insomnia
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:14.800]   and you've had a bad night of sleep,
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:16.540]   the advice, and I learned this
[02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:20.440]   from my wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis, do nothing.
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:24.640]   What I mean by that is don't wake up any later,
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:27.680]   don't sleep in the following day to try and make up for it.
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:30.520]   Don't nap during the day,
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:33.880]   don't consume extra caffeine to wake you up
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:35.600]   to try to get you through the day,
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:37.900]   and don't go to bed any earlier
[02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:40.780]   to think that you're going to compensate.
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:42.960]   And I can explain all of those things,
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.740]   but if you wake up later,
[02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:47.560]   you're not going to be sleepy until later the evening,
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:49.640]   so you're gonna go to bed at your normal time
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:50.940]   and you won't be sleeping, you'll think,
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:53.600]   "Well, I just came off a bad night of sleep
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:56.980]   "and now I can't even get to sleep
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:58.520]   "and it's my normal time."
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:01.400]   It's because you slept in later than you would otherwise
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:04.680]   and you reduce the window of adenosine accumulation
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:06.600]   before your normal bedtime.
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:09.920]   So don't go, don't wake up any later,
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:12.640]   don't use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:13.880]   because that's only gonna crank you
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:15.380]   and keep you awake the following night
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:17.240]   or decrease the probability
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:19.480]   of a good following night of recovery sleep.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.360]   Third, I mentioned don't take naps
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:25.920]   because once again, that will just take,
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:28.340]   naps particularly later in the afternoon,
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:31.460]   I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal,
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:33.680]   it just takes your appetite off the edge
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:36.380]   of that main meal of sleep, so don't do it.
[02:50:36.380 --> 02:50:39.200]   And then finally, don't go to bed any earlier,
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:42.960]   resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time.
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:45.680]   What I want to try and do is prevent you from thinking,
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:47.440]   "Well, I had such a bad night last night
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:49.140]   "and I normally go to bed at 10.30,
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:51.360]   "I'm just gonna get into bed at nine o'clock
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:53.580]   "because last night was just so bad."
[02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:55.740]   But that's not your natural bedtime
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:58.640]   and it's not aligned with your natural chronotype
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:01.560]   because presumably you kind of know something about that
[02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:02.920]   or morning type, evening type,
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.120]   you're trying to sleep in harmony
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:07.080]   which is usually how you get best quality sleep.
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:08.360]   But you go to bed at nine
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:12.060]   and my body is not ready to sleep at nine o'clock,
[02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:12.960]   but I'm worried
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:14.920]   because I had a bad night of sleep last night,
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:17.680]   so I get into bed and now I'm tossing and turning
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:19.040]   for the first hour and a half
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:21.120]   because it's not my natural sleep window
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:23.200]   but I just thought it was a good idea.
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.460]   And if I didn't know anything about sleep,
[02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:27.720]   I would think all of these same things too.
[02:51:27.720 --> 02:51:29.720]   So I'm not finger wagging,
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:33.360]   but if I have a bad night of sleep and I am not immune,
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:36.000]   just because I know a little bit about sleep
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.840]   doesn't mean I don't have my bad nights, I do.
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:41.360]   Doesn't mean I haven't had bouts of insomnia in my life,
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:42.600]   I have.
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.120]   But after a bad night of sleep, I do nothing.
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:49.480]   I don't do any of those four things.
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:52.280]   I think the second tip I would offer
[02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:53.680]   in terms of unconventional
[02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:56.680]   is have a wind down routine.
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:52:01.680]   Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light switch,
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:04.460]   that we just jump into bed and when we turn the light out,
[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:07.060]   sleep should arrive in that same way.
[02:52:07.060 --> 02:52:09.440]   Just the binary, it's on or it's off.
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.200]   Sleep is a physiological process.
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:13.940]   It's much more like landing a plane.
[02:52:13.940 --> 02:52:16.660]   It takes time to gradually descend down
[02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:18.760]   onto the terra firma of what we call
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:21.060]   good solid sleep at night.
[02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:23.240]   Find out whatever works for you
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:25.320]   and it could be light stretching.
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:30.200]   I usually meditate for about 10 or 15 minutes before bed.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:32.580]   Some people like reading.
[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:34.240]   Try not to watch television in bed.
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:35.080]   That's usually advised against.
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:36.400]   - Something that doesn't emit too much light to your eyes.
[02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:38.560]   - Too much light, too activating.
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:40.560]   You know, you can listen to a relaxing podcast,
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:43.480]   although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too,
[02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:47.280]   but have some kind of a wind down routine.
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:50.560]   It's, you know, it's almost like, you know,
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:53.200]   you wouldn't race into your garage
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:57.740]   and come to a screeching halt from 60 miles an hour.
[02:52:57.740 --> 02:53:00.260]   You typically downshift your gears
[02:53:00.260 --> 02:53:01.800]   and you slow down as you come into the garage.
[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:04.080]   There's the same thing with sleep too.
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:05.120]   So that's the second thing.
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:07.040]   Have some kind of a wind down routine.
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:08.120]   Find what works for you.
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:11.160]   Maybe it's taking a hot bath or a warm shower
[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:12.480]   and then stick to it.
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:14.240]   Just, we do this with kids all the time.
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:16.200]   We find out what their bedroom,
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:18.660]   sorry, their bedtime regiment is
[02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:21.060]   and then we just stick to it faithfully
[02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:24.460]   'cause we humans are the same way too.
[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:26.380]   The third thing is a myth.
[02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:27.900]   Don't count sheep.
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:29.420]   There was a study done here at UC Berkeley.
[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:30.580]   I didn't do this today, I wish I did.
[02:53:30.580 --> 02:53:33.000]   It was by my colleague, Professor Alison Harvey.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.220]   And they found that counting sheep
[02:53:35.220 --> 02:53:37.460]   actually made it harder to fall asleep.
[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:39.240]   It made matters worse.
[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:42.340]   As a counter, sorry, counter measure to that,
[02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:45.140]   what they did find was that taking yourself
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:47.580]   on some kind of a mental walk.
[02:53:47.580 --> 02:53:50.420]   So think about a nice walk that you take in nature
[02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:51.700]   or a walk on the beach
[02:53:51.700 --> 02:53:54.580]   or even a walk around an urban environment
[02:53:54.580 --> 02:53:59.000]   and visualizing that, that seemed to be beneficial.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:02.260]   The other thing about sort of that idea
[02:54:02.260 --> 02:54:06.260]   of shifting focus away from your mind itself,
[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:10.520]   get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice.
[02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:14.240]   Catharsis, you can try to write down
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:16.900]   all of the concerns that you have
[02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:19.240]   and do this not right before bed,
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:21.980]   but usually an hour or two before bed.
[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:24.680]   Some people call it a worry journal.
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:28.020]   And to me, it's a little bit like closing down
[02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:30.600]   all of the emotional tabs on my browser.
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:33.420]   Because if I shut the computer down
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:35.600]   and all of those tabs are still open,
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:36.440]   I'm gonna come back in the morning
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.780]   and the computer's red hot, the fan's going
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:40.580]   because it didn't go to sleep.
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:42.540]   Because it couldn't because there were too many tabs
[02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:43.700]   active and open.
[02:54:43.700 --> 02:54:45.580]   I think it's the same way with sleep as well.
[02:54:45.580 --> 02:54:47.320]   So try to think about doing that.
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:50.660]   So just vomit out all of your concerns on the page.
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:52.540]   - I like that 'cause my 3 a.m. waking
[02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:54.360]   is often associated with me writing down
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:56.980]   the list of things that I forgot to do, that I need to do.
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:01.260]   And once I eventually wake up from the later night,
[02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:03.220]   second half of the night's sleep,
[02:55:03.220 --> 02:55:05.500]   that stuff seems much more tractable and reasonable,
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:08.020]   but it sure would be great to get that stuff
[02:55:08.020 --> 02:55:09.500]   out of the way before sleep.
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:10.620]   - Well, there's also something
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:12.940]   that I don't think people have spoken about a lot
[02:55:12.940 --> 02:55:14.980]   and I'd like to research it,
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:19.980]   which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the dark
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:27.380]   is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day.
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:31.380]   And when we have those thoughts at night,
[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:33.980]   it comes with a magnitude of rumination
[02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:38.540]   and catastrophization that is disproportionate
[02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:41.520]   to that which you would describe when you are awake.
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:47.000]   And I don't know what's going on about the brain
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.540]   and thought and emotion at the time.
[02:55:49.540 --> 02:55:52.340]   I've got a bunch of theories as to why.
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:55.960]   And that's why I like the idea of closing up,
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:58.940]   zipping up all of those different components,
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:03.780]   just get them out on the page and it feel,
[02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:06.340]   and I at first thought, this just sounds like Huey,
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:08.780]   it sounds very Berkeley, it's kind of come by R,
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:12.140]   we all hold hands and walk home at the end of the day.
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:14.520]   But then the data started coming out,
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:16.220]   really good studies from good people.
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:18.740]   And they found that keeping one of those journals
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:22.060]   decreased the time it takes you to fall asleep by 50%, five,
[02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:26.300]   zero, it's well on par with any pharmaceutical agent.
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:27.300]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:29.900]   I'm convinced that, well, I've long thought
[02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:34.100]   that the worries and concerns and ideas I have at three,
[02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:37.420]   four a.m., I've learned to not place any stock in them
[02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:41.140]   because something, I'm glad that you might decide
[02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:43.020]   to eventually look at this in your laboratory
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:46.420]   because I feel like something is melted away or altered.
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:49.920]   I suspect it's in the regulation
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:51.860]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:55.180]   that it makes sense why a concern at three, four a.m.
[02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:59.620]   ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense.
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:01.180]   And certainly that's my experience,
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:03.040]   although I'm fortunate to not suffer
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:04.480]   from full-blown panic attacks,
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:06.940]   but everything seems worse at three, four a.m.,
[02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:07.880]   provided you're awake.
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:09.820]   - And we need to sort of look into that
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:13.060]   because if you look at suicide rates
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:15.460]   around the 24-hour clock face,
[02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:17.480]   disproportionately higher rates
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.100]   in those middle sort of night hours.
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:23.900]   So now I don't know if that's causative or not,
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:26.220]   but something, it could just be that that's the time
[02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:28.440]   when we're mostly lonely and we're by ourselves,
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:29.280]   and that's the reason.
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:31.300]   So it's got nothing to do with sleep or the nighttime.
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:32.140]   I don't know.
[02:57:32.140 --> 02:57:34.480]   So that's the third thing.
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:37.660]   I think the fourth sort of little tip I would give
[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:41.340]   that's unconventional is remove all clock faces
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:42.420]   from your bedroom.
[02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:43.400]   - Including your phone.
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:46.780]   - Including your phone and resist checking it.
[02:57:46.780 --> 02:57:49.860]   Now I know, and I can speak about the phone too,
[02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:52.640]   that genie of technology is out the bottle
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:54.260]   and it's not going back in anytime soon.
[02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:57.540]   So we've got to think as scientists and sleep scientists,
[02:57:57.540 --> 02:58:01.100]   as to what we do with phones in the bedroom.
[02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:03.180]   - Years ago, I was a counselor at a summer camp.
[02:58:03.180 --> 02:58:04.820]   I worked with at-risk kids
[02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:07.100]   and there was a phrase that comes to mind here.
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:09.180]   It's be a channel, not a dam,
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:12.060]   because when you try and dam certain kinds of behavior,
[02:58:12.060 --> 02:58:14.780]   physically dam certain kinds of behavior,
[02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:17.740]   not morally dam, that too,
[02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:23.740]   it just creeps over the edge and you get a waterfall.
[02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:25.300]   So it has to be channeled.
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:27.700]   The phone and devices have to be worked with
[02:58:27.700 --> 02:58:28.740]   and negotiated, not eliminated.
[02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:31.560]   - That's right, and think about those mindfully too,
[02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:34.680]   but clock faces, remove all of those,
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:38.280]   because if you are having a tough night,
[02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:40.600]   knowing that it's 3.22 in the morning,
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:43.140]   or it's 4.48 in the morning,
[02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:46.000]   does not help you in the slightest.
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.960]   And it's only going to make matters worse than better.
[02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:51.560]   So try to remove all clock faces.
[02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:53.360]   And I think that's one of those other tips
[02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:55.260]   that some people have found helpful,
[02:58:55.260 --> 02:58:58.720]   but those would be sort of some slightly unconventional,
[02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:00.920]   I guess, more than your stock fare of,
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:04.040]   here are the five tips for sleep hygiene tonight.
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:06.520]   - Those are terrific sleep tips,
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:08.380]   and several of which, if not all of which,
[02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:09.800]   I'm going to incorporate.
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:14.640]   Matt, this has been an amazing deep dive on sleep
[02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:16.980]   and it's positive and negative regulators.
[02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:18.480]   - I hope it hasn't been too long.
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:20.160]   - No, this has been great.
[02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:22.520]   - Please cut it down, shorten it to, you know,
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:24.840]   the five minutes of meaningful stuff that I offer.
[02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:26.000]   - Absolutely not, absolutely not.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.960]   It is chock-a-block full of valuable takeaways.
[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:32.080]   It's been tremendously fun for me
[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:35.840]   to dissect out this incredible aspect of our lives
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.800]   that we call sleep with a fellow scientist
[02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:39.760]   and a fellow public educator.
[02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:42.320]   I want to say several things.
[02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:46.440]   First of all, we should say where people can find you,
[02:59:46.440 --> 02:59:48.480]   although it shouldn't be that difficult these days.
[02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:51.360]   You're a very present on the internet.
[02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:53.440]   For better or for worse.
[02:59:53.440 --> 02:59:54.960]   I think it's wonderful that you're out there.
[02:59:54.960 --> 02:59:58.600]   Look, it's a public health service that you're doing.
[02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:01.680]   No one requires you or any other scientist to get out.
[03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:04.560]   And share this information.
[03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:07.080]   My sense of you knowing you a bit
[03:00:07.080 --> 03:00:08.640]   and from following your work very closely,
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:10.300]   both your scientific work in detail
[03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:13.400]   and your public facing educational work
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:16.680]   is that you very much want the best for people.
[03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:20.560]   And it's an interesting thing as a scientist or a clinician
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:24.680]   to know that certain answers exist,
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:25.800]   that we don't have all the answers,
[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:27.260]   but that there is a better path.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:29.000]   There are better ways and people can benefit
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.440]   in a myriad of ways.
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:34.320]   So for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you,
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:36.680]   you want the best for people
[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:41.160]   and you're offering tremendous advice and considerations
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:42.520]   and people can take it or leave it.
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:43.580]   That's the way I view it.
[03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:45.700]   I also want to thank you for taking the time out of your day
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:49.560]   to sit with me here and have this discussion.
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:50.640]   - It's a privilege.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:51.800]   It's a delight.
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:55.520]   You and I, I think we're like kind in lots of ways.
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:59.600]   And I take you as a shining example
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:03.640]   of how you can effectively connect with the public.
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:05.680]   And I know that we've had our conversations
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:07.560]   before we ever sat down sort of together
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:12.200]   about how to think about communicating with the public
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:14.240]   and the pros and cons of that.
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:16.460]   And I've just loved your opinions.
[03:01:16.460 --> 03:01:18.520]   I've been drinking it all in.
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:21.560]   And then I think the third thing I'd like to say is,
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:25.280]   thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador.
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:27.720]   The series that you've released on sleep,
[03:01:27.720 --> 03:01:29.220]   the way that you speak about sleep,
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:33.040]   the way that you moderate and have championed sleep,
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:34.720]   it is remarkable.
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:39.720]   So thank you for just being a brother in arms in that way.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:43.240]   - Well, we are, and thanks for those words.
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:45.960]   99% of what I discussed there was the work of you
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:47.560]   and your colleagues in the sleep field.
[03:01:47.560 --> 03:01:49.640]   So proper acknowledgement, but thank you.
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:52.000]   Where can people learn more
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.800]   about what you're doing currently and what's coming next?
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:56.000]   You're on Twitter.
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.360]   - I am on Twitter.
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:00.440]   I typically tweet.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:01.640]   - As the sleep diplomat.
[03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:03.940]   - So it's, no, it's just sleep diplomat.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:04.940]   - Sleep diplomat.
[03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:09.940]   - Sleep diplomat on Twitter, sleepdiplomat.com website.
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:13.360]   If you want to learn more about the science that we do here,
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:16.280]   it's humansleepscience.com.
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:18.900]   It's the Center for Human Sleep Science.
[03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:23.980]   You can pick up a copy of the book if you want.
[03:02:23.980 --> 03:02:25.600]   It's called "Why We Sleep."
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:27.520]   If you're curious about sleep,
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:29.400]   that's one path to take and it's my view.
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:32.000]   - Is there another book someday in the future?
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.480]   - I think there may be.
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:35.000]   Yeah, I think there are.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:36.560]   - Many, many millions of people
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:38.040]   will be very happy to hear that.
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:40.440]   - I think it's starting to take hold.
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:43.040]   And then as we discussed,
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:46.680]   I am more than kicking around the idea
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:49.700]   of a short form podcast rather than a long form.
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:53.600]   Not long form because I don't have the mental capacity
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:57.520]   or the interviewing just capability
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:02:59.080]   that someone like you has.
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:01.380]   So it will probably just be monologue short form.
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:05.120]   So if there is some interest, I'll probably do that as well.
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:07.280]   So those are the ways that people can find me.
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:10.520]   But overall, if you're interested in sleep,
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:12.160]   just listen to Andrew.
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.000]   That's the best thing I can tell people.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.480]   - All right, well, now we're batting back and forth
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:19.660]   the vector of action, so to speak.
[03:03:19.660 --> 03:03:22.260]   But I do hope you'll start a podcast,
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:25.800]   however brief or lengthy these episodes turn out to be,
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:27.560]   because I do believe that's a great venue
[03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:29.480]   to get information out into the world.
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.360]   And we don't just want to hear more from Matt Walker.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.260]   I speak for many people.
[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:36.100]   We need to.
[03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:38.660]   The work you're doing is both influential,
[03:03:38.660 --> 03:03:41.700]   but more importantly, it is important work.
[03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:44.880]   It has the impact that's needed,
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:47.860]   especially in this day and age where science and medicine,
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:51.460]   public health, and the issues of the world, et cetera,
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:52.360]   are really converging.
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:56.120]   So I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:03:58.400]   and I just say thank you for doing the work you do
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:03:59.720]   and for being you.
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:01.320]   And thanks for being a good friend.
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:02.800]   - Likewise, too.
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:05.680]   And by the way, I just going to note that it was nice
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:10.380]   that the two of us both got the Johnny Cash memo
[03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:12.320]   about how to dress today.
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:14.280]   It seems as though we're both kind of,
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:15.600]   we got that same memo,
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:18.080]   which will mean nothing to people who are listening.
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:19.920]   But if you're watching the video,
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:21.180]   you'll probably see what I mean.
[03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:23.020]   Andrew, thank you for taking this time.
[03:04:23.020 --> 03:04:25.060]   Thank you so much. - Thanks so much, Matt.
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:27.100]   - Thank you for joining me for my discussion
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:29.020]   with Dr. Matt Walker.
[03:04:29.020 --> 03:04:32.720]   Please also check out his podcast, The Matt Walker Podcast.

[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:03.420]   Please also check out our sponsors

[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:11.100]   During this episode and in many previous episodes,
[03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:12.640]   we discussed supplements.
[03:05:12.640 --> 03:05:14.260]   One issue in the supplement industry
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:16.640]   is that many supplements don't contain
[03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:18.360]   what's listed on the bottle.
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:20.160]   We therefore have partnered with Thorne,
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:23.160]   that's T-H-O-R-N-E, Thorne supplements,
[03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:25.160]   because Thorne supplements have the highest levels
[03:05:25.160 --> 03:05:28.080]   of stringency in terms of the purity of the ingredients
[03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:31.500]   and precision with respect to what's listed on the bottle
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:34.400]   is actually what's contained in those supplement bottles.
[03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:36.240]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:38.080]   for sleep and for other things,
[03:05:38.080 --> 03:05:42.680]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[03:05:42.680 --> 03:05:45.400]   And there you'll see all the supplements that I take
[03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:47.640]   and can get 20% off any of those supplements
[03:05:47.640 --> 03:05:49.480]   as well as any other supplements
[03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:50.660]   that Thorne happens to make.
[03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:55.660]   That's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, .com/u/huberman.
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:05:59.080]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:05:59.080 --> 03:06:00.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:03.380]   [upbeat music]
[03:06:03.380 --> 03:06:05.960]   (upbeat music)
