[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about building financial independence. Of course,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.320]   we're honoring the US American Independence Day holiday here on July 4. Building financial
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:47.440]   independence in easy stages. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.520]   you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.080]   meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.520]   My name is Joshua. I am your host. I am your guide and I am your fellow financial freedom fighter,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.480]   working and walking with you on the path towards independence, both financial and otherwise.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:22.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I'm going to lean heavily on this idea of independence. Of
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.320]   course, that is a core function of who I am and what I talk about. If I were to place values and
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.000]   priorities, sorry, if I were to share with you a little bit about my own values and priorities,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.760]   I would say that liberty is very, very high on the list. Independence is very, very high on the list.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.920]   I'm sure that that will come through if you have listened to more than about one or two episodes
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   of Radical Personal Finance. I can't imagine that that would be a surprise to you. Those are some of
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.480]   my highest values and I try to practice them and live them out and walk them out. But I've learned
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   that I'm not alone in that. I'm certainly in a minority to the extreme that I take those ideas,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.720]   that I take those concepts, but I'm not a minority in my desire for those things.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.880]   I'm convinced this idea of independence, frankly, is at the foundation of much of finance and much
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.240]   of financial planning. It's expressed in different ways. The country singer sings it in the terms of
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.040]   "Take this job and shove it. I ain't a-workin' here no more." Well, that's one way of expressing
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.120]   financial independence. The retirement planner talks about it in terms of "What would you like
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440]   to do when you retire at 65 years old and what would you live?" And people dream about how they
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.800]   would live out their golden years. That's one way to express it. The fire community talks about this
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.560]   in terms of "In 10 years, I'm going to get independent so I can do what I really want to do."
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.640]   That's one way to express it. The teenager expresses it, "I can't wait to move out of my
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   parents' household until I'm not under their rules." That's another way of expressing it.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.400]   But the theme that's common to all of these things is independence and liberty. And I believe that
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.680]   the desire for liberty and independence beat deeply in the heart of every human breast.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.160]   Now, frequently, there's a whole lot of fat covering up that beating heart, such that many
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.400]   people don't even recognize that it's important to them. But I believe that it is important to
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.960]   many people. Time will tell whether I'm right or not, but I believe that it is important. I believe
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.440]   that it's important to you. Otherwise, why would you tune into a show that's dedicated to helping
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:32.240]   you develop financial freedom, independence? Is that not why you're here? If you wanted to learn
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.400]   how to buy a fancier car, you could find that somewhere else. But you're not listening to the
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.560]   fancier car show, you're listening to the radical personal finance show. If you were looking for
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.160]   how to take millions of dollars by oppressing other people, by staging a government coup,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   and taking all their money away and taxing them, you'd be listening to other shows. Just
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   turn on the TV and you can see that all the time. But you're not there. You're here.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.960]   And so I'm convinced that financial freedom and financial independence are here.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560]   They're important to you. Now, in honor of Independence Day, how could we not begin with
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   that quote from the US Declaration of Independence? The framers and writers of the Declaration of
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480]   Independence wrote these words. They said this, "We hold these truths to be self-evident,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.000]   that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.720]   rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Again, "We hold these
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.560]   truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:02.320]   with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.480]   Now, you clearly have life because you're listening to me.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   So, we don't need to spend too much time on that, except I would strongly beg you and please
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:31.920]   with you to use your life and your mouth to advocate for life for others. To whatever extent
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.600]   that you can, advocate for life for others because all men have the right to live. No matter who they
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.520]   are, no matter what they look like, no matter how old they are, how young they are, how ugly they
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.760]   are, how beautiful they are, whether they hold the same political convictions that are currently
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.640]   en vogue or the same religious ideology that's currently en vogue, all men have the right to
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.280]   life. So, I beg you to please defend others' right to life. But let's talk about number two.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.000]   If this is true, liberty, is it true that all men are created equal and are endowed by their
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.120]   creator with an unalienable right to liberty? An unalienable right is a right that is incapable
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.560]   of being aliened, meaning sold or transferred. An unalienable right is a right that is flat
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.360]   out fundamentally incapable of being surrendered, abridged, changed, revoked in any way.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   Now, if that's true, that means that you today have the right to liberty. So, here's my question.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.920]   If you have the right to liberty, if you are fundamentally free because that right cannot be
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:59.280]   aliened, then why have you sold yourself into slavery through your own actions? Why have you
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   given up that right? Why have you started behaving like a slave instead of taking that right and
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.240]   building on it and exercising it? I've learned over the years that rights, if they're not exercised
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.960]   and practiced vigorously, then frequently they start to be given away. And if you have a right
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.560]   to liberty, and if that right is truly unalienable, then why are you not acting like it?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.240]   I believe you should vigorously practice all of your rights, no matter what they are.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.640]   And today I want to give you just some very short, very clear practical tips to help you
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:56.560]   develop liberty and independence in your finances. Number one, are you earning an income? If not,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:07.040]   why not? The more quickly you can earn and develop an income, that income stream can
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:15.760]   support you and you can experience and enjoy the right to liberty. I frequently think of the young
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.600]   person, perhaps the teenager who says, "I can't wait to get out of this house." Well, what's
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.480]   usually holding them back? It's because they're not earning enough money to support themselves.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.000]   They could get out of the house. They could leave. They could be no longer subject to mom
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.800]   and dad's rules. But the fact is they're not earning an income and they can't support themselves.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.960]   So why don't you start supporting yourself?
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:46.640]   Here's what's even worse. Are you taking an income from someone else without supporting yourself?
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.760]   If so, that means you're giving up your right to liberty. You say, "Oh, I got free money. The
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.040]   money comes in and supports me. It's great." Well, no, it doesn't. You're giving up something in
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:06.240]   exchange for that. You've made a certain bargain and it's frankly a Faustian bargain that you
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:15.840]   shouldn't have entered into and it'll rot your soul. Recently on our family's travels, I had
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.680]   the chance to pass through some rough parts of town. There is nothing more pathetic than a free
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.000]   human being who has sold themselves into slavery just to get a government check.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   It's so pathetic to watch someone who is capable of productivity sit around and behave like a leech.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:51.360]   Don't let that be you. Exercise your right to earn an income. You have the right to work.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.120]   You don't have the right to keep other people from working, but you have the right to work.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:06.480]   So act like it. You have the right to go and to earn an income, to go and to contribute valuable
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.160]   skills to the marketplace and to earn money. It doesn't matter what other people say about your
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   right, your ability to do that or not. You have that right. So go and act like it. Exercise it.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.760]   Earn an income. Bring your skills to the marketplace and see who wants to bid on them.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   Bring your products to the marketplace and see who wants to buy them.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.200]   Ignore all the rest of the stuff, all the people telling you don't have that right.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.960]   You do have that right. Nobody has the right to take away from you your right to work.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:46.160]   You have the liberty to work. And once you can work, once you can develop yourself
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.440]   so that you have that income, well, now you have choices. You can experience liberty.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.840]   I just traveled through the South and then traveling through the South, I was thinking a
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:05.520]   lot about the heritage of slavery, of chattel slavery. One of the things that's so disgusting
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:14.480]   about slavery is fundamentally the slave owners were selling somebody's work.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.920]   When a slave owner went to a slave auction and bought a human slave,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.960]   they were buying that person's body, but ultimately they were buying that person's work.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.240]   When they sold a slave, ultimately what they were selling is they were selling that person's work.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:42.080]   You have the right to work. What good is it to end human chattel slavery in the United States
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.400]   of America only to substitute a looser bondage of slavery that keeps people from working?
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.520]   What good is it to implement other laws and regulations saying who can work and who can't?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.160]   Why bother ending slavery in that case? You have the right to work. And fundamentally,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:10.000]   you have the right to own the fruit of your labors. You have the right to enjoy the fruit
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.280]   of your labors. You don't have to take it to Massa and give him all the money. You have the right to
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   own the fruit of your labors, so act like it. Now, you don't have the right to go and take
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   from other people, but you have the right to work. And if you will work, you will develop
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.960]   independence for yourself. If you desire a financial independence, you will have to work.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.120]   Now, while you're working, seek to work in a way that allows you to express the fullness
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   of your independence. Seek to work in a place where you can work with integrity.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:51.280]   What good does it do you to become financially rich and to sell your soul just so you can work
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.320]   somewhere that pays you a lot of money, but where you have to give up your integrity?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   You don't have to do that. You can work and get rich and also still be able to look yourself in
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.840]   the mirror a few decades from now by knowing that you have lived and behaved and acted and worked
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:20.400]   with integrity. All work is honorable as long as it contributes to a positive human condition.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.760]   So, don't engage in work that requires you to sell your soul to the devil,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.560]   that requires you to sacrifice your integrity, to sacrifice your principles.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:40.480]   Engage in work that is meaningful and productive and that you can do in principled integrity.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.000]   But if you will work and you'll develop income,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.240]   develop skills that are valuable in the marketplace, you will acquire independence.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.520]   Is there anything that you can't do, any life choice that you can't make if you can just develop
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:07.200]   income? If you can work, it's all open to you. So, take advantage of it.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.720]   Now, once you're working and once you're developing income,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.240]   if you're interested in independence, financial independence, get control of your expenses.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.800]   Don't let your expenses control you. Sit down, figure out what your expenditures are,
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.640]   and get control of them. There are many tools you can use, but frankly,
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.920]   you don't need someone else's tools. Design your own. But get control of your expenses.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.640]   What good does it do you to earn income, but then to have it all fly out of your pockets
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.240]   and other people's pockets without any knowledge or understanding or any attention to where it's
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:53.120]   going or to whom it's going? Pay attention, focus, get control of your expenses. Because it's one
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.960]   thing to be able to work, but if you don't control your expenses, you'll never be wealthy.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.440]   And if you don't actually have accumulated capital, i.e. savings, i.e. money,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   then you'll always be stuck in a day-to-day existence.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:14.880]   What good is it to you to go out from a place of slavery, working on one million dollars a month,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.160]   working on one man's plantation, where that man controls your livelihood, controls your body,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:30.240]   controls your work, but gives you some food, a house, when he feels like it, doesn't beat you
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.360]   too often? What good does it do you to go off of that plantation and to now have the right to go
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.040]   out in the open market and bid your labor, only to find yourself continually in search of another
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.200]   person's plantation to live on? Only to find yourself continually in search of a little bit
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.240]   more that you can buy because you don't have any property of your own? Now, you may have to start
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.840]   there. You may have to develop that income, but develop the income and then get control of your
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.800]   expenses so you can build savings. If you will control your expenses, you can achieve financial
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   independence and financial liberty. So here are some thoughts on helping you control your expenses.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:16.800]   First, get control of yourself. Get control of your emotions. Get control of your desires.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:26.000]   And don't let your inexhaustible desires have full reign of your finances.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:35.520]   It is impossible for you to earn enough money to satisfy all of your desires
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.080]   if you don't get control of your desires. To get control of your desires, you're going to have to
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   exercise virtue, self-discipline, self-control. You're going to have to learn how to place
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.680]   limits on yourself and how to live and abide by those limits. But not living and abiding by those
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:06.320]   limits is what leads you back into slavery, what leads you back into bondage. If you let your eyes
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.880]   look around and see all the nice things that you can buy, if you'll just sign up for a series of
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:19.360]   payments, well, guess what? You'll be making those payments for years. You know, I don't spend much
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.640]   time in the hood and I don't spend much time in cultures that are just really financially
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:33.040]   destroyed. And it's to my own shame that I don't spend more time there because it often
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.000]   puts me in a situation where I just don't understand. I don't get it. But I was driving
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.240]   through the deep South and I had to stop and get some mechanical work done on my trailer.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.000]   And I was driving by this thing I've never seen before. Now, I've seen rent-a-center stores.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.200]   I've seen places where you can go and rent to own, rent a TV or rent a couch and that kind of thing.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.320]   I've never actually been inside one, I'm just aware they exist. I don't get why you would do
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.520]   that when you can just find all that stuff for free on the side of the road, but whatever,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:14.800]   I get that those things exist. But I drove past a rent-a-wheel store and a rent-a-tire store.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   And I thought, are you kidding me? I had no idea this actually exists.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:27.600]   Payday loan stores, I understand why they exist, but rent-a-wheel? And by rent-a-wheel,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.520]   it wasn't referring to rent, wheel being a metaphor for a vehicle. It wasn't rent a vehicle.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:40.080]   It wasn't a rental car place. It was rent a wheel, rent a rim, rent a shiny rim for your car.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:48.320]   Now, that's a level of stupidity that I'm not often exposed to. And I was pretty
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:56.240]   shocked by it. But how could anybody do this? Well, how stupid is that? That your desire is
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:05.120]   to have a fancy wheel or a tire for your car. And I'm judging by external appearance. I didn't go in
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.400]   and talk to them, but everything was all about the fancy flashy wheels that you would rent the wheels
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:18.640]   for your car. I can make a lot of arguments for some seemingly not so good financial decisions,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.520]   pretty good at justifying things. I can find arguments and I'm always looking for the other
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.600]   side. I can always say, "Well, you know, hey, listen, this is the reason why it makes sense
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.960]   to do this certain thing." But I can't come up with any arguments to rent a wheel
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:42.800]   or rent a set of rims. That's pretty bad. But yet, if you want those rims and you just feel
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:52.480]   like you have to satisfy that lust for rims, well, it's going to put you in bondage.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.280]   So, get control of your expenses and start by getting control of your desires.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:05.360]   Take action to change your desires. You can develop a desire for anything. I look at those
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:11.520]   wheels, the big rims wheels, and the low profile tires and things like that. I look at them and I
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.360]   say, "Oh, man, I would not want those on my car. They're expensive to replace." A couple of friends
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.440]   of mine recently, both of them purchased new Dodge Durango SUVs. And I was looking at them and one of
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.040]   them has the sport package, which has a low profile tires. And one of them didn't have the low profile
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.280]   tires. I understand there's a time and a place for low profile tires, but for me, just driving the
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.840]   thing around, I don't want low profile tires. I don't care if the rim is two inches bigger. That
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.040]   means that every single time I have to fix my tires, I have to go to a much smaller selection
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.640]   of stores that has the size of tires. Now, this is a cultivated taste, by the way. I don't think
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.240]   my friend that bought them even noticed. They just, that was what was available for sale.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   But this is a cultivated taste. Some people want low profile tires. Some people want big tires.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.200]   You can buy a pickup truck. You can take that same pickup truck and some people cultivate a
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   desire for a big lifted up pickup truck with big tires. Some people cultivate a desire for a slammed
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.400]   down pickup truck with big tires. Some people cultivate a desire for a pickup truck that's
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.200]   slammed down with little tires and big wheels that has hydraulics and bounces up and down.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.160]   Some people cultivate a desire for pickup trucks that haul heavy loads.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   They're all the same pickup truck. Those desires are cultivated. They're part of the culture that
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.960]   somebody comes from, but they're not coming internally. If they were coming internally,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:37.360]   then there wouldn't be such an obvious stereotype that's clearly visible as to why this person has
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.640]   this culture, this desire. You can cultivate a desire for things that are old or things that
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.840]   are new. You can cultivate a desire for things that are flashy or things that are not flashy.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.400]   I've cultivated a desire for things that are not flashy. I don't want to stand out. I don't want
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.520]   somebody to look at my stuff and notice me twice. But some people go the exact opposite. They want
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.160]   something that's flashy. That's fine. You're a free person. I'm not telling you you can't do that.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.160]   My point is that you cultivate that desire. You can cultivate that. So get control of your desires.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:22.080]   Practically get control of your expenses. Reject contracts. Reject the easy deal and fight for
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.200]   just fair wages, fair service. Get control of your expenses and buying equipment to provide
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.320]   for yourself instead of renting it. Now, I don't know where the line is, but for some people, maybe
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.560]   if you can provide water from your own property, you may not need to be hooked up to the grid.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.000]   We might at least have a backup option. Or if you can own your own housing instead of renting it,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.880]   maybe that would be wise for you. If you can own your source of electricity instead of renting it
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   and buying it for someone else, maybe that would be a desire for you. At least all those transactions
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.160]   are voluntary transactions. A company is providing a service, i.e. electricity or water or whatever,
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   and they're offering you the ability to participate in that. That's fine. But whatever
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:08.480]   possible, do what you can to own your own expenses and save money. You'll save money.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.840]   You can develop freedom. You can develop independence. And the amount of money that
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.480]   you need to save is really very small. Two-thirds of the U.S. American population can't put their
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:30.320]   hands on a thousand dollars when facing an emergency without borrowing it. I repeat,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:36.400]   about two-thirds of the U.S. American population can't put their hands on a thousand dollars for
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   an emergency without borrowing it. What that means is, if you can't put your hands on a thousand
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:52.560]   dollars in an emergency, then you're left as a beggar. Going to a financing company and saying,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.680]   "Please, Massa, will you please give me some money?" Going to your employer and saying,
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.640]   "Please, boss, will you please give me an advance on my paycheck?" Going to a friend and saying,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.360]   "Please, friend, will you please lend me some money?" Don't do it. Save some money.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:19.120]   Work, control your expenses, and save money. It's easy to save money. You know how you do it?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.880]   You go to the ATM, or you cash a check, and you take money, and you put it in an envelope,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:30.400]   and you put it in your desk drawer, and you don't spend it. That's it. That's all it takes.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.880]   And if you're saving a thousand bucks, that's exactly what you should do.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.160]   Just don't spend it. Just save the money and don't spend it.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.600]   And then go from there, and build up more and more and more.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.880]   And if you'll keep going,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:04.240]   then you can tell your boss, "Hey, take this job and shove it. I ain't a-workin' here no more."
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:12.800]   Now, in closing, listen to me carefully. I've used some strong language. I've used some vivid
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:20.640]   metaphors. I've tried to incite you emotionally just a little bit in today's podcast.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.680]   And why have I done that? I've done it intentionally because what I have seen and observed
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.960]   is independence. The desire for financial independence usually seems to begin with
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:49.920]   emotion. You have to have a reason. What good is it to you to be freed from somebody trying to
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   take your wages, somebody trying to take your liberty, to take your life, if you don't actually
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.640]   start doing something with it? Most of us have just been lulled to sleep by our circumstances.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.080]   So, I'm trying to trigger you, to incite you just a little bit,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.240]   to get a little bit disgusted with your situation.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:19.840]   Here's an interesting task. How much money have you earned in the last 10 years?
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.360]   How much money? Think about it. Let's say that your income is, let's just go with a little bit
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.160]   under the median household income of $50,000 per year by 10 years. It's $500,000. So, let's just
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.200]   assume that you've earned $500,000 in the last 10 years. What do you have to show for it?
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.240]   You've earned a million dollars in the last 10 years. That's not hard to do,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.680]   100,000 a year, 10 years. What do you have to show for it?
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:02.640]   How about the last 20 years, last 30 years?
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:13.120]   What do you have to show for it? Now, you do the accounting and the reckoning yourself.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.760]   I don't need to know the numbers. I've got to ask myself that same question, and I do, and I am.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.600]   But ask yourself that question, what do I have to show for it? Here's what's ridiculous.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:39.280]   Many of us have chosen the places that we work. Many of us have chosen the places that we live.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   Many of us have chosen the type of work we do. Many of us have chosen the expenses
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.280]   that we have, the things we've bought, the things we've done. We've chosen all these things insofar
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.160]   as nobody has put a bullwhip to our back and said, "You have to do this."
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   Nobody has threatened us with the point of a gun and said, "You have to do this."
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.560]   And yet, we're not all that much better off than if somebody had.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:22.480]   Is that not pretty sad and ridiculous? To have liberty, true liberty, and not use it?
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   Do you know how many millions of people, nay, billions of people throughout human history,
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:39.120]   would slap you silly for your actions, knowing what they have endured?
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.720]   Don't waste and squander the opportunities that you have. Here's what's funny about that job. I
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.600]   think I'll close, I'll play it. It's a funny old country song. But here's what's funny and what's
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.160]   sad about songs like "Take Your Job" and "Shove It." When you listen to the lyrics,
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.720]   what you'll find is the mess is all of the man's own making.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:12.320]   All the things that he was working for, "Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.400]   no more. My woman done left and took all the reasons I was working for."
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.120]   Those things he's working for, they're all optional. He chose them.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.160]   What are the other lyrics of the song where it goes and talks about,
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.800]   "I've seen a lot of good folk die who had a lot of bills to pay.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.880]   I'd give the shirt right off of my back if I had the guts to say." That's my point.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.320]   There's a, that's my point. The point is that it's a decision.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.400]   You've got to get emotionally ticked off about where you are if you're in a bad space
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   or about how much further you can go and then take it and go with it.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:01.760]   My hope to you is that you can build tremendous financial stability and tremendous financial
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:08.160]   independence. But it starts with the decision to be free. You can say to your boss today,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.600]   "Take this job and shove it," if you have the right attitude and you can go on.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.160]   So, start building it. Build a lifestyle and a livelihood and an income source for yourself
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.920]   that doesn't cause you to be, to have to prostrate yourself at the feet of other people.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.360]   That doesn't cause you to have to suppress what you think and believe.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:34.800]   And build a lifestyle that's independent, that's resilient. I don't think, one point
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.280]   of clarification, you can't do it on your own. We're all engaged with one another,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.800]   but you can build a lifestyle that helps you to be more independent. And on this Independence Day,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.240]   I hope that you'll do that. Get control of your expenses because frankly, you already have the
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.960]   income that you need. And if you're not enjoying the independence of being wealthy and having
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.920]   savings, it's because you're spending too much money. So, stop. Just stop and save money.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:04.240]   And I think if you'll do those things, really, you don't have to wait and wish that you had
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:12.320]   the guts to say it. Just say it, just like this. Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   no more. A woman done left and took all the reason I was working for. You better not try to stand in
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:34.080]   my way as I'm walking out the door. Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here no more.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:48.400]   I've been working in this factory for now 15 years. All this time I watched my woman drowning
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:56.720]   in a pool of tears. And I've seen a lot of good folk die and had a lot of bills to pay.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.680]   I'd give the shirt right off of my back if I had the guts to say,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.720]   "Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here no more."
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:21.760]   A woman done left and took all the reason I was working for. You better not try to stand in my
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:31.840]   way as I'm walking out the door. Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here no more.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:40.480]   Well, that foreman, he's a really dog. The line boss, he's a fool.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.360]   Got a brand new flat-top haircut. Lord, he thinks he's cool.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:56.160]   One of these days I'm gonna blow my top and that sucker, he's gonna pay. Lord,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:04.960]   I can't wait to see their faces when I get the nerve to say, "Take this job and shove it.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:15.040]   I ain't working here no more." A woman done left and took all the reason I was working for.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.160]   You better not try to stand in my way as I'm walking out the door.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:34.640]   Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here no more. Take this job and shove it.
