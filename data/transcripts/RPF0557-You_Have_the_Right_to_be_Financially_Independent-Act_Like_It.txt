[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:36.680]   I'm going to lean heavily on this idea of independence.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   Of course, that is a core function of who I am and what I talk about.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680]   If I were to place values and priorities,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.680]   sorry, if I were to share with you a little bit about my own values and priorities,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.960]   I would say that liberty is very, very high on the list.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   The other thing that I would say is that liberty is very, very high on the list.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:22.280]   and I try to practice them and live them out and walk them out.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   But I've learned that I'm not alone in that.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   I'm certainly in a minority to the extreme that I take those ideas, that I take those concepts,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   but I'm not a minority in my desire for those things.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   I'm convinced this idea of independence frankly is not a minority.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   I'm convinced this idea of independence frankly is not a minority in my desire for those things.

[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.420]   is at the foundation of much of finance and much of financial planning.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.880]   It's expressed in different ways.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.280]   The country singer sings it in the terms of "Take this job and shove it."
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.760]   "I ain't a-workin' here no more."
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.400]   Well, that's one way of expressing financial independence.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.360]   The retirement planner talks about it in terms of "What would you like to do when you retire at 65 years old,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.760]   and what would you live and people dream about how they would live out their golden years?"
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.600]   That's one way to express it.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   The fire community talks about this in terms of
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   The fire community talks about this in terms of
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:20.600]  , "In 10 years I'm going to get independent so I can do what I really want to do."
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   That's one way to express it.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   The teenager expresses it, "I can't wait to move out of my parents' household until I'm not under their rules."
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   That's another way of expressing it.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   But the theme that's common to all of these things is independence and liberty.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   And I believe that the desire for liberty and independence beat deeply in the heart of every human breast.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   I believe that there's a whole lot of fat covering up that beating heart.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   I believe that's a lot of fat covering up that beating heart.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   I believe that's heart that heart that's heart is a lot of every human heart.

If you were looking for how to take millions of dollars by oppressing other people, by staging a government coup and taking all their money away and taxing them, you'd be listening to other shows. Just turn on the TV and you can see that all the time, but you're not there. You're here. And so I'm convinced that financial
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   the
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   financial freedom and financial independence are a fundamental part of the way we live in the world.

[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   Now in honor of Independence Day, how could we not begin with that quote from the U.S. Declaration of Independence? The framers and writers of the Declaration of Independence wrote these words. They said this:

No matter who they are, no matter what they look like, no matter how old they are, how young they are, how ugly they are, how beautiful they are, whether they hold the same political convictions that are currently in vogue, or the same religious ideology that's currently in vogue, all men have the right to life.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   Now is that true that means that you today have the right to liberty.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   So here's my question if you have the right to Liberty.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   If you are fundamentally free because that right cannot be a lien.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Then why.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Have you sold yourself and the flavor.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:40.540]   in a way that's not a right.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   So you have the right to liberty.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   So you have the right to liberty.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:08:03.580]   and if that right is truly on a leanable.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.580]   And if that right is truly on a leanable.

[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.840]   facing an emergency without borrowing it.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.840]   I repeat, about two thirds of the US
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   American population can't put their
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   hands on $1,000 for an emergency without

[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   What that means is, if you can't put
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   your hands on a $1,000 emergency, you
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.220]   can't put your hands on a $1,000 emergency.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:58.220]   What that means is, if you can't put your hands on a $1,000 emergency, you can't put your hands on a $1,000 emergency without borrowing it.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:28.260]  , then you're left as a beggar.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:28.260]   Go to a financing company and saying, "Please, Massa, will you please give me some money?"
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:28.260]   Go to your employer and saying, "Please, boss, will you please give me an advance on my paychecks?"
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:58.300]   I repeat, about two thirds of the US American population can't put their hands on an emergency without borrowing it.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   That's it. That's all it takes. If you're saving $1,000, that's exactly what you should do. Just don't spend it. Just save the money and don't spend it.
