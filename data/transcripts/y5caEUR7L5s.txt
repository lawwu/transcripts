[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   We get a slew of questions from listeners from Indiana to India.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440]   And this one comes from a listener named Ruby in Jaipur.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.920]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.520]   Thank you for your sermons and for this podcast.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.220]   I got married recently and here in India, culturally, a woman
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.240]   lives with the husband's family.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.480]   What would you say about this in light of the multiple times where the Bible
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.960]   talks about a man leaving his parents to become one with his wife?
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.900]   What does this leaving look like in a marriage where he physically doesn't
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.080]   leave his parents' home at all?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.080]   It's risky for me to speak with too much specificity across the miles and across
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.280]   the cultures into a situation that I know very little about culturally.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.720]   So let me see if I can say some foundational things without too many
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.240]   specifics that might nevertheless give some clear guidance in this matter,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.080]   because it really does have relevance.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.560]   This question and the text she's referring to, it really does have
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.080]   relevance to every culture, mine, hers, even though some cultures make this
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   word of Scripture more pressing than others.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   So here's the text.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.040]   In Genesis 2, 23 and 24, Moses writes, just after God created the first
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.160]   woman from Adam's side, he said this.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.800]   Moses said this, "Then the man said, 'This at last is bone of my
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.280]   bone and flesh of my flesh.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.560]   Therefore," here's the key verse, "Therefore, a man shall leave his
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   father and his mother and hold fast," we call it leaving and cleaving,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.160]   "hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   This command to leave mother and father is all the more remarkable because
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.800]   Adam and Eve didn't have any mother-father.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.800]   Moses was taking this moment in the creation story to lay a foundation
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.840]   for all subsequent human life.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.520]   That's very significant.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.440]   And the three things he stresses are, one, leave mother and father; two,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.000]   hold fast or cleave or be united in a new covenant relationship, new covenant
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   relationship, not new covenant relationship, in a new covenant
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.680]   relationship with your spouse; and then third, become one flesh, which
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.800]   includes at least a new intimacy of sexual union, its depth, and all its
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   fruitfulness.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:09.320]   Then Jesus cites this verse, Matthew 19, 5, and Paul quotes this verse in the
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.880]   all-important passage of Ephesians 5, 31 and 32.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.360]   So both Jesus and Paul recognize how foundational this sentence was in
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.440]   Genesis 2:24, and they reaffirm it for their day, I think our day as well.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.280]   So Ruby is right to draw attention to this verse as relevant and indeed
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   urgent, it sounds, for her situation.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   Now, the reason I call Ephesians 5 an all-important passage is because Paul
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.080]   more clearly than anyone in the Bible reveals the mystery that was present
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.000]   there from the beginning in Genesis 2.24, namely, the union of a man and a
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   woman in marriage was modeled on the covenant relationship between
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.680]   Christ and his church.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.640]   Here's the way he says it.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.960]   This is Ephesians 5, 31.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.040]   "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.720]   The two shall become one flesh."
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   This mystery is profound, and I am saying it refers to Christ and the
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.080]   church, and that's what gives such weight and lasting durability to
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   Genesis 2.24.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.240]   So in answer to Ruby's question, Ephesians 5, 23 to 33, that whole unit
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:50.840]   gives the best guidelines to the essence or the heart of what it means to leave
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.000]   mother and father and cleave to each other in marriage.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.440]   And I think if we read it carefully, we can draw out at least four aspects of a
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.840]   marriage relationship that distances it from former participation in the
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.320]   household with mother and father.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.120]   So here they are.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.040]   One, there is now a new allegiance, devotion, affection, intimacy, priority,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.080]   which is clearly implied in the analogy of Christ and the church.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.640]   That's number one, a new allegiance.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.040]   Number two, there is a new structure of responsibility for who bears the primary
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.360]   burden of providing materially for the family, namely the husband, not the
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.280]   father, not the wife.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.480]   Of course, everybody in the clan, the extended family, all the more so in an
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.160]   agrarian culture, everybody's pitching in to make life work, especially in the
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.280]   agrarian society, but there is a unique responsibility falling to the new
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.040]   husband.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.200]   Number three, there is a new structure of responsibility for who bears the
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   primary burden of protecting the new family.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   Of course, the whole clan is important in providing protection, but there's a new
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   special burden that falls not to the father any longer, that is the father of
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.360]   the groom, but falls to the husband in seeing to it that his wife and children
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.080]   are protected and safe.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.800]   And number four, there's a new structure of responsibility for who bears the
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.880]   primary burden of providing leadership in this new unit of marriage.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.400]   And hence Paul calls the husband the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.480]   church, which has profound implications for how each of them relates to the
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.360]   generation that has just gone before, which used to embody so much authority.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:00.040]   Those four new structures of allegiance and responsibility necessarily lead to a
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   kind of leaving mother and father, leaving old structures of allegiance, old
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.920]   structures of provision, old structures of protection, old structures of
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.400]   leadership. At least that much is built into the very nature of what the New
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Testament describes as marriage.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:33.240]   Now, what's not mandated with any explicitness or specificity is how much
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:42.760]   geography or distance, like 10 feet or 10 miles, must exist between this new unit of
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.240]   social life called marriage on the one hand and mother and father on the other
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.920]   hand. I would guess this is very different from culture to culture, depending on how
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   clans and villages and cities and vocations are conceived in those cultures.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.440]   So I think the principle would go something like this across all cultures.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:13.640]   We may adapt to present cultural norms to the degree that they don't undermine the
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.960]   new structures of responsibility in marriage.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.560]   And whenever there is a compromising or undermining of those new structures, we
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.160]   should be moving towards some cultural alteration in our living situation.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.160]   So that's the best I can do without too much specificity.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   But let me close with one last thought.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.640]   When Paul is thinking about taking care of widows in 1 Timothy 5, 8, he says, if
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.840]   anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for the members of his
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.080]   household, he's denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   He's thinking about mom or grandmama, and her husband has died and she has no
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.120]   resources.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.040]   So I don't think that leaving mother and father in the forming of a new family
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:15.560]   should mean a loss of care or a loss of thankfulness or a loss of respect, but
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.040]   that whatever distance happens, there should be some sense of ongoing
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.800]   responsibility that aging parents be taken care of.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.160]   Amen.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.720]   That's a good and helpful perspective.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.480]   And Ruby, thanks for the email question.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   And on a related note, we recently talked about caring for aging parents.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.040]   That was in episode number 1078 titled Retirement Homes and Caring for Aging
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.480]   Parents.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.080]   That was an episode we released back on August 9th.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.840]   You can find that episode in our archives at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.360]   And there you can search our past episodes, browse them all, and check out
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.200]   all the many questions we have addressed over the years.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   Well, the apostle John tells us that there is a sin that leads to death and
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   there's a sin that does not lead to death.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.000]   So what's the difference between the sin that leads to death and the sin that
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   doesn't?
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.160]   We'll look at 1 John 5, verses 16 to 17 on Monday.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.040]   Amen.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   Amen.
