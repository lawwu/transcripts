[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Last Sunday morning at around 1130 AM, an entire family entered heaven together.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   Jameson and Catherine Powell and their three small children were driving from Minneapolis
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.080]   to Colorado for final preparations as missionaries to Japan.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.320]   They planned to leave in October.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.040]   But in an interstate construction zone in western Nebraska, a semi-truck rear-ended
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.680]   the family vehicle.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.920]   Tragically, the entire family died at the scene, including Jameson and Catherine, both
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.320]   29, and their three young children, three-year-old Ezra, 23-month-old Violet, and two-month-old
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.600]   Calvin.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   The 53-year-old trucker was arrested and charged with five counts of felony motor vehicle homicide.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.760]   But today, the life and the faith and the obedience of Jameson and Catherine was celebrated
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.000]   at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.680]   John Piper was asked to deliver the pastoral prayer, and here's what he said.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.640]   Would you pray with me?
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:19.820]   O Lord, God of might and mercy and mystery.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:31.760]   You have driven the arrows of your quiver into the breast of your people, your beloved.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.820]   You have filled our throat with bitterness and gall.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:48.680]   You have made our teeth grind on gravel and laid us down with wounds in the ashes of dreams.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.780]   You have taken away our sleep and replaced our gladness with groaning.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:03.860]   You have covered us with shadows and the shadows of those we love, and we have reached out
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.340]   in vain to touch their bodies.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.740]   Happiness has fled through the window where the rain pours in.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:24.940]   Peace has put her hand on the latch, and endurance wavers at the threshold of our soul.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.260]   A voice is heard like Rachel's, lamentation and bitter weeping.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.780]   Where is the comfort for her children because they are no more?
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.280]   You have spared us, us, who have lived out the fullness of our days through no merit
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.380]   of our own, who would happily have finished our course and taken their place, but you
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:09.740]   have not spared even the children or the valiant young lovers, your most loyal servants.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.020]   O Lord, our eyes are on you.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.400]   We do not look to another for hope, to you alone, to you we cry.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.140]   Remember our affliction, remember the bitter wormwood and the gall.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.020]   You have not made us drink this cup in vain.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.480]   Peace we call to mind, and therefore we have hope.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.980]   Your steadfast love, O Lord, never ceases.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.460]   Your mercies never come to an end.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.140]   They are new every morning.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.580]   Great is your faithfulness.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.580]   You alone, O Lord, are our portion, and therefore we will hope in you.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.300]   You are good to those who wait for you, to the soul who seeks you.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.540]   You are good today, and you were good last Sunday.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.140]   So we are waiting.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.240]   We are looking for the salvation of the Lord.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.500]   We are not running from the yoke of this dark providence or throwing off the burden of your
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.540]   good sovereignty.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:45.780]   We are waiting and looking for the yoke to be made easy and the burden light.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.580]   You do not hide yourself forever.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.980]   Though you cause grief, you will have compassion according to the abundance of your steadfast
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:08.100]   love, for you do not afflict from your heart or grieve the children of men.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.620]   We know your heart, O God, for there is nothing in the world more bright, more blazing, more
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:26.260]   terrible, more beautiful, more bloody, more hopeful than the revelation of your heart
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.660]   in the death and triumph of your Son, Jesus.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.940]   Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.780]   Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted, but he was pierced for our
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.180]   transgressions, he was wounded for our iniquities.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.300]   Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.340]   For we, like sheep, have gone astray, we've turned every one to his own way, and the Lord
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.820]   has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:14.980]   This is the great and glorious rock where we stand or lie, prostrate, and on which we
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.140]   give thanks for the lives of Jameson and Catherine and Ezra and Violet and Calvin, who did not
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.380]   count their lives to be more valuable than obedience.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:36.260]   We praise you that they did not snatch a few vain years of life on this earth in exchange
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:45.580]   for allegiance to their King, but set their faces like flint toward Japan in finishing
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.980]   their course in the ministry they had received from the Lord Jesus.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:58.940]   And we praise you they did finish it, like your Apostle Paul, who wrote from Rome, "I
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:08.620]   have finished my course," though he never got to Spain.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.900]   We stand on this mighty rock of Christ and his shed blood for our sins and the sins of
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:23.260]   the Powell's family, and on this victorious triumph over death, and standing on this rock
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:33.740]   we pray for these parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, who sit with pieces of thread in their hands
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:40.180]   from a fabric of life woven from the womb and then consumed.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:51.260]   Father, we ask that you would sustain in their hearts, as we have already seen, an unshakable
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.780]   confidence that the countless hours of investment in Jameson and Catherine and the children
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.900]   were not in vain.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.740]   Because your promise in 1 Corinthians 15, 58, that their labors were not in vain, is
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:18.820]   built on a mighty "therefore," and on the mighty, glorious, greatest foundation of the
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.980]   best chapter in the Bible about the resurrection of Jesus and his people from the dead.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:35.220]   And we pray for these brothers and sisters, the brothers and sisters of Jameson and Catherine,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:44.180]   that in spite of the sudden and horrific severing of priceless sibling ties, they will feel
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:54.780]   the unbreakable bond that binds them through the brotherhood of Jesus, who said, "Who are
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.500]   my brothers and sisters?
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.740]   Here are my brothers and sisters.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.500]   Never does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:18.180]   Lord, cause this family to know and feel this circle is not broken.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:24.380]   And I pray for the cousins, these children, oh God.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:30.100]   Make the risen, living, reigning Jesus real to them.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:38.500]   And as they taste what we could wish no child would ever have to taste, grant them to know
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:48.060]   and feel that the arms of Jesus are strong and that in his arms all are well.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:57.300]   For he did not promise, "I will be with you to the end of your life," but to the end of
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.380]   the age in death and life.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:13.180]   And Father, I pray for the young people in this room and around the world who remain,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:20.340]   that they would find the love of their lives, their Catherine, their Jameson, and embrace
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:29.540]   together the second proposal that Jameson made to his beloved, to lead the family in
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:36.420]   obedience whether it is life or death or discomfort or disappointment, to take up our cross just
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.580]   as he did to suffer and die.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:52.460]   Lord, in the name of Jesus and by the blood of these five, I ask, raise up, raise up a
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:02.420]   legion of replacements for the global glory of his imperial majesty, Jesus Christ.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:09.380]   Forbid that any of your children when they hear this news would waste their lives on
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.140]   trifles.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:22.260]   And again, Lord, we pray for Tony Wheatley, whose head is covered with shame, whose hands
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.540]   are stained with blood.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:33.780]   And we stand in awe that the heart of this family is not a vengeful heart.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:41.860]   And we pray that Mr. Wheatley will find the one and only remedy for shame and guilt, Jesus.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:52.580]   And we ask that in time, through Christ, he would make his way to heaven and know the
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:12:00.460]   indescribable miracle of reconciliation with those already there.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:07.380]   And finally, we pray for Japan, that the great idols of gold and silver and material success
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:16.940]   would fall before the blood of this family, that these five, even these three little ones
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.780]   who have now grown to the fullness of their glory and the perfection of beauty, not through
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:29.220]   the trials of three score and ten, but in the twinkling of an eye, that these all, these
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:40.020]   five might be found among the champions of the victory of the gospel in Japan.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:47.580]   In the name of Jesus and his great mercy and for his glory, we pray.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   Amen.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:56.120]   That was John Piper's funeral prayer today at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.860]   at the funeral of Jameson and Catherine Powles and their three young children, Ezra, Violet,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.860]   and Calvin, all laid to rest today.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.420]   Please keep their families and extended families and their many friends in your prayers today.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   Amen.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.420]   Amen.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.420]   Amen.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.420]   Amen.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.420]   Amen.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.420]   Amen.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.420]   [Join the crew]
