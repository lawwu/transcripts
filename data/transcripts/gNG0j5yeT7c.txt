[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.480]   - Last month, a 22-year-old entrepreneur
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.000]   named Emil Barr wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   with a provocative title,
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.880]   "Work-Life Balance Will Keep You Mediocre."
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.240]   In it, Barr claims financial success
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.560]   requires sacrificing sleep, health,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.060]   and social connections in your 20s.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.520]   Now, this article annoyed a lot of people, including me,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.860]   but here's a key question that has stuck around.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.260]   Is it possible that Barr might be at least partly right?
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.800]   This is a debate worth having,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.740]   and it's exactly what we're gonna get into today.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.380]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is "Deep Questions."
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:56.960]   Today's episode, I want work-life balance.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.920]   Am I doomed with the mediocrity?
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.740]   All right, so we should start with the actual op-ed itself.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.700]   I'm gonna bring this up here on the screen,
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.580]   if you could do that, Jesse,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.320]   for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.680]   So as mentioned, the title of this article is
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580]   "Work-Life Balance Will Keep You Mediocre."
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.120]   The subhead was "For Financial Freedom by Age 30: Optimize Ruthlessly During Your Peak Physical and Cognitive Years."
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.760]   This came out online on August 18th.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.200]   This came out in print the next day on August 19th.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.740]   What I want to do here is just read you a few quotes from the article that should give you an idea of what exactly the author is arguing.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.680]   So I want to start where the author sort of introduces himself a little bit more.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.680]   He says,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.520]   "I'm 22, and I've built two companies that together are valued at more than $20 million."
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.360]   Jumping down here.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.420]   "When people ask how I did it, the answer isn't what they expect or want to hear.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.560]   I eliminated work-life balance entirely and just worked.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.980]   When you front load success early, you buy the luxury of choice for the rest of your life."
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.580]   Well, that's sort of like his big claim.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.480]   Let's get some more details from the article.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.740]   Here's a quote from a couple paragraphs later.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.040]   "During my first year working on Step Up Social, I averaged three and a half hours of sleep a night
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.180]   and had about 12 and a half hours every day to focus on business.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.880]   The physical and mental toll was brutal.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.720]   I gained 80 pounds, lived on Red Bull, and struggled with anxiety.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   But this level of intensity was the only way to build a multi-million dollar company."
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.060]   Heady words from Mr. Barr.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.500]   I have a couple other quotes I want to read here.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.300]   Here's another one.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   "I steer clear of courses that banned laptops in the classroom because I couldn't be offline
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.940]   for three or more hours a day when my team and clients needed me.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.820]   Plus, it is at $19.99 and that kind of thinking won't get us anywhere."
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.260]   Another piece of advice he has, "Every commitment had to justify its place on my calendar.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.660]   With social events, casual hangouts, and even family gatherings weighed against business priorities,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.660]   I constantly felt guilty about missing important moments with loved ones.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.100]   But ironically, the relationships that mattered most grew stronger because the time I did spend with them was deeply intentional."
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.300]   That's good to hear. I appreciate that.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.100]   He also says, "The path I chose was painful.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.740]   There's no sugarcoating the mental health struggles, the physical deterioration, or the social isolation that came with this intensity.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:50.380]   But in a winner-take-all economy, extreme efficiency during your peak physical and mental years becomes a baseline for building wealth that lasts a lifetime."
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.420]   All right. Well, there we go. There's some strong statements from a precocious young man.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.620]   I want to play a little audio here of the Emil Barr himself.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.460]   This is him appearing on Fox & Friends in the aftermath of this op-ed, sort of explaining why he wrote it and his inspiration.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.500]   So let's play that clip there for a second there, Jesse.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.860]   Tell me how you did it.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.740]   Yeah. Well, it was a lot of sacrifice, and it wasn't easy, and that's not necessarily something everyone wants to hear.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.100]   But the truth is, to have extraordinary achievements, I think you have to make extraordinary sacrifices.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.900]   All right. So what was your motivation behind this?
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:35.220]   I saw folks like Elon, you know, that slept on factory floors to build Tesla, and, like, people like Kobe Bryant, you know, that trained at 4 a.m. even on the off-season.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.020]   Yeah. And so I made those same decisions to grow my business.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.260]   Elon and Kobe. This is very Gen -- this is very Gen-C, Jesse.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260]   As you can imagine, this op-ed generated a lot of reaction.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.300]   The Wall Street Journal article itself has over 2,000 comments just on the article itself.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.020]   Lots of follow-up media, lots of follow-up articles, lots of discussion on social media, on Reddit, and other types of places where people discuss these things.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.500]   As mentioned, Barr went on Fox Business, and then that earned him a call-up to Fox & Friends on the main Fox channel.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.540]   Much of the feedback that he generated, probably not surprisingly, given what I've read you so far, was negative.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.540]   So here's a comment from the original article I want to read here that caught my attention.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.580]   I checked the publication date twice, just to be sure this wasn't an old April Fool's Day prank.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.340]   The authoritative tone of the 22-year-old author is comical.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.580]   Does anyone over the age of 30 actually endorse a front-loading lifestyle?
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.580]   And did he really use the word "mediocre" to describe a person who earns an average wage?
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.940]   I can't help but suspect Andrew Tate peer-reviewed this op-ed.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.620]   Here's another reaction.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.740]   This one came from Reddit.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.620]   "My dad was always away at the office, and I really only have a few memories of him.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.540]   He caught a sudden illness and died in his early 40s when I was a teenager.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.420]   I'll be mediocre and take my kids camping instead.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.940]   Cheers, Emil."
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.460]   And finally, here's a letter to the editor from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.300]   "Mr. Barr's story is no national model.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.620]   It rests on the peculiar economics of infinitely scalable digital platforms.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.780]   Does he really believe the country would be richer if more young Americans spent their
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.580]   peak years optimizing algorithms on Chinese social media platforms rather than studying,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.540]   soldiering, or otherwise fulfilling their civic duty?"
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.700]   So people weren't that happy.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.660]   I definitely got this a lot, Jesse, in my personal inbox.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.340]   It came over my various text threads.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.020]   This came in some, I guess, right, in our official emails as well.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.140]   Yeah, we definitely got some emails about it.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.300]   Yeah, this definitely generated some debate.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.780]   You probably had a similar reaction to me, a little bit of Gen Z reaction there, right?
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.620]   A little knee-jerk, like, uh-oh, 22-year-olds telling me what to do.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.220]   What do his businesses do?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.820]   You know, I looked into that.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.060]   It's a little bit tricky, which I think is always the point with sort of dorm room bro businesses.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.700]   It's always a little tricky to pick apart what they're actually doing.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.260]   So he started a company, as best I can tell, that was called Step Up Social, which
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.620]   did exactly what you would expect a 20-year-old's business to do.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.020]   It helped TikTok influencers, you know, have more successful channels and connect to brands that want
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.140]   to have sponsorships on their TikTok channel, so sort of like peak Gen Z.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.820]   And then he, it was acquired or he rebranded it or it merged with another company.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.220]   There's, you know, our researcher, newsletter director, Nate, found some LinkedIn post somewhere
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.940]   where the guy talked about how his deal to merge this with another network involved,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.500]   instead of money, them buying him a Porsche or something.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.220]   So I don't know.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.180]   Then he started this other company called Flagship Education.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:49.900]   Flashpass Education, not to be mistaken for the thing you buy at Universal Studios to get ahead
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.460]   of the lines.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.140]   It's kind of, I can't quite figure out what's going on with this thing.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.500]   In theory, it's like a flashcard program you can use to get digitally certified.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.420]   So do like kind of online courses on topics to give you a certification that can help you get jobs.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.740]   But I know he won a business plan contest, student business plan contest,
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.940]   and got a grant from the state of Ohio to work on this.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.780]   There's no actual products available on the website, just links that say book a demo.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.380]   It has testimonials.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.780]   But unless every user so far, a flash pass is also a model, they're clearly stock photography.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.700]   I mean, it's like beautifully lit and posed, you know, with their backpack on the campus.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.860]   It looks like a community college brochure.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.060]   So I don't know what's going on.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:39.820]   Look, these are, I'm sure they're, you can at that age sort of trade your youth and energy
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.020]   for essentially like weight.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.620]   Like you can kind of hustle and like, I'm going to get brands interested.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.620]   And hey, I'm going to match you up with this TikTok person.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.740]   And will you pay for them?
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.620]   And I'll take a cut.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.060]   And so I don't quite know what's going on.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.420]   It's not, not to knock a meal bar, but it's not Bill Gates leaving Harvard for Microsoft.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.140]   Where it was, you know, here's our clear IP on which you can build a scalable business model
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.060]   that I'm going to take on investment right away to scale.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.300]   This is not Mark Zuckerberg leaving Harvard after he already had venture commitments, right?
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:15.580]   This is not the, the Sergei and Larry at Stanford saying, we've developed, you know,
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   this, this page rank algorithm that is revolutionary for web search.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.700]   And we have funding from Sequoia.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.300]   We're going to, we're going to start Google, right?
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.460]   Like this is, it's not that it's sort of the types of businesses.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.580]   And I've had these businesses myself when I was young that 20 year olds start as best I can tell.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.220]   All right.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.340]   So there we go.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.220]   We got this guy.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.020]   He wrote this op-ed.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.660]   People are upset.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.660]   It did.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.020]   However, you know, as, as I, I hinted at earlier, it kind of stuck with me,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.300]   right?
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.900]   Because I wanted to be careful.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.220]   It's easy to be upset about the fact this kid is young.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.740]   It's easy to be upset about the fact that these are like dorm room businesses.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.860]   And no one really knows what they are.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.100]   And it's not, I invented a new web search.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.660]   Right.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.460]   So it's easy to be kind of dismissive, but not everyone thinks that the,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.220]   the basic points that the bar is making here is wrong.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.180]   Just last week, Palantir CEO, Alex Karp said something similar.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.220]   I'm reading a quote here.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.060]   I've never met someone really successful who had a great social life at 20.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.340]   Susie Welch is a well-known professor at the NYU Stern School of Business,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.700]   wrote into the Wall Street Journal in response to this op-ed.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   And she said, don't get me wrong.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.620]   I don't consider Mr. Barr a boy genius.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.540]   He says dumb things, dot, dot, dot.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.740]   But I do give him points for saying something that I only mutter to my MBA students
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.300]   while also asking forgiveness for being an oldster.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.140]   You can't well-being yourself to wealth.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.460]   There are not, there are going to be seasons of misery, which could last years.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.540]   That might not be fair, but it's how life tends to go.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:59.180]   So there's something in this 22 year old's op-ed that I don't think we can just dismiss out of hand.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:05.260]   And in particular, there's one quote I want to pull out, which to me is the most interesting,
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.460]   intriguing and impactful quote of this entire op-ed.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.500]   And this is where Barr says the following, "I'm not suggesting that everyone eliminate
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.780]   work-life balance, but rather arguing that for ambitious young people who want to build wealth,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.660]   traditional balance is a trap that will keep you comfortably mediocre."
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.500]   That is really the core of his argument.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.940]   Not whether or not he's really a good entrepreneur, not whether or not his claim at the end of the
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.020]   article that he's going to be a billionaire by 30 and solve climate change is cringeworthy or not,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:41.820]   but this idea, work-life balance is a path to mediocrity.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.940]   That idea is sort of sticky and uncomfortable.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.580]   It sort of sticks with us a little bit.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.540]   Like, is that true?
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.820]   A lot of us who do think about more than just work,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.460]   often in our quiet moments, maybe wonder about this.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.740]   So I want to take a closer look at this claim because I think it really matters.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   And I think it needs a more systematic investigation than what we're getting with
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.700]   just this sort of back and forth conversation online.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.500]   So let's do that.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.740]   Now, I want to start by saying, "What do we mean by mediocre?"
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.260]   Work-life balance will make you mediocre.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.700]   What do we mean by mediocre?
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.820]   I think the right way to actually answer this question is we have to flip it around
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   and we have to say, "What does it mean to you to not be mediocre?"
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.300]   And of course, that's a clunky way of saying,
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   "What does it mean to you to be successful in your professional life?"
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.980]   We have to answer that more refined question, right?
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.180]   So here's our more refined question.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.580]   "How does work-life balance impact your attempts to be successful in your professional life?"
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.220]   I think that's the better way to actually get at what's going on here.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.780]   But when we say it that way, right away, we see a problem.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.100]   What do you mean by successful?
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.900]   There's a lot of different definitions that people have for not being mediocre,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.460]   what it means to have a successful working life.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.460]   And the answer to this question of does work-life balance get in the way depends on what definition
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.020]   of successful that we're actually using.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.780]   So I want to get really systematic here.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.700]   In response to popular demand, I haven't done this in a while, Jesse, but people,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.940]   especially I would say fine art lovers among our audience,
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:17.580]   art critics, people who really enjoy seeing really good draftsmanship have said,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.260]   "Why haven't you done your tablet recently?"
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.060]   So I'm doing it, I'm bringing for those who are watching instead of listening, and you know,
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.660]   you're welcome, I'm going to build a chart here because we are going to get way more systematic
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.860]   than the meal bar did.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.340]   So for those who are listening, I have two columns on this chart.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.380]   On the left, it says success model, and on the right, it says requirements.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.540]   So what I want to do here is go through the different common models that people have for
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.180]   what it means for their work-life not to be mediocre.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.580]   And for each of those, I want to answer the question, what sacrifices are required?
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.980]   In other words, like what is the way to succeed with this model?
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.820]   So we can see, do some of these require that we sacrifice work-life balance and others don't?
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.180]   Do they all, do none of them?
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.860]   Let's get more systematic here.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.340]   All right, so I want to start by giving Barr his due.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:12.220]   And what I mean by that is there are certainly some particular definitions of success where what he's
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.260]   saying actually does in some sense hold.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.700]   All right, I'm going to put two in particular.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:24.060]   So the first thing I'm going to write here is startup exit.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.860]   Now, I'm not typing, Jesse.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.900]   That's just my great handwriting.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.340]   I like it when you draw.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.620]   Jesse thinks it's calligraphy, but it's just my natural great handwriting.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.340]   Startup exit.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.060]   What do I mean by that?
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.780]   Okay, this is a very common idea that some people have for what it means to be successful in their
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.420]   career.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.140]   And that's like the notion of I have a startup, probably a technology startup that has an exit
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.260]   that makes me a lot of money.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.220]   I think this is what Barr has in mind when he's thinking about mediocrity and success is he's
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.220]   thinking what I want to do is have a startup that eventually is sell or acquired.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.180]   And I make a lot of money tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:05.020]   So what is required for this model of success to have a successful startup exit?
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.300]   Well, if you're in a venture-backed startup going for this, the investors are probably going to demand
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.860]   that you grind.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.660]   So I'm going to write that down here on what's required.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.900]   I'm going to write the word grind.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.420]   Whether or not you need it, this is what is expected in this particular field.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.380]   So if your model of success is I sell a company for a lot of money, a startup, a venture-backed company,
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.660]   you probably will have to grind.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.660]   Not as hard probably as Barr was talking about.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.940]   We'd have a lot more heart attacks.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.100]   But they do expect you're answering emails.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.300]   You're having meetings.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.260]   You're staying there late.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.620]   You're working weekends.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.060]   Partially, it's performative and partially because when you're in a tech startup,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.460]   it's a small number of people doing a lot of things.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.660]   You haven't had time to hire yet.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.500]   And the only way to juggle everything is to sort of inefficiently try to touch on them all.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.180]   So in that world, Barr is sort of right.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.700]   All right, here is another world in which I think Barr is sort of right.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.940]   I'm going to call this elite wage labor.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:08.940]   All right, so these are jobs where there is a clear deal offered, no obfuscation.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.820]   Here's the clear deal.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:15.980]   If you have an elite education and you did really well in your elite education, you're a top 20 school,
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.660]   what we're going to offer you is in exchange for you giving us a large number of hours,
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.780]   so somewhere between 60 to 80 hours a week, in exchange for you giving us a large number of hours,
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.020]   we will pay you a very high salary for those hours.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:35.100]   So there are certain professions that offer this deal to the small segment of the population that
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.460]   happens to have elite college education.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.060]   So this would be working for a big law firm.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.620]   This would be working for a big consulting firm.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.860]   This would be working for a big finance firm.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.860]   That's just the deal they offer, your hours for money.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.620]   Now, the reason why they are demanding that many hours is that typically you're actually
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.140]   being billed for those hours.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.700]   So the more hours you work, the more money they can make.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.140]   And so our agreement will be if we've gone through all the trouble of hiring this Harvard kid,
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.100]   is to say work 80 hours a week so we can get as much money as possible out of you.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.500]   Finance is a little bit more complicated, but it's sort of just more the culture there.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.460]   So if you're in one of those, if that's your model of success,
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.020]   we're still in a meal bar territory.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.140]   What's required, you're going to have to grind a lot of hours.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.660]   That's just the way those industries work.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.900]   But here's the thing.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.260]   This is a very narrow band of economic activity.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:31.500]   It's a very narrow band of economic activity that is open to only a very small group of people.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.060]   To really have access to like Silicon Valley funding, especially if you're young, that is hard.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.100]   You basically have to come out of a top technical program like MIT Computer Science and got into an
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.580]   incubator program before they'll even listen to you.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.580]   If you want to be in one of these elite wage labor jobs, you got to be coming out of an IV or another
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.940]   top 20 type elite school.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.340]   And even then only the best students who go through all the right work to do the interviewing right are
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.220]   going to get those positions.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.940]   So it's a very small amount of people to which these particular jobs are actually open.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:05.340]   Interestingly, even though Emil Barr I think is probably basing his approach on the startup exit
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.020]   success model, even he doesn't even have access to that world.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.540]   You know, he is not running a venture-backed startup in the way that this model demands.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.580]   These are, he's doing, these are more sort of, they're not solopreneur companies,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.020]   but they're sort of like dorm room businesses.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.620]   Like I'm trying to mix and match sponsors to TikTok influencers.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:30.220]   That's different than I've taken on, you know, 5 million in series A from Sequoia because we're
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.300]   going to build out the server farm for our search algorithm.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.260]   So he's sort of mimicking what is required of the sort of Elon Musk venture-backed tech
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.100]   company world, even though he's not himself actually has access to that world.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.700]   Similarly, the elite wage labor world, it's pretty narrow.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   If you are in one of those worlds, you do need to grind.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.780]   But I think those are very narrow worlds.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.660]   And so we cannot generalize from those that in general, work-life balance will make you mediocre.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.180]   In these industries, it's not even that work-life flight, work-life balance will make you mediocre.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.220]   You're just not allowed to have it.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   It's just the, it's just the agreement of the industries.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   This is how many hours you have to work.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.060]   It's just, that's just what it is.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.900]   Okay.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.180]   But there are other definitions I think are far more common that people have in mind when they think about
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.420]   what does it mean to not be mediocre in their job?
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:20.620]   And here, the answer of what's required to succeed starts to become more interesting.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.580]   So let's put down another common one here.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:30.220]   I'm going to call this impact and respect.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.700]   So for a lot of people, when they think about successful career and avoiding mediocrity, it is,
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.740]   I am doing something that is high impact.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.460]   It matters.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.340]   And/or I'm highly respected for it.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.140]   This is very desirable to a lot of people.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.340]   And this is very much matches what a lot of people think about as success.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:54.940]   So you're a respected artist or writer, you know, academic or athlete or musician or filmmaker.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.580]   Sometimes as you're having a really big impact on the world, your books really make a difference.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.420]   Sometimes it's just the respect.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.940]   You're like Jiro and Jiro Dreams of Sushi, where you have this, you know, four-star Michelin sushi
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.020]   restaurant in the subway in Tokyo.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.340]   And only a few hundred people have been there that year, but everyone in the industry knows you're just
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.140]   the best in the world at making sushi and there's like a real meaning that comes out of that.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.540]   This is a very common notion of what it means to be successful.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.820]   So what matters here?
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.900]   Is it grinding?
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.020]   Well, no, I happen to know a lot about this because it's one of the models of success that
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.020]   I have been writing about for my entire career.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.500]   It's a model of success I really care about.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.420]   And what I've written about in multiple books and many articles, including some that date all
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.740]   the way back to when I was in my twenties, I found these Jesses.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.500]   So I sort of have a counterpoint to what email bear was saying.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:52.220]   What matters here is relentlessly working on the things that make you better, not on what you want
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.820]   to do, not on busyness, but on the activities that make you better at your craft, sticking
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.060]   to those activities day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.500]   You want to be a respected sushi chef day after day after day.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   You're pushing your ability.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.980]   You're learning more.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.180]   You're pushing your ability at sushi.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.140]   You want to be a writer.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.740]   You write, write, write.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.860]   I started writing professionally when I was 20 years old.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.140]   I never stopped writing.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.900]   When I finish a book, it's another book.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.100]   When I finish that, it's another book.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.260]   Like I am always working on books.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.820]   I'm always trying to make myself better.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.860]   That is what's required.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.060]   It's hard work.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.980]   But here's what it's not.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.380]   Hard to do work.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.820]   Because when you're trying to improve yourself, it requires focus and deliberate practice, etc.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.460]   You can only do that so many hours in a day, and then that's it.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.100]   He talks about Kobe Bryant.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.180]   Yeah, Kobe Bryant would wake up early to practice, right?
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.100]   But there's only so much that Kobe Bryant could practice in a day before I had to worry about injury.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.980]   You talk to any sort of professional athlete, they're like, no, no, it's not a game of who can
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.820]   practice the more total hours, injury.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   Rest and recovery is important.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.860]   What matters is you're doing the exact right type of training relentlessly.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.660]   Off season, what's the exact right thing to be doing in the off season?
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.660]   In the season, what's the right thing to do in the season?
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.260]   What's the exact amount of rest to get?
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.860]   It's relentless and it's hard, but it doesn't require sleeping three hours.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.100]   It doesn't require, I don't see my family.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.100]   Because there's only so much of this hard work you can do in any given day.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.500]   I relentlessly work on my writing.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.260]   I've been doing this since I was 20 years old.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.300]   I rarely work past 5:30.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.380]   I don't grind.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.340]   I don't stay up late.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.580]   I want to spend time with my family and my friends and my communities and my other types
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.060]   of interests.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.100]   I want to put in a minimum of 40 to 50 hours a week working on Halloween display decorations.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.060]   I think Jesse has seen what I have laid out in the other office right now.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.940]   We'll get into that later.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.540]   I care about hard work, but not hard to do work.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.380]   So that's what matters if we're going to talk about being high impact or high respected.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.660]   It's the long game.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.940]   So I'm going to say relentless depth.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:58.780]   Returning to the things that matter every day, relentlessly, ignoring the distractions
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.220]   that want to take you away from that.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.780]   Doesn't make any one day particularly hard, but you have to have the hard work of sticking with that.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.620]   So that is a different model than what Emil Barr is talking about.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:08.940]   All right.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.140]   There's other definitions though.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.580]   What about remarkability?
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.060]   What I mean about this is there's a lot of people, when you say, "What is your definition
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.540]   of like a non-mediocre professional life?"
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.900]   They say, "I want it to be remarkable."
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.180]   In the literal sense, remarkable that other people remark about my life and what I do.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:29.900]   Like that's really cool.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.940]   Or that's really interesting.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.940]   Or, "Hey, did you know what this guy does?
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.500]   Let me introduce you to him at the party or her at the party."
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.140]   A lot of people, that's the definition of not being mediocre.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:47.180]   So maybe you live in a really exotic place or have a really exotic job or you have a really exotically
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.020]   sort of autonomous life.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.100]   There's certain people like this I've written about before.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.260]   Maybe you're like Laird Hamilton, living on the North Shore of Maui, waiting for the big waves to
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.860]   come, just sort of sitting around like exercising and bored until the waves come.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.780]   And then you go off in your jet skis and do this sort of amazing feats of physical things.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.300]   Or maybe you're like Paul Jarvis, who I've written about in Slow Productivity.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.220]   We talk about it on the podcast all the time, who sort of moved from his busy web development
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.700]   life in Vancouver to Vancouver Island, to a small house in the woods near a surf break on Tolfino.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:24.380]   Cut back his hours, raised his rates, made his life much cheaper, right?
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.900]   They reduced their expenses.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.740]   As he says, there's not much to spend money on there.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.260]   It's kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.940]   And they surf and have this small town and have a green house and keep chickens or whatever.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.980]   It's a remarkable life.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.780]   It's really interesting and different than what his peers were doing.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.580]   It might be like the Thameses, right?
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.940]   Up in, up there in Vermont, otherwise known online as the Frugal Woods.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.740]   I talked about them.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.620]   I interviewed Liz in my book, Digital Minimalism, where they were very frugal.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.700]   They saved a lot of money.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.660]   They were living right outside Boston and Cambridge, Central Square.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.660]   And they were very frugal and saving money.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.860]   And they bought a property up in Vermont.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.020]   They moved up there, allowed her to stop working.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.020]   He kept working, but in a remote capacity.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.340]   They rented out their house in Boston, which more or less covered the small mortgage they
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.260]   had on the house up in Vermont.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.660]   More recently, he was able to stop working.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.620]   They have this life on this 55 acres where they do maple syruping and they have apple orchards
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.900]   and trails and all this sort of outdoor quiet living with their kids in this local community.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.300]   That's an example of a remarkable life.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.180]   You remark on it.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.100]   Oh, I got to introduce you to these people.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.460]   They're doing something interesting.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.180]   All right.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.860]   If that's your definition of not being mediocre, how do you get there?
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.700]   Well, it's not about eschewing work-life balance.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.020]   It tends to be much more about build career capital, have the courage to leverage it.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.380]   What I mean about that is you get good at something that has a sort of lasting,
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.420]   sustainable value to the market that can get you sort of a lasting, sustainable source of like
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.620]   income and stability.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.220]   And then you have the courage to say, I'm going to build a really interesting life around that.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:10.300]   The Frugal Woods, Nate was a computer programmer basically for nonprofits.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.380]   And they sort of worked out like, this is a very useful skill.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.220]   We can't run our organization without you.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.100]   And he said, great.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.020]   I don't want to try to maximize salary with you anymore.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.180]   I want to be able to work remotely and on my own terms.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.300]   And then we'll then have the courage to build this whole life
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.100]   up in the woods of Vermont around that career capital.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.380]   Laird Hamilton had the capital of, I surf these crazy waves and I can get just
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.580]   enough sponsorship money out of being shown in those surfing magazines,
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.220]   surfing these waves to sort of make ends meet and I can keep doing this.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.620]   Paul Jarvis got really good at web development.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.860]   And he said, okay, instead of growing a big company, because there's all this demand now for me,
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.820]   I'll just raise my rates and work less hours.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.860]   So I will use this skill as the engine to move to Vancouver Island and live by the surf break in
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.140]   Tolfino and have a greenhouse.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.420]   So it's career capital and courage is what matters here.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.380]   So we'll put down career capital.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:12.060]   So not only is the answer not just grind, the answers differ depending on what your model is.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.620]   So we're being more systematic about this because, you know, that's the way I like to do it.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.300]   The final model of what people have in mind is what most people, just the average person has in mind.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.580]   If you say, what do you, what do you think about like having a successful career?
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:33.020]   Really what they envision is some variation of what we can call the post-war American dream.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.740]   I don't have family.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.700]   I live in a neighborhood.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.060]   I like nice house.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.580]   I'm not worried about money.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.940]   Like we're financially stable.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.700]   I'm not stressed out about money.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.180]   We go on two interesting vacations a year.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.940]   We're close knit communities that we're a part of.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.300]   We have good friends and hobbies.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.140]   I have spent a lot of time in my kid's life, picket fence, et cetera.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.460]   Starting in the sixties, we began to sort of get bored with this and say it was bougie.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.340]   And this is not that interesting, but talk to a GI in 1945.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.860]   They would have been like, this is like the best possible life you could offer.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.660]   Are you kidding me?
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.780]   I'm not stressed about money.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.700]   I'm not stressed about my, my, my, uh, town being bombed out by, you know, a world war.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.380]   I have my own yard.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.500]   I have a car.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.620]   Like my friends are here.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.900]   We can walk to the, whatever.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.940]   I have a stable job.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.860]   That's interesting, but not too demanding.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.060]   That is for a lot of people.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.140]   That's not mediocre to have something like that is the dream.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.060]   I'm not, I, I, I have a family.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.900]   I love to spend time with, and I'm not stressed about money.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.860]   And my job is interesting.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.220]   And you know, I don't know.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.100]   I'm in the bowling league.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.220]   That's what a lot of people are thinking about.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.140]   So how do you do that?
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.460]   You get capable.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.380]   It's a, it's a term I'm playing with in my new book on the deep life that I'm writing
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.940]   right now is the power, the overlook power of capability.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.740]   What does it mean to be capable in the professional setting?
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.740]   I'm reliable.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.940]   I do the thing I say I'm going to do.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.060]   If I say I'm going to do this, I do it.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.300]   I do it.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.540]   When I say I'm going to do it, I do it at a high level of quality.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.500]   I've got my act together.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.140]   You can trust me.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.060]   I'm capable, right?
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.500]   I've got my arms on what's going on.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.780]   I don't take on too much work.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.860]   I choose to write projects that matter and I get them done.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.420]   And I'm professional and I'm nice and people like me.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.260]   We overlook how valuable capability is, but if you are capable, almost any profession,
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.460]   almost any job you have, what are the managers going to worry about?
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.340]   Losing you.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.540]   Oh, we have a capable person.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.420]   They get stuff done.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:17.820]   They're good.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.620]   They choose the right products.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.420]   They don't get overloaded.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.820]   They're nice.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.740]   They're a leader to the other people.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.700]   Capability gives you the post-war American dream.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.300]   It gives you that sort of stable job.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.220]   It's what allows you then also to be careful about your money and not to overspend and
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.860]   to stay in shape and to care about like, okay, I want to make sure that I do things with my kids.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.980]   This school's not working for me.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.540]   I'll make the change so that like things are okay.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.420]   We deal with you.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.020]   All of these things that are necessary for this, like, hey, we just sort of have
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.780]   a good rich life is built on a foundation of capability.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.500]   What Gen Z sometimes refers to sort of derogatorily as adulting.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.940]   I call it capability.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.380]   You build up those abilities.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.060]   This is boring stuff technically, right?
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.100]   It's time management systems.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.060]   It's productivity systems.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.100]   It's strategic plans.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.580]   It's having an explicit workload management system.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.300]   It's all the stuff I talk about in books like deep work and slow productivity, but it matters.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.500]   I don't know why I put a slash there.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.580]   Capability.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.260]   All right.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.740]   People who are listening, what you're missing is just cape, but cape a bit.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   I don't know what I'm writing here, Jesse.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.340]   Cape a bill.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.020]   You should hire me if you need like a fancy sign.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.220]   I'll just free hand it for you.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.540]   All right.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:26.860]   Boom.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.820]   There we go.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.620]   So here's what I mean about this.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:37.500]   Like, I don't want to get too much in the weeds here of exactly what these models are or exactly what
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.060]   is required.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.780]   But my point is you got to get more systematic here.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.220]   What do you mean by success?
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.060]   When you say you want to avoid mediocrity, what does that mean to you?
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.380]   And then you got to get specific what is really required to get there.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.380]   Sometimes it's like, be ready to grind.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.900]   If you're at a big tin law firm or you just got, you know, funding from Andreessen Horowitz.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.340]   Like we want our return on your weird web three idea.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.540]   But for most people in most models, this sort of like, I'm just going to stay up real late and
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.700]   burn it and be pretend like I'm in, you know, like the West Wing and have all these calls and
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.100]   emails and slack and I'm going to drink Red Bull all day.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.260]   Like, you know, that's not going to short term.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.300]   It doesn't, you know, whatever.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.260]   But that's not what it's going to matter in the long term for your definition of success.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.460]   So it does really matter.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.780]   So let's wrap this up.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.020]   Let me, let me read again that key quote from Barr's piece, the quote that sort of gave us some
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.580]   uneasiness.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.380]   I'm not suggesting that everyone eliminate work-life balance, but rather arguing that
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.100]   for ambitious young people who want to build wealth, traditional balance is a trap that will
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.780]   keep you comfortably mediocre.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.980]   All right.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.900]   So in the final accounting, was Barr right?
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:54.220]   I think in this case, Barr was asking the right question, but his answer was to narrow.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.380]   You need to get specific about what you mean by success, and then you need to learn specific
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.100]   strategies to reach that specific definition.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:06.060]   Barr's mistake was to think that all definitions of success require these performative 15 hour days
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.420]   and hustle, but they don't.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:14.700]   In fact, the definitions of success that do require that type of narrow hustle are very narrow,
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.020]   and they're open to only a very small number of people, and most people could care less about them.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.020]   Most definitions of success, by contrast, don't actually require wrecking your health
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.460]   or your social relations.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.180]   But here's the thing.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:31.180]   As we just saw, these other definitions of success aren't necessarily easy either.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.900]   They require hard work and focus work, just not all the hours of the day.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.660]   So why are we talking about this topic on this particular show, right?
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.180]   Well, look, in my roles as a computer scientist and a digital ethicist,
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:49.100]   I talk a lot about technology's impacts on our lives and how we should react to these changes.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.620]   And one of the most common vectors that new technologies use to colonize your life,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:33:01.580]   to keep you zonked out in video games or social media, to keep you doing mindless streaming or
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.700]   stewing in nihilism and outrage, is to take advantage of aimlessness.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.020]   When you're working actively towards a definition of the deep life,
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:16.300]   something that's compelling to you, suddenly TikTok and Call of Duty doesn't seem that attractive,
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.540]   and rage bait on YouTube starts to look childish.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.060]   But when you're instead drifting aimlessly through your life, especially when you're young,
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.780]   you become a target for these technologies.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:31.260]   If you don't get in the game, the tech companies will play your turn for you.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.980]   So my real fear about Emil Barr
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:39.020]   is not that he's going to trick a bunch of 22-year-olds into like giving up their sleep and
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.220]   working 100-hour work weeks, right? Most people see through that bravado.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:51.740]   My real fear instead is that people will look to Barr and be so turned off by the idea of work,
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.700]   oh, is this what it means to be successful in work, that they throw up their hands and give in the nihilism.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:03.740]   And then the technologies can creep in and ossify them in that position of aimlessness.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.940]   So you can go ahead and ignore Emil Barr, but we have to keep his underlying claim in mind,
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.740]   creating a deep life does require hard work, just not the simplistic performative type of hard work
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   that Barr talked about. So there we go. It may seem like a non-technology related issue, Jesse,
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.820]   but kind of is. It's like people like that make you anti-work. And when you're anti-work, you don't have
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:31.420]   focus. Well, you don't have focus. That's when, you know, TikTok kind of crawls in and is like,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.060]   hey, look at me. There's something interesting going on here. Also, Barr kind of looks like a 16-year-old
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:41.020]   Bond villain in some of the videos I found. So it doesn't help. There's a video where he had a
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.900]   mock turtleneck and a blazer and was holding a cat, like Blofeld from a Bond movie, but like,
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.820]   he looks like he's 16 years old. So I was like, that's not helping your cause. Not helping your cause.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.900]   So there we go. How do you go about playing with the word capability for the section in the book?
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:10.940]   So I'm working on this notion of a crash course in becoming a more capable human. So the idea is,
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.620]   you know, the book's about the deep life. How do you, how do you really create a brief life? We use
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.700]   lifestyle-centric planning. We talk a lot about that on the show, but a lot of people, I've discovered
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.900]   this on the show. A lot of people, when it comes time to do lifestyle-centric planning, to transform
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:28.060]   their life into something cool, to follow one of these like definitions of success, what they realize is,
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.380]   I don't even know how to get started. Like, I don't trust myself to even like do the basic work
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:41.260]   of transformation, or I'm in a place where I'm feeling so stuck, I can't even imagine what a more
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.500]   deeper life would even look like. And the issue there I've come to realize is just lack of basic
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.660]   capability. So to be capable means you kind of have your act together in the basic ways. You have some
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.900]   control over your time. You have some control over your mind. You have sort of a basic reserve of
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.580]   discipline. I can do a hard thing, even if it's optional, knowing that there's a longer-term goal,
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.420]   that this is going to give me. It's these type of basic level capability that allows you to have
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.460]   confidence. Oh, I can do stuff. Oh, lifestyle-centric planning? Let me give that a try.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:14.060]   That's the type of thing I could and maybe make progress on. And so I'm toying with a structure
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.780]   to the book where you learn all the ideas of the deep life. And then I have this four-month crash course,
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.060]   based loosely off of that really popular video of ours. Four months, two things per month, do these
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.300]   things. You'll come on the other side, recharge, and then you can get back to lifestyle-centric
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:33.660]   planning if you're struggling. So I'm just realizing these things kind of they all intertwine. It's
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.380]   all complicated. That's why I like simple op-eds. I can't complain though. I wrote op-eds in my 20s for
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:44.060]   major papers that also had like declarations about I've done this and this and this. And so I got to be
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.340]   careful about the pot calling the kettle black here a little bit. So there we go. All right. We got some
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.060]   good questions. Also, it's the first episode of a new month. So we have the books I read in August
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:01.180]   coming up. But first we have to get to what you all came here for, which was a word about our sponsors.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.900]   All right. So Jesse, I got to tell you about the newest thing I'm obsessed with. I'm going to hold
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:13.260]   it up here to the camera for those who are watching. See this right here? This is my Ridge wallet.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:21.340]   It's two slim pieces, I'll tap it here by the mic, of quality metal attached with strong elastic. My
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.460]   credit cards and my IDs are right in here. There's this little notch here so you push it so they can
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.580]   come out and you can grab whichever one you want and then you hit them back in to be here. It's secure,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.780]   it's strong, and it's small enough I can put it in my pocket. I don't have my- I had one of those George
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.500]   Costanza wallets. Remember that where he got like back injuries from like having this thing in his back
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.180]   pocket and I would have to keep it in my backpack or my wife would have to carry it in her bag,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.740]   which he wasn't very happy about. This just fits in my pocket and I have all my cards and IDs in there.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.540]   I mean, this is a game changer. I'm really happy about it. This is a true story. Tuesday, we're
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:59.260]   recording this on a Friday. Tuesday, I went out to dinner with some friends, including a friend of mine
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:05.500]   who works at a major tech company. We go up the pay at the counter, both pull out our ridges, right?
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.660]   I was like, Ridge? He's like, Ridge. And then we did like a Dutch style clog dance.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.060]   That's what you do when you meet another ridgers. Anyways, I love Ridge, but here's the thing.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.900]   This is crazy, Jesse. Ridge does these sweepstakes. I didn't know about this. Legendary sweepstakes,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:26.380]   like crazy prizes. Their fifth one, they're doing this for the fifth time right now. Here are the prizes
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:34.220]   for the sweepstakes that Ridge is currently doing. Two lucky winners get to choose between a $280,000
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:43.420]   Lamborghini Huracan Starato or a $100,000 Hennessy Velociraptor, which is where Hennessy Automotive
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:50.940]   takes a Ford Raptor pickup truck and like soups it up to a crazy amount of horsepower. Or you could choose
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.260]   a hundred dollars in cash, a hundred thousand dollars in cash. If two people get to choose between those,
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.660]   Jesse, your truck should be in there. That's what I thought. You can also choose Jesse's a
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.340]   1974 Ford Rustmaster. What's it called? Something like that.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.940]   Pretty much.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:12.460]   Yeah. You get a Lamborghini, uh, Starato or Jesse's 1974 Ford Rustmaster now with occasionally working
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:19.100]   air conditioning. So I think that's the one that's going to be chosen. Um, anyways, this sweepstake is
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.900]   going on. There's no reason not to enter. You go to a ridge.com, you can enter for free. So why not take your
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.980]   shot? And if you want to boost your odds, every dollar you spend on Ridge's site gets you one
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.860]   additional entry. They have a lot of cool products, but I really do love this Ridge wallet. Um, I've been
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.660]   using it every day since we got it. So if you're ready to upgrade your wallet and maybe your ride
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:43.980]   for a limited time, only head to ridge.com and use the code Cal at checkout for 10% off your order
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.140]   and a chance to win Ridge's biggest sweepstake ever. A Lamborghini Huracan,
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:54.300]   Starato, a Hennessy Velociraptor or $100,000 in cash. That Velociraptor has 560 horsepower.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.380]   Not bad.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.340]   I believe is more than my Kia Carnival hybrid minivan,
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.460]   which I believe is powered by a hamster that turns a wheel. I'm not quite sure, but I think that's how my
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.860]   minivan is powered. So the Velociraptor would be a little bit better. No purchase necessary to enter,
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:15.340]   but every dollar you spend gets you more entries. That's ridge.com and use Cal after you purchase.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.660]   Uh, use Cal and after you purchase, they will ask you, we heard about the show. You got to list our
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:25.500]   show. That's how you know they came from us. I also want to talk to you about Element, spelled L-M-N-T,
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:31.420]   a zero sugar electrolyte drink mix and sparkling electrolyte drink born from the growing body of
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:36.540]   research, revealing that optimal health outcomes occur at sodium levels two to three times government
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:44.220]   recommendations. Element is a no sugar, no dye, no other dodgy ingredients drink mix or sparkling drink
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.300]   that gives you the electrolytes you need without all of that other junk. Uh, this is an honest to
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:55.180]   God endorsement. I drink Element essentially every day. Typically after I work out, I'll drink it to
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.780]   replace what I sweat. But also if I wake up in the morning feeling particularly dehydrated,
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.660]   I'll throw Element right into some ice water in my Nalgene. I titrate it depending on how
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.060]   thirsty I feel like how much of the drink mix I use. I use the mix instead of the, the
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:13.820]   pre-packaged sparkling drinks. Um, and I love it. I honestly don't trust other athletic drinks because
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.620]   I don't know what goes into them. With Element, I don't have to worry. Right now I have a bunch of
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.300]   the watermelon flavor, but there was a new flavor that they introduced over the summer that I want
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:27.820]   to recommend. It was called Lemonade Salt. So on those really hot days, I think that was a really good one.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.380]   To be honest, uh, when they announced that Lemonade Salt was their newest flavor, Jesse,
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.660]   I'm kind of glad they chose that over the, the flavor I had suggested to the executives,
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.700]   which was tobacco diaper. Lemonade Salt is better. They probably made the right choice.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:48.060]   Um, so I'm not, you know, good at coming up at flavors. Element is better at that.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:55.820]   So if you want to try some Element, go to drinkelement.com/deep. That's drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:02.540]   If you go to that special URL, you will get a free Element sample pack with any order. Remember,
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.300]   you can try Element risk-free. They're happy to refund your money if you don't like it, but you will,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.380]   unless of course you order the tobacco diaper flavor. So go to drinkelement.com/deep today.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.340]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:24.780]   First question is from Joel. My work requires me to get a text message through Microsoft Authenticator
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.180]   multiple times per day. This has me on the phone more than I want. How should I deal with the
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:35.660]   distraction to always look at my text messages? Interestingly, as part of his employment with me,
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.940]   Jesse has required once every three minutes to call me on a landline to sort of check in his,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:46.620]   to give me his 20. He has to say, this is a big bird over my 20 years and he has to give me the 20.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.900]   Um, I got to keep an eye on my people I work with. Uh, okay. Well, it's kind of terrible that you have
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.300]   to answer these text messages throughout the day. I don't buy, however, that this means you must now
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:02.220]   go into all of your text communication multiple times a day if you don't want to. So you got three
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:08.460]   things you can do here. One, don't look at the other text messages when you get the Microsoft
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:14.940]   Authenticator text. Just, you see things come up and you say, I don't care. This is when I do my text
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:20.380]   messages. This is not one of those times. I will just pretend I didn't see that. That might seem
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.660]   impossible. Practice it for a few days. Won't be so bad. Two, if you're really not, you know, sure about
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:30.540]   your capability to do that. You can set up a custom, do not disturb mode that allows messages
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.780]   from that particular number to come through and not others. And you just put it in that mode and
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:40.940]   only those messages will come through. Or I bet if you talk to it, there's other factors to use in
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.060]   this two factor authentication. There's like, yeah, that's the default, but we could do other ways.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.620]   It can call or like an email and you could find another way to do it. Just say, I don't want to do
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.260]   with text messages. 80% chance there, they'll hook you up with something else. So do not use this.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.820]   It kind of looks like you're angling for this answer. Do not use this as an excuse to like,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.540]   I guess I just have to like be involved in text messages all day. You can get around that. All
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:07.820]   right. Who do we got? Next up is Emily. How did your experiment with summer schedules work out?
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.300]   And what is your, what are you planning for your teaching schedule?
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:16.380]   So something I'm really trying this semester, Emily, and we'll see, we'll see how it goes. I have not been
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:23.660]   in recent years as I guess, I'm trying to be accommodating. I have not been as firm as I
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.820]   should be with just, these are my deep work hours and I do deep work. And that's just that, right?
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.100]   And a lot of people will be annoyed and that's just what it is. I mean, I'm the guy who wrote the book,
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.820]   Deep Work. So you can't say you weren't warned. I'm trying to hold the line on that this year.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:47.100]   First thing in the morning, I do my deep work hours. There are two exceptions I have to work
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.820]   around. Our faculty meetings are once a month, but they're held in the morning on Fridays. But I've
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:57.180]   worked it out that I can get up and start writing right away and make it to the faculty meeting having
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.940]   got in like a reasonable deep work block. So I don't have to break that chain. So now I'm really down to
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:09.500]   just the end of semester school events for my kids, because they often hold those right after school
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   starts. So parents can come in and do that before work. That makes it impossible. Obviously,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.740]   I want to be at those. But if I'm down to just those, when I have like a presentation of my kid
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.940]   at school is the only time I don't start with deep work, I'm going to be happy. So I'm going to try
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.820]   to hold the line on that. The problem is by the time I made that decision, I already had a non-trivial
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:33.900]   number of things scheduled in the morning for the next month or so. So I'm holding the line now,
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:39.500]   but it might not be for another few weeks until I'm in a territory where that's being preserved.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:46.460]   The other thing is I'm trying to do what I call a studio day, where I dedicate an entire day,
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.980]   the same day every week, just to doing the stuff related to the outreach to the public. So working
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:58.460]   on podcast scripts, writing my newsletter, any of the sort of stuff that surrounds that. Instead of
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.420]   making that ad hoc, have a day. And I've announced this. I've told like my department chair, like I have
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.900]   a studio day. This is part of my job as a digital ethicist and in the Center for Digital Ethics to do
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.460]   outreach about technology and its impacts. There's a day where the office I'm working out of is my
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.060]   office here in Tacoma Park, where my studio is. And I don't schedule any other meetings on this day.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.340]   And that I'm trying, but as Jesse knows, I've been struggling with this because as soon as I declared
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.220]   that, I already had for the next couple of months, stuff that fell on every day. So again, it won't be
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:33.420]   until October, until any of this becomes steady. And I might actually have to change what that day is.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.940]   This is another conversation, Jesse, but I might have to change. It's hard stuff. So anyways, Emily,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:45.020]   I'm working on it, but my resolution this fall is I'm just going to be more annoying about it. This is
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:50.860]   just my thing. And then, here's the thing. I get chirped at so much now by so many people from so many
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.260]   different walks of life, from like national level commentators, to just random people that we know,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.300]   to random strangers. I'm kind of used to it now. So this is what I want to do. I want to make sure that
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.820]   I'm writing every single day and that the outreach part of my media company gets a full day of my
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.020]   attention. That's just my standard. And then I'll make everything else fit. And if it doesn't fit,
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.500]   then I'll reduce it. So that's what I'm practicing this year is, and I'll report back how it's going,
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:19.100]   is just, I'm going to hold the line more. And again, it's easy to say, and then be really accommodating,
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.500]   and then the whole thing falls apart. I'm actually going to be less accommodating.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.020]   But for the summer, you wrote all the time, didn't you?
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:25.980]   Yeah, I just wrote all the time.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.860]   So that worked out well.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:32.700]   That worked out fine. Yeah, we travel, we go up north and the writing didn't go well,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.980]   but the schedule went well.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.100]   So the schedule was fine. So the summer, I just write every day for the first half of the day,
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.540]   and we just built a whole summer around that.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.700]   But realistically, now you're on schedule to where you
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.740]   hope to be like going into the summer, right, with your writing?
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   Yeah, it's complicated.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.860]   I'm reworking some things. We'll get there. We'll get there.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.460]   I mean, you wrote a lot of New Yorker articles.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.060]   I wrote some New Yorker articles. Oh yeah, I was doing a lot of stuff. I'm never not writing.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.460]   It's like we talked about in the deep dive. I'm never not writing.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.380]   The newsletter is looking great.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.660]   I want to, yeah, you know, and shout out to, so we have a weekly newsletter,
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:10.060]   shout out to Nate. He handles all the formatting and it actually looks professional.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:14.940]   So I think all that's good. But I want more of the summer flavor in my regular year.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.900]   I can't write as much, obviously. I have more obligations, but I want to write every day.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.780]   And then what about deep work for like research? Is that like in the afternoon?
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:27.580]   Well, it depends what we're talking about for research. So if it's the things I'm working
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.340]   on in my writing blocks in the morning is it's like books and articles. And so if I'm
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:37.020]   doing research for a book chapter or an article, that can happen during that time. Like this week,
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.700]   I was, you know, I spent one of the writing blocks just finding sources and then the next
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.580]   two blocks like working on writing about it. All of the other type of stuff I'm working on,
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:51.900]   yeah, afternoon. And by afternoon, I mean, sometimes I can get this block in, I'm done by 9:30.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.460]   So it might just be like a normal work day is kind of starting, right? If I need to start early,
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:02.780]   I'll start early, but I'm getting the hours. Yeah. And I'm using the old meta productivity trick,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.180]   fixed scale to productivity. These are my hours. This is when I deep work. These are the studio days.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:12.220]   Everything else fits in. And if I'm not getting this, then I'm not getting to this. Something has to give.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:20.380]   So that's something I'm tuning myself into more this semester. All right. Who we got?
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:25.580]   Next up is Larry. I went back to episode one, where you introduced the idea of the deep life.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:31.180]   It's been almost five years since that episode aired. And I'm curious, what did your ideal lifestyle
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.620]   look like back then? How has it evolved since? And what changes do you make to where you are today?
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.620]   Does some of this get answered in your upcoming book?
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:44.460]   Yeah. It's an interesting question. I haven't gone back and listened to that episode in a while
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:53.740]   because the mic wasn't great and the audio is a little live. So where I recorded that first episode,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:59.660]   this would have been late spring. It was like May, 2020.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.780]   Right in the middle of COVID.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:08.220]   Right in the middle of COVID. And the county we live in, in Maryland, Montgomery County
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:14.060]   was all in on like, if you even open your blinds, you probably should go to Guantanamo.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:19.420]   Like it was very much like just locked down and everyone was trying to out lock down each other to
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:25.740]   like, I don't, I guess, signal their worthiness or whatever. So like, this is, this is terrible.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:32.540]   Right? So we, we rented a house down in Southern Maryland where no one, no one cares about anything.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:37.820]   Like it's just, it's empty, whatever. It's not like we were there all the time. It was like,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:42.300]   we temporarily had a second house we could go down to. And it was a weird piece of property
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:48.780]   because it was like a, just a modest house. And then not making this up, uh, an airstrip.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:54.620]   It's like a runway, but it was all grass, but like cut out of the trees, runway, like so really long.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:51:00.380]   And at the end of the runway, it was on water and you can, there's a fire pit down there and there's
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.940]   like water and they had, uh, golf carts cause it was so far away. So you would ride the golf carts down
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.140]   to the end of this runway. And there was like water down there. It was, we just wouldn't,
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.900]   we just spend more and more time at this crazy property. So we've got to have space and be outside.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:17.020]   Um, and they opened up stuff there like way sooner. So I could go back to like museums and stuff.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.780]   We've talked about this before, but I went to five museums in like three weeks when they opened up
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.580]   again in, you know, that's where I recorded the first episode on a table in that house,
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.580]   a hard table on a hard floor. It was a little live. That's what I was trying to get to live, meaning,
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:35.340]   um, echoey. So that's why I haven't listened to it. Uh, I will say in the pandemic is when I set
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:41.180]   like a lot of the pieces that became part of my ideal lifestyle vision
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.100]   that I've made huge progress on, but continue to pursue a lot of those pieces came down in the
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:51.180]   pandemic. So that was a definitely a face shift point in like whatever my, my ideal lifestyle
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:56.620]   vision was. I'm sure pre pandemic, it was much more, I don't remember exactly all the pieces of it. It was,
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:02.700]   it was much more just, you know, functional. I, I just moving forward to my academic career, um,
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:09.660]   having a book that was successful, getting the family, I had a family still relatively young back then.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.860]   We had just moved, uh, like my books were just starting to take off. So I'm sure it was just,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:19.020]   I don't know. It was a little bit more prosaic. And then it got a little bit more interesting.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:26.140]   Um, during the pandemic, even doing the podcast itself came from driving that golf cart back and forth,
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:31.260]   listening to, uh, mainly the rewatchables podcast with Bill Simmons and just like hearing what they
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.780]   were doing. And I was like, Oh, this is interesting. Like what people are up to in this medium and trying
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:40.300]   to like, imagine what it could be. I read a bunch of Disney books during that period. I still, as we'll
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.980]   see at the end of this episode, I'm still reading a lot of Disney books, but I was reading a lot of
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.660]   Disney books back then that during the early pandemic is when my, that weird obsession. And,
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:53.020]   and I began thinking about the media side of what I do and a lot of ideas that now we see today and
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:59.580]   you know, the deep work HQ and the, and the, the podcast, the video and the newsletters and the way
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:04.060]   things are progressing now. And there's the footprint it has in my life and in my career. Like a lot of
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:09.820]   those seeds were planted back early pandemic. Um, thinking about like what I wanted to do with my books
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:16.620]   and what I wanted, uh, the work to shallow ratio, the shape of my career. This is when like my, my,
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:22.380]   I began to change beyond just the simple path of just, you're a computer science professor who
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.580]   goes to these conferences and publishes these papers and has these students. That's when I
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:30.220]   first started shifting towards a more ambitious and idiosyncratic vision for my academic impact.
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:36.140]   So without getting into too much details, a lot changed right around the time I did that podcast,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.660]   early pandemic. And I made a lot of progress actually on a lot of those ideas.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:45.260]   that, that, um, that came up then. So still going well. All right. Who do we got?
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:50.540]   Next up is Kerry. I have enough time in my morning hours to focus on deep work and projects that matter
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:56.620]   to my work. I also get the inbox zero most days. However, I want to start using my afternoons for
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.700]   other pursuits. My problem is that I obsessively check my inbox for new emails.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:05.420]   Well, you do that because you, you worry about bad things that could happen.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:11.660]   And so when you do that type of obsessive checking, you worry about bad things that are happening. But
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:16.540]   when you're actually doing the checking, what you're looking for is the positive feeling of relief when
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:21.020]   you see nothing is there. So your mind is like, what if there's something there? What if someone
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.220]   needs you? What if there's something urgent? You know, like, do we need to do something? And you're
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.540]   like, you know what? If I check and there's not, I'm going to feel good. And I kind of want that good feeling. You can get addicted to that positive feeling in the same way you can get addicted to the positive feeling of, you know,
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:36.780]   eating a donut or smoking a cigarette. It really can be a donut or smoking a cigarette. It really can be powerful.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:43.660]   So we have to break you out of that cycle. And the way I often suggest in these situations that people do that
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:50.220]   is commit for one to two weeks saying I am going to make lots of bad things happen.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:57.740]   Even if things go terribly awry, I can always apologize my way out of like one week. I could be like,
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.020]   sorry, like it was a hard week. I wasn't feeling well or whatever. But for one week,
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:07.180]   I'm not going to try to convince myself that nothing bad will happen if I don't check my inbox in the
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.220]   afternoon. I'm going to say, let the bad things happen. I want to see how many bad things happen if
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:18.620]   I don't do that. My new rule is going to be do an emergency check at 4:30, just to make sure there's
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.460]   nothing really urgent. If there is, you can like give your quick apology, like I'm on it, I'll get to it
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.940]   tomorrow so people aren't stressed out at the end of the day. And that's it. And be like, I'm sure bad things
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.340]   will happen. People will be upset, things will get missed, but it's not going to jeopardize my job
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.340]   because it's one week and I can be like, hey, it was a hard week. So make that commitment. Your mind
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.700]   will be on board with that. If you try to convince your mind, it's fine, nothing bad will happen. It's
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:44.780]   like, I don't believe you. That is a wrong thing. And because that's a wrong thing, I am not going to
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:49.260]   base my activities on it. But if you're like, no, no, no, bad things will happen, but we won't get fired
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.700]   for it because it's just one week. Your mind's like, okay, fine. This is a stupid exercise, but we'll do it.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.860]   And here's what you'll find. Bad things don't happen because no one really cares.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.940]   : And if you're on the ball and you're responsible and you can, you can, you know,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.820]   touch base at 4:30 when you need to, when people send you a message, it's off their head, it's off
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:09.660]   their plate. Like, great. There's one less thing I have to stress about. Now I'm going to pay attention
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:16.220]   to the next 500 things. It is not as people imagine when they see an email sitting there in their inbox,
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:26.780]   and it's like 4:30 and it's been there since like 1:00 PM. What they imagine is that that sender since 1:00 PM has been sitting there staring at
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:34.860]   their inbox slowly pouring slugs of bourbon, gripping the glass as it shakes and being like,
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:40.620]   where the hell is your answer? And slug back and they slam it down and then looking at the clock and
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.740]   there's like a wildly ticking second hand behind them. And another half hour goes by and they pour
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:51.660]   another slug. It's been 30 minutes. So you imagine that's what's happening. That everyone is just sitting
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:58.140]   there like, I cannot believe this guy has not answered my message. I am probably going to have
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.980]   to dismember him with an ax because like, this is unconscionable. No, they have a thousand messages.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.100]   They're just glad they got this one thing off their plate. They don't want you to answer right away
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.020]   because then it's back on their plate again. So it's like, great. We'll let all the terrible things
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.380]   happen. Oh my God, it's gonna be so terrible. And then it won't be in your mind. Like, okay, fine.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.620]   You're right. This is okay. And then you'll stop worrying about it as much. Then the relief you get from
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:21.660]   checking will be less. And if the relief is less, the positive signal is no longer so salient. And
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:26.700]   then the addictive loop will degrade. So just tell yourself, yeah, mind. Let's just see how many bad
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:31.900]   things do happen and then see what really happens. So much of problems with work communication, Jesse,
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.100]   is what we imagine other people are doing in terms of tracking our behavior.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:40.220]   It's kind of amazing. They really think that there's a war room where everyone is sitting there
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.860]   with like real-time graphs. It's like the Apollo mission control from Apollo 13, except for it's like
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.820]   graphs of your inbox. You know, like they check in on all the people in the control stations at
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:55.580]   mission control, like polymetry, go, you know, whatever life support, go that you have everyone
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:00.540]   that's like response time, go number of committees. They agreed to go. Like they're all sitting here
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.700]   with these charts, like trying to figure out what's going. No one cares. Be reliable, get your stuff done.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.740]   No one's, no one's charting your email response times. And if they, if they are, you know,
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:15.580]   get out of that job. That's stupid. All right. Who do we got? Next up is Maureen. Can you summarize how
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:20.860]   values and strategic planning documents, birthday projects and lifestyle centric planning combined
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:27.500]   together? Nobody knows. Just leave it at that. It's just the way it is. No one knows how they
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:35.900]   fit together. We just accept it. Yes. All right. This is like a Cal Newport potpourri. All right.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:40.620]   Let's put these, let me go through these all here. Okay. So lifestyle centric planning
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:47.100]   is an approach to transforming your life in which you work systematically towards a holistic picture
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.940]   of a better lifestyle, as opposed to assuming that one radical change or accomplishment will
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:54.540]   make everything better. So it is an approach to transforming your life.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:59:00.540]   Your values, having a clear description of your values in a values document
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:07.820]   can help you when creating your ideal lifestyle that you're moving towards. It also just helps you day to
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.740]   day and trying to figure out like, how do I react to particular situations as they come up? It's a good
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:18.220]   reminder. Your strategic plan is a tool you use to move closer to your ideal lifestyle, among other
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.820]   things. So that might be useful towards that as I, you know, how do I make sure I'm making progress on
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.780]   these various things that moves me closer to my ideal lifestyle? Your birthday plan, that just means check
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.100]   in on all this on your birthday to make sure that you don't fall into stasis. Hey, let me look back at my
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:35.820]   ideal lifestyle. Do I like this vision? Do I need to change anything? How do I want to change my approach,
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:40.380]   my plan for this year to move closer? So I think that covers it all. Strategic planning,
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:46.700]   birthday projects, external planning, and values. There you go. In my new book, which right now feels
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.980]   like it'll come out in 2035, but no, I'm making progress on it. It will come out on time.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:56.140]   In my new book, I get into some of this. So you'll definitely get into lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.140]   Why that's the better way to do it, as opposed to hoping for one radical change.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.300]   How do you build these lifestyle plans? How do you figure out what even matters to you?
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:11.740]   How do you write a good, ideal lifestyle plan? What's the process? How do you go from like your
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.820]   notes with your intuitions about what resonates to like an actually usefully formatted plan?
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:21.020]   How do you then build a plan to systematically move closer to that vision?
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:27.820]   Because I'm all about it's idiosyncratic. And it's making very careful, like if I do this,
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.500]   it could help four things at the same time. Then if I combine it with this, it'll prevent this from
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.980]   backsliding. It's more of a puzzle than it is a key. That's a big, big argument in my book.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.140]   Changing your life is sometimes fitting together the puzzle pieces of your obstacles and opportunity,
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.780]   not finding the one key that unlocks everything. It's not as dramatic as that. So we'll get into that
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.900]   as well. As well as like the advanced techniques that you throw in to sort of help make that
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.540]   progress. So that's where we might hear about like birthday plans and values documents, et cetera.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.980]   And then another big part of that book will be like, wait, but what if all of this is just,
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:03.180]   you're like, I can't even do any of this? Crash course in capability. And maybe you want to do that.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.620]   And I imagine that being something that you do throughout life. Like I have a hard period.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.980]   I got knocked on my, you know, knocked on my butt a bunch this quarter, life, work or whatever.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.420]   I need to kind of re get the engine of capability going here. Crash course.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.700]   Or maybe you've never gotten there. You're 27. And it was like straight from college to video games.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:28.620]   You know, like I got to just get started, you know, crash course. Right. Or you really have your act
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.020]   together, but then you went into a new phase of life management position, started a family or something.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.940]   You're like, oh my God, bought a house. You're like, I don't know how to like keep the walls up.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.900]   Crash course. So these are the pieces I'm working with, working with now.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.140]   All right. Who do, is that our last question? All right, great. So we have,
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.860]   uh, do we have a call this week? Yeah, we have a case study.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.620]   All right. Which one should we do first, Jesse? You can choose.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:55.820]   Do the case study first. Do we have our fabled case study music?
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.140]   I think we do. All right. Do I, do I read it?
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.580]   Is it a one time music or do I read within the background?
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.700]   Pretty brave. I see.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:12.940]   That'd be funny if the case, after that music, the case study started with,
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.020]   Well, yesterday I killed a man.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:24.060]   Ryan, you from prison. Must be nice. How do I do deep work when I'm in prison
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.540]   for killing a man? We need different music for that. I like that music. We'll play it again at
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.900]   the end. It makes it kind of talked over it. All right. Today's case study. I like this one's from
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.260]   Nick. It's about household admin, which is something I've been working a lot on recently.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:42.380]   Nick said, I started using your idea of using a mail sorter to organize household admin.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:47.580]   When I first heard this mentioned on the podcast, I was drowning in household admin work. The concept
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.260]   of a mail sorter really clicked with me. So I immediately put a cardboard box on the kitchen
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.460]   counter with all my pending paperwork in it. I also told my wife that if she had any paperwork for me to
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.900]   handle, she could just dump it in that box as well. This instantly made both of our lives a lot easier.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.060]   For the first few weeks, I was still in the habit of handling admin stuff as it came in.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.700]   So it was easy to slip back into the habit of following up on the stuff every night. But over
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:16.220]   time, as I built up the routine of checking the mail sorter weekly, I started to trust the system
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:22.060]   and I got to the place where I could rely on it. After a month or two of using the cardboard box,
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.420]   I decided it was time to over-engineer a more permanent solution. What I came up with was a real
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.380]   mailbox, the style that goes on a wall with a lid on the top, and I mounted it on the kitchen wall
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:37.180]   with two magnets. This frees up space on the kitchen counter and keeps all the housework paperwork out
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:41.100]   of sight. It's just the right size to hold a week or two of paperwork. And with the magnets,
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.180]   it's really convenient to pull off the wall when it's time to process. For a long time,
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.020]   I had a weekly reminder in my calendar to process the mail sorter. However, the system was working so
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.580]   well that I recently reduced the frequency to every other week. So using a mail sorter to manage my
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.660]   paperwork has dramatically reduced my household admin burden, and keeping that in check is an
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:03.420]   important piece of my journey towards the deep life. Nick, fantastic case study. Having a place
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.300]   where stuff goes, where you trust that you're going to get to it, this is a David Allen idea,
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:14.300]   is like the best stress-reducing drug you can find. Because your mind doesn't worry about it.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.540]   It's in that box, and I look at that box on Fridays, and I trust that I'm going to look at that box on
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:23.740]   Fridays. And so if I put the thing in the box, it'll be seen on Friday. And what you're gaining
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.020]   here, it's not a time thing. It's what people get wrong about time management or productivity. It's
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.620]   not a time thing. It's not, "I got the total minutes dedicated, the paperwork is smaller."
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.980]   It's not the game. The game is a psychological relief game. You don't have to worry about it.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:43.740]   It's all in one place, and then you can get it done all at once. And it might not be faster,
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.740]   but it is cognitively more pleasant because as we've also talked about on the show,
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.220]   when you do a big batch of, let's say, household paperwork, you can transform your mind into the
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.060]   cognitive context of household paperwork, and then do all of these things in that context.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.380]   And once you're in the context, these things are much easier to do from just a psychological effort
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:05.900]   required perspective. Whereas if you take the same household admin things and do them in an ad hoc on
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.420]   demand pattern, just in the middle of something else, "Oh, let me do this now," you're never in the right
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.580]   cognitive mindset. So it's like pulling cognitive teeth, right? You're like, "Oh God, I got to do
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:19.180]   this paperwork, but I was just thinking about this thing I was doing over here," and it constantly
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:23.660]   creates friction and it constantly creates sort of mental strain. So it feels better to do it that
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:28.700]   way as well. So I think that is a great example. And the key is trust. Yeah, put the weekly calendar
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.420]   thing. You're never going to forget it, but it gives you peace at first because it's like, "Oh,
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:38.060]   my calendar will remind me to check this." You'll remember, but it just gives you peace to know that,
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:42.300]   like, it's on my calendar. I won't forget it. So I think that's a fantastic way to do it.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.700]   When we bought our first house, it was like kind of my job because my wife would go to work early.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:51.980]   I'd have the first shift with the kids. And so I just had this mail sorter and a 30-minute block
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:57.900]   every morning right after the nanny came, I think is how I did it, before I'd kind of get started with
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.900]   Georgetown work. And it was like, just do house, because there's so much household stuff to do when you
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:07.500]   buy a new house. Like, I don't have this. The water bill is not working right. Or we need this type of
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:12.060]   insurance that we didn't have before. Or like there's snakes in the faucets. It's always something,
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.900]   right? And so I was like, just every day for 30 minutes, I work on this stuff. And when stuff came
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:22.060]   in, I just put it in there. And man, I was just on top of it. So that works. Trusted systems do work.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:35.260]   Can we play the music to play us out here? I enjoyed it.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.260]   All right. We got a call? We do. Now let's hear it.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:47.020]   Hello. My name is Dave Curlin. I'm a real estate salesperson. And my question is in regard to the
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:52.620]   capture and review parts of your productivity system. I know you use Trello. And I personally
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:58.380]   have adopted using it myself. But as the number of Trello cards get bigger and bigger, the list gets
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:04.060]   longer, I find it difficult to effectively look at them and make decisions about what to do and not to
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:09.580]   do. You have alluded to David Allen's system in the past, and I'm familiar with his method of capturing
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:15.500]   things in context categories. Is there a reason you don't create more columns in Trello and use this
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.860]   method? It seems like it would be a more efficient way to review these tasks, etc.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:26.300]   When doing daily and weekly planning and dealing with a really big list of possible activities and
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:33.900]   projects. Love your podcast. It's been so helpful. And the time blocking method has helped me immensely.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:40.780]   Thanks. Well, for my professional task, when organized in Trello, I do have many columns. I also have many
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:47.820]   boards. You need to organize information in various scales of context helps you make better use of it.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:54.060]   Right? So I tend in the professional context to have a board for each major role. So I'm director of
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.660]   undergraduate studies for the computer science department. That's a different role than say a role
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:03.740]   working in the Center for Digital Ethics or my role working as an algorithm researcher. So give them
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:11.500]   a separate board. I only want to see things related to a given role at one time. And so when I want to
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.300]   service that role, that's what I'm doing this afternoon, then let me just see those things. And
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:21.500]   then within those boards, I have a lot of columns. And there's like classic columns, like make sense
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.740]   of, I haven't processed it yet. There's like sort of urgent working on this week, but I have a lot of
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.460]   like waiting to hear back from is in there. I sent an email to someone I'm waiting to hear back. Let me
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:35.180]   remind myself of what that is and what I'm going to do when I hear back to discuss that next meeting for
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:40.300]   like any regular meetings in my life assigned for that role. I'll have a column, right? So my director of
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:44.540]   undergraduate studies, there's, I have meetings with my associate director every week. And then
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:50.380]   every other week I meet with my department chair. I keep track of, for both of those things, things I
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:55.020]   want to talk about at that next meeting. That saves me a ton of email, by the way. So instead of like
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.500]   just sending the people's instinct is as soon as I think of something, let me email my department chair.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.500]   Hey, it's off my hands. But now you've just added another email to the thousand that she's going to get
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.940]   and she's responds. And now like you have to work this out, not at the time you want to, but whenever
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:12.380]   these emails move back and forth. So instead you put on a card, talk at next meeting. When you get
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.980]   to the meeting, you go through them all. It gives you relief. You can have columns for like particular
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:22.140]   projects that are going on. If it's like, this is like a time sensitive, complicated project that I,
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.500]   you know, we're trying to get this conference together. Great. Here's a separate column over
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.780]   here. So I can just keep track of those things. So create as many columns as you need
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:35.820]   and create different boards for different contexts. I think all of this helps. So lots of things together
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.260]   that have unrelated contexts, you all have to look at the same time. That can be,
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.100]   that can be really overwhelming. So I'm not sure where you got the idea that I have a very small
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:52.140]   number of total columns I use. I have a ton in my, in my Trello universe. All right. We got our final
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:58.140]   segment coming up. The books I read in August, but first something even more exciting, a word from
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:04.380]   another one of our sponsors. So look, if you run a small business, you know, there's nothing small about it.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.180]   Every day there is a new decision to make. And even the smallest decisions feel massive.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:15.100]   Jesse knows I get upset when people refer to our business as small. Just the other day,
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:19.340]   for example, just, you might remember this, that the nice woman who runs the gift shop down the
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.500]   street here in Tacoma Park was like, Hey, how's life as a small business owner going?
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:29.660]   So Jesse and I, we rolled our car into a swamp. You don't call my business small. I don't want to hear
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:34.860]   about that way. So here's what I'm trying to say. It's hard to run a small business. So when you can
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:40.220]   find decisions that are no brainers, you should take them. And when it comes to selling things,
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:46.700]   using Shopify is exactly one of those no brainers. Jesse, that was word for word. That whole thing was
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.020]   word for word, the script they sent me, the car and the swamp. And you know, that's just word for word,
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:56.940]   the Shopify script. Shopify's point of sale system is a unified command center for your retail business.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   It brings together in store and online operations across up to 1000 locations. It's very impressive
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:08.860]   features like endless aisle, ship the customer and buy online, but pick up in store. So these features
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.540]   that make you seem like you're a much bigger company, seamless when you're using Shopify. And with Shopify
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.340]   POS, you can get personalized experiences that help your shoppers come back. We have data about this
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:27.580]   report from EY said that businesses on Shopify POS see real results like a 22% better total cost of
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:33.500]   ownership and benefits equivalent to a 8.9 uplift in sales on average relevant to the market set surveyed.

[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:55.740]   I also want to talk about our friends at Caldera Labs. Guys, why don't you want like to look a little
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:01.660]   younger, maybe get a few more compliments on your skin. As I've mentioned, as part of his employment
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:06.060]   contract with me, Jesse has to compliment my skin no fewer than seven times a day. But for the rest of you,
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:12.540]   your best way to getting compliments on your skin is to actually take care of it. That's exactly what
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:19.260]   Caldera Lab is here for. Their high performance skincare is designed specifically for men. These
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:24.940]   are simple, effective products that are backed by science. In a consumer study, 100% of men said their
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:33.820]   skin looks smoother and healthier. 96.9% noticed improved hydration and texture and 93.8% reported a more
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:40.620]   youthful appearance. Their products include The Good, an award-winning serum packed with 27
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:45.580]   active botanicals. The Eye Serum, which helps reduce the appearance of tired eyes and dark circles
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:51.900]   and puffiness. And The Base Layer, a nutrient-rich moisturizer infused with plant stem cells and snow
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.780]   mushroom extract. You just put this on every day to keep the skin hydrated. These products will make you
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.820]   look better and feel better about yourself. And they're cheaper than hiring Jesse to comment on
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:06.460]   your skin throughout the day. So that is a bonus. Skincare doesn't have to be complicated, but it should
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:14.620]   be good. Upgrade your routine with Caldera Lab and see the difference for yourself. Go to calderalab.com/deep
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:22.380]   and use deep at checkout for 20% off your first order. All right, Jesse, let's go to our final segment.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:30.860]   So like I like to do, our first episode of each month, talk about the books I read in the previous
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:35.260]   month. We should get theme music for this, Jesse. Yeah, we should. That's a good idea. It's only
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.860]   once a month. I think it'd be funny if it was something that like made no sense. Like it was really
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:47.260]   incongruous and we just don't mention it. It's going to be funny. Like girls just want to have fun.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:55.020]   I won't be the craziest thing. La Bamba. It'd be great. So we're going to do that next time. We're
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.380]   going to have incongruous theme music and we're just going to roll with it. That's what we do. All right.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:05.900]   So in August, it's a weird month. I'm looking at my books here. I was on vacation in August for a lot of it.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:14.460]   So I was reading. I was on vacation. I was writing a lot. I was struggling with my writing.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.420]   I didn't want to read. It's an interesting set of books. Let's just say a judge. That's what I'm
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.980]   trying to say. These are the books that someone odd like me reads when on vacation and is just like,
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:29.020]   I'm not interested in hard new ideas right now. So let's just keep this in mind. This is a summer list.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:35.020]   All right. This first book, I don't know how to even explain this book. It's called Boundless Realm
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:42.060]   by Fox Nolte. It is a book. I think it's regularly published. Maybe it's self-published. I read it on
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:48.300]   Kindle. It is a book about the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney World, not the Disneyland version,
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.140]   but the Disney World. But it's the craziest book, Jesse, because it's not here's a history of the ride.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:15:02.380]   It is, here's a history of the haunted house in the American Gothic imagination. Let's start there.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:08.300]   All right. Now we're going to have like a history of like, it's like cultural trends that surround
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:14.700]   the very notion of like haunted spaces. Now let's get a whole history of the dark room attraction,
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.420]   starting in these like small amusement park attractions, where it would literally just be a
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:24.060]   dark room that you're on a track and then how things were added. It's like strands of sociology
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:30.060]   and history all wind together. And then it's like a beat by beat examination of this ride.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.820]   And it goes like on each section, it kind of like goes deep and like what's there and how it's
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:41.500]   represented the artistic cultural impact, but also like historically speaking, like when something
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:46.780]   got changed and at this year they came, I mean, it's the craziest thing. It's like the level of
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:53.020]   detail you would write if you were writing about like a presidential assassination, like that level of
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:57.580]   research, but about this ride. And it was fascinating. And he has another one out. He has,
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.940]   I think he writes a bunch of these books. So I don't know. It's a labor of love.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.980]   How long is the ride? Like five minutes? I was on it like 30 years ago.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:08.300]   Yeah. Yeah. It's like five minutes. And I've only been on the one at this, I went to Disneyland this
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.060]   summer and that's the only one anytime I've ever been to any Disney. And this is about the Disney World
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:15.900]   one, which is a little bit different. And you find out exactly how it's different.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:22.060]   Trust me, you get into it. It's a cool, I mean, I think it's a cool ride. I did it a bunch of times.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:27.500]   Um, it was just like a, I was reading that one up in Vermont. Interesting book. All right. Then I read,
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:33.820]   uh, Collisions by Alec Navala Lee. Oh, this is a legitimate book. This is a, it's a biography of a
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:43.740]   physicist who named Alvarez and he, he was, uh, involved in the Manhattan project. So he, he designed
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:51.500]   the instrument that the chase plane that chased, like, so, you know, there's a, the Enola Gay dropping
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:56.060]   the atomic bomb, but there was, you have like a couple of planes with you. And one of the other planes
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:00.860]   dropped a, you know, a piece of equipment on a parachute to try to measure the blast and other
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:05.660]   things and then like radio it back. And so he was up in the chase plane because he designed this thing.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.860]   Um, he went on to win a Nobel prize for his, he was a, he was a, a, a sort of, um, experimentalist
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.380]   physicist, big, famous physicist. And he won a Nobel prize for his work on something, I don't know,
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:18.540]   cloud chambers or particle, something, something. So there's a kind of an interesting guy. Like what
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:24.540]   made the book interesting is that his life went in, he got, he got involved in like a lot of weird or
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:29.180]   interesting different projects. So that he was heavily involved, not heavily involved, but he got
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:36.300]   involved in a Kennedy assassination debunking. So debunking the conspiracy theories about the Kennedy
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:42.300]   assassination from a physics perspective. Like he did a lot of work on, um, using rules of physics
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:48.700]   to understand things like the timing of the shots and the, like how a head could go backwards if it
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:54.460]   was shot in this direction. So he got really involved in that. Um, and then most famously later in life,
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:18:00.540]   working with his son, who was a geologist or something like this, he, they were the ones who
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:08.540]   advanced the asteroid killing the dinosaurs theory. So this was their working together, really made this
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:16.700]   argument based off of, uh, the iridium and the KT layer. They really began to, they pushed the argument, which,
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:22.780]   you know, we grew up with it, you and I like, yeah, the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid.
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:27.580]   What I don't think we realized growing up, that was a brand new theory when we were growing up.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:32.620]   Like in the early nineties, late eighties, that was still being debated. So like we grew up and
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.780]   they're like, yeah, like the asteroid killed the dinosaurs. That wasn't like, yeah, we've known this
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:42.780]   since the 1950s. In the nineties still, they are like actively making this argument. So anyways,
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.020]   I thought it was cool. So that was interesting. It was interesting to hear about him. Um, Alvarez,
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:54.380]   interesting guy, did a lot of deep work. Also, let me turn this off. I lost my list here. Let me go back.
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:02.700]   Uh, then I read, it's another Disney book, Jesse. I was on vacation. This is the mindset I was in.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:09.900]   I was reducing my stress. I, I got really into people writing ridiculously detailed books about
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:15.020]   a very narrow thing involving Disney. So this is a similar, this is a more legitimate book.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:19.180]   Um, no, the Fox Nolte is a legitimate book too. I just don't know if it's like traditionally published
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:24.460]   or not. This one was called Before the Birds Sing by Ken Bruce. Ken Bruce is, um, an animator,
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:31.020]   director, like a Hollywood guy. And it's all about the enchanted tiki room in Disneyland one.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:36.220]   And because that was like the first animatronics, uh, there was the Lincoln animatronic, but it was
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:41.500]   really like sort of the first sort of, uh, audio animatronics in Disney. And it's the whole history
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:48.300]   of the technology, the room, like beat by beat, how this came together. This, this, this, uh, author,
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:53.580]   Ken Bruce was like deep in the Disney archives. He got access to them. So he's like looking at
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:58.220]   annotations on notes about like, Oh, they moved like the tables around for this or that. It's
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.180]   like a, again, it's a micro history of this one ride, which by the way, I've never seen.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:08.300]   It was closed when I was at Disneyland. So I don't know anything, but I'm interested in audio
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:13.180]   animatronics. And so you, uh, you just get this like really, really deep history, including like,
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:18.300]   why was it the tiki room? So you get a whole history about the tiki craze and about, uh, the South
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.780]   Pacific really coming to the attention of like the American people. And there was this craze of all
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:27.820]   of these, like over the top themed tiki restaurants in the first half of the 20th century. Like in Los
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.620]   Angeles, there's this one that the whole outside is a volcano with like lava coming on. You come into
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:39.500]   these tiki restaurants and it would, they had like rainstorms inside and, and volcanoes and giant tanks.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.300]   It was all really themed. Then it was this whole mania. So, uh, you have to understand that to
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.460]   understand like, why is there a tiki room at Disneyland? Like it was really big. And then
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:53.420]   it got even bigger after world war II, because a lot of American GIs went to the South Pacific.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:57.500]   So then they came back and they had seen all this stuff and had these stories and Hawaii was just
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:04.620]   about to become, uh, the 49th U S state. And so it was like this moment. So you get like that history in
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:09.980]   it, but then you get the whole history of audio animatronics, which comes out of technology. They, they,
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:16.780]   they purchased surplus technology that was used in the Polaris, Polaris, uh, nuclear ballistic missile
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:21.980]   program. Cause like the way audio animatronics work, not to get too much in the detail here,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:29.580]   but it's how do we, in an age before we have digital computers, how do we store like all the movements
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:34.940]   we do, we want like one of a bird to do and not only store those movements, but sync it up exactly with
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.420]   like the sound we're going to be playing. And in audio animatronics, they said, what we'll do is,
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:45.580]   uh, for each movement, we'll have like a tone. And if we have a multi-track tape, we can fit a bunch
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:49.100]   of tones on here. In fact, we can overlap some tones on the same tape because there are different
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:55.100]   frequency bands that, that are, um, they don't, they constructively, we can kind of furrier transform
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.980]   them back out again. Like we can, we can store multiple frequency bands on the same, uh, channel and
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:04.860]   then still isolate both of them. Um, and so what the, what they then had is, so you're recording
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:11.180]   these tones on audio tape for all the different motions. You want these, uh, it's valves opening
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:16.460]   and shutting to move things. Then they had these things that Motorola had invented for their, uh,
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:22.220]   push to talk radios called tone reads. So you have the sound that's kind of like wired,
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:27.580]   it's going over an analog cable into these tone reads and it vibrates, different frequencies,
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.220]   vibrate different reads. And when it vibrates, it closes a circuit. And that circuit can then,
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:37.660]   when it closes, can open and close a valve to move something. So they've, the, the program for
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:43.820]   these birds was on an audio tape. And you, this tape is playing and they have these huge banks of
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:49.260]   tone reads that are vibrating different frequencies that are opening and closing valves. And they could
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:55.420]   fit something like 128 or 200 different kind of sub tracks of tones on there. And it's exactly
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.180]   synchronized to the sound because one of the tracks is just like the sound. So like it's exactly
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:03.180]   synchronized to it. So they kind of invented that was, they were using this to control missiles.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.540]   Um, and they, they use this for this, but then for Pirates of the Caribbean, there's too many figures
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:14.140]   for this, right? So Pirates of the Caribbean, now we're talking like 62. There's too many figures
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:18.700]   and they have audio tape and it's constant. It's not like shows like they're constantly moving
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.620]   and they're like, we can't just constantly be playing this audio tape. And there's too many figures to try to
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:27.900]   program. So they went to something more simple there. It was each of the feet and their motions
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:33.260]   were much simpler because you only passed them briefly. So they made physical discs that have
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:39.260]   like bumps up and down. And when the bump happens, like different valves open and close. And they just
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:45.340]   had like these, you'd have these big racks full of discs with bumps, like big records really. And they
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:49.660]   would just turn and push a stylus up and down, or there would be holes and you would, they would have a
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.820]   photo thing under it, but just physical discs that would turn. And each one would have like,
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:58.300]   it would take two minutes to go around. And that's like two minutes of activity. So you would have a
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.380]   whole stack of these discs for all the different motors on one Pirate. And it was like a much more
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:07.980]   durable thing because it was really physical, right? And then by like the seventies, you could just have
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.660]   zeros and ones on a computer, just loading the memory and the computer could just do it.
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.820]   So like this type of stuff is really interesting to me. My wife thought it was crazy. Like, what are you reading?
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:21.740]   Actually, this book is beautiful. It's a hardcover, beautifully produced. It's hard to get. I had to order it,
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:28.300]   you know, not through Amazon, through some other means. Beautiful hardcover, uh, embossed hard, uh,
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.940]   cloth hardbound, you know, with like the Tiki bird in or this or that self-published as far as I can tell.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:38.620]   It's a labor of love. Really? Yeah. There was no publisher. I think this, this, uh,
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:42.460]   Brad Bird, the director wrote, wrote the introduction. Like this is the guy who wrote
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.500]   it is like a real Hollywood is an animation insider. All right. Then I read a fun novel,
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:52.780]   which I got in Bethany. There's a good bookstore in Bethany called Beach Reads, which they don't
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:58.620]   carry my books, but they do have, uh, beach reads a novel, a lot of novels or this or that. Um,
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:05.660]   and I got a book randomly off the shelf impulse by desperation reef by T Jefferson Parker. It's like a
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:13.500]   procedural thriller family. They're surfers. There's like, I don't know, intrigue and their
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:19.180]   criminal syndicate like burns down their restaurant. And it was fun. It's interesting.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.900]   Um, and then finally I read, uh, shift by Hugh Howie. So I mentioned my, one of my kids read the
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:31.340]   Hugh Howie trilogy, which is the, on Apple TV, the series is silo, but he wrote the wool trilogy
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.060]   back in the day. That was big, like last decade. Anyways, he read them and I promised to read along.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.780]   So I, I, I read the first one the month before and this month I read the second one shift and I
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:46.620]   guess I'll read the third one sometime soon. So there you go. Those are my five books for August, 2025.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:51.180]   If you know of any obscure Disney books that go way too deep on a very narrow topic,
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:55.500]   I'm in man. Now you gotta just tell me, I got to read them all. There's a whole world out there.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.860]   So let me know, send those recommendations or just send me the book to, uh, Jesse.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:04.780]   We're gonna get a lot of really, we're gonna get a lot of really narrow books. I love the
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:09.500]   technology, the technology side of like the Disney park stuff. That's really what I'm kind of interested
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.820]   in this year. Like that's my interest during the pandemic. I was really interested in like
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   the media business brand. Now this year, because it's like relaxing to me, I'm really interested
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:27.340]   in the technological side of Disney parks. I've been the one one day. All right. That's all the time
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:32.220]   we have for today. We'll be back next week with another episode until then, as always stay deep.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:39.100]   If you liked today's discussion of work life balance, you'll also like episode 356, which is
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:45.660]   titled how much should we work? I go deep on that question in a sort of unexpected way. Check it out.
