[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   - Here's an email from the inbox.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.120]   Good afternoon, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.400]   I am Jane from South Africa, a born-again Christian.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.520]   How do you respond when people who sit next to you in church
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.080]   who are attending church by their own admission
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.600]   because they want to experience miracles,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.880]   what should we think of people who attend church
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.200]   for this express purpose of experiencing the miraculous?
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.220]   What would you say?
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.320]   - Well, before I can answer
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.360]   what I think about that person's motive
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   or what's going on there,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.200]   I need to number one, define miracle,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   and number two, distinguish kinds of miracles,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   and number three, get at the purpose,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.720]   God's purpose in the Bible of what miracles are for.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.680]   And then I think if we do that,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080]   we'll be close to our answer.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   A miracle is an event in the heart or the mind
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   or the body or nature in the world
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.560]   that would not have come about
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   if God had not supernaturally intervened
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.140]   in the ordinary process of natural cause and effect.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.800]   And I realize as soon as I say that definition,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   it runs the risk of treating the natural world
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.520]   as though it were not sustained and guided
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.740]   by the hand of God in everything.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.080]   It is sustained and guided by God in everything.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.920]   Jesus said, "Not a bird falls to the ground
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.960]   "apart from your father," Matthew 10, 29.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.040]   And what could be more natural than the fall of a bird,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.600]   the death of a bird in the jungle or the forest?
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   So when I define miracle as the supernatural intrusion
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   into the ordinary course of natural cause and effect,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.520]   I'm not denying that all natural cause and effect
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   is in fact the work of God,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.800]   is sustained and guided by God.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880]   Now, that definition means
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.800]   that there are different kinds of miracles,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.720]   some of them more obvious than others.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   The new birth, the creation of a Christian is a miracle
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.320]   because the natural mind of the human being
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.560]   is hostile to God.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220]   It would never ever come to faith
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.400]   without the supernatural sovereign grace of God
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.560]   raising us spiritually from the dead
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.800]   and giving us new life in the heart,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.480]   which then sees and embraces the beauty of Jesus.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.280]   Every step of sanctification is a miracle by my definition.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   Every act of genuine Christ-exalting love is a miracle.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   None of these things would happen
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800]   if we were left to ourselves
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   and the natural course of cause and effect
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.880]   in the mind and in the heart.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.760]   But also the removal of a cancerous tumor by God
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.040]   without any natural causes is a miracle.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.780]   The splitting of the Red Sea, a miracle.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.560]   The multiplying of the loaves and fishes, a miracle.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.760]   The healing of a lame leg instantly by Jesus or today,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.560]   a miracle.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.140]   So there are miracles that happen in the spirit
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.920]   and in the mind and in the heart,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.440]   and there are miracles that happen in the body
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.140]   and in nature.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.140]   Now, what's the purpose of God in his supernatural
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   breaking in to the natural flow of cause and effect?
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.100]   One way to answer that question
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.260]   is to cite 1 Corinthians 14, 26,
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.680]   where Paul expresses the goal, God's goal,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.060]   in all of the supernatural spiritual gifts,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060]   like healing and others.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.060]   Let all things be done for up building, or building up.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.600]   Building up, that's the goal of these miracles.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.800]   Building up means being built up in faith,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.200]   built up in hope, built up in holiness.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.360]   In other words, the aim of God's supernatural working
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.040]   in the people of God and in the world
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   is that these miracles might be faith awakening,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.680]   faith deepening, faith purifying,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   faith purifying, hope intensifying,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.180]   and love empowering, and holiness refining,
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.220]   and therefore spirit dependent,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.220]   and Christ exalting, and God glorifying.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   Those are the goals of God's miracle working in the world.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.980]   So, should we come to church in search of miracles?
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.340]   That was the question.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340]   How should I feel about that?
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.140]   Now, I suspect that what was meant in the question
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.060]   is that someone hopes that coming to church
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.540]   in the hope of seeing a physical miracle,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.340]   or a dramatic exorcism,
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.940]   or some amazing prophetic prediction,
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.760]   and there is certainly nothing wrong
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   with hoping that God would display His power in these ways.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   I would love to see God move in these ways
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.780]   in the service of His glory, and our good, and our holiness.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.180]   But there is nothing distinctly Christian,
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.180]   or Christ exalting, or holiness advancing in any of that.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.340]   Supernatural things happen by the devil,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.060]   or even by God to test His people.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.020]   I was just reading recently Deuteronomy 13, one to three,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.700]   where it says if a false prophet comes
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.380]   and predicts the future, really predicts the future,
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.060]   and tells you to follow another God,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.020]   you shouldn't follow Him.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.860]   Why?
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.580]   The Lord is testing you.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.180]   Says, "Is the Lord behind this?"
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   So that seeing the mere event of a external,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.300]   physical miracle should never be the goal of the Christian.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.940]   Never.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.060]   But if we come to worship hoping and expecting
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.340]   to see God do the miracle of new birth
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.860]   through the preaching of the Word,
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.980]   see God supernaturally convict people of sin,
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.060]   fill despairing people with hope,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.600]   the miracle of changing hatred into love,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   the miracle of having timid people made bold in the gospel,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.380]   the supernatural work of reconciliation
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.580]   when people are alienated,
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.900]   a whole congregation supernaturally made radically holy
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.000]   and humble and courageous in witness,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   then we probably are coming for the very things
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.260]   that God counts most dear in and through
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.020]   any physical miracle or not.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.260]   So that's the distinction I would want to make
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.780]   in answering the question,
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.060]   are we coming to worship with our hearts
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.060]   most intensely desirous of what God is pursuing
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.300]   in and through all His miracles,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.420]   not just the dramatic physical ones,
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   which in themselves are no sure sign of His saving presence?
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.260]   Yeah, so good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.420]   And for more details about this podcast,

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.780]   That's a lot of grace.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.600]   That is a lot of kindness from the Lord.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.940]   And as we march in that direction,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhke, and we'll see you tomorrow.
