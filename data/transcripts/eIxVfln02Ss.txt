[00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.320]   Today, we are discussing psilocybin.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.380]   Psilocybin is a psychedelic, meaning it modifies the psyche.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.120]   And in doing so, it changes our level of consciousness.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.680]   Psychedelics, such as psilocybin,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.860]   change the way that we perceive the outside world
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.400]   and our internal world, our memories, our thoughts,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.240]   our feelings, et cetera,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.560]   not just while one is under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.320]   but it can also fundamentally change
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.120]   all of those things afterwards
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.200]   and for a very long period of time afterwards as well,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.720]   which is one of the reasons why there's growing excitement
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.900]   about the application of psilocybin and other psychedelics
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.040]   for the treatment of various mental health issues,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.200]   such as depression, alcohol abuse disorder,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.580]   and addictions of various kinds,
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.260]   as well as things like OCD and eating disorders.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.880]   Today, we will discuss psilocybin, talking about what it is.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.400]   In fact, you may be surprised to learn
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.760]   that psilocybin basically is serotonin.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.280]   Now, for those of you that are familiar
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.520]   with psilocybin and serotonin,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.840]   you might think, wait, that's not true.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.440]   But in fact, psilocybin's main effect is to mimic serotonin,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720]   but it does it in a very specific way
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.760]   because it activates a subset of serotonin receptors
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.320]   in a very strong fashion,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.920]   leading to neuroplasticity
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.540]   at the level of the neural circuits,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.560]   that is the brain areas and connections
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.220]   that serve things like memory and perception.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.040]   So if any of that is confusing at this point,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.280]   I promise to make it all clear in just a few minutes.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.020]   Psilocybin is one of many psychedelics, of course.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.520]   There are things like LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.660]   Even MDMA, while not considered a classic psychedelic,
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.580]   is considered a psychedelic in the general sense.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.240]   Today's episode is going to focus
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.320]   on psilocybin in particular.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.840]   I will tell you what psilocybin is,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.140]   how it works at the molecular and cellular level.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.760]   I'll talk about how it changes brain circuitry.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.340]   I'll talk about the clinical effects,
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.120]   what's been demonstrated in controlled laboratory studies.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.400]   I'll talk about dosages and translating
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.520]   from psilocybin mushrooms to actual psilocybin,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.320]   and the compound that actually exerts
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.400]   the effects of psilocybin,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.960]   which it turns out is not psilocybin,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   but something called psilocin.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Psilocin is the actual compound that goes into the brain
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.920]   to create all the changes in consciousness
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.580]   and all the rewiring effects that we associate
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.700]   with psilocybin.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.840]   So understanding how psilocybin is converted to psilocin
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.320]   has tremendous impact on the duration
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.760]   of a psilocybin journey,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.380]   whether or not that psilocybin journey is going to lead
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.960]   to a short or longer window for neuroplasticity.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.540]   In fact, many people don't realize this,
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.760]   but much of the positive changes that are possible
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.080]   with proper, and I do want to underscore,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.760]   proper psilocybin therapeutic approaches
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.640]   takes place after the session in which one feels
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.240]   all the typical or typically associated effects
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.340]   of psilocybin, like hallucinations and changes
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920]   in thought patterns, et cetera.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.380]   So today we are going to talk a little bit about chemistry,
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.880]   but I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.440]   regardless of whether or not you have a background
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.040]   in chemistry or biology.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.660]   We're going to talk about some cell biology,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.300]   the actual neuronal changes that occur
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.120]   when one takes psilocybin.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.500]   And we're going to talk about how neural circuits
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.800]   change over time and how all of that impacts the changes
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.420]   that most people are interested in
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.120]   when they go on a psilocybin journey.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.660]   Things such as longstanding improvements in mood,
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.360]   things such as tremendous insight into themselves,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.740]   into others, into their past, their present,
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.080]   and their future, and even changes in their levels
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.740]   of creativity or their ability to experience joy from music
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.280]   or their ability to dissociate in a positive way
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.840]   from things that formerly were depressing
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.500]   or triggers for depression.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.540]   In fact, we're going to talk quite a lot
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.460]   about the conditions inside of a psilocybin journey
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.880]   that make it actually positive and therapeutic.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.420]   This is a very important point that I'll make several times
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.040]   throughout today's episode,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.080]   which is that just because something invokes neuroplasticity,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.820]   changes in brain circuitry,
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.380]   does not mean that it's therapeutic,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.500]   or I should say does not necessarily mean
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.980]   that it's therapeutic.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.220]   For neuroplasticity to be therapeutic,
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.340]   it has to be adaptive.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.900]   It has to allow someone to function better in life
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.620]   than they did previously.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.200]   So today we will talk about how the conditions
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.460]   of a psilocybin journey,
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.820]   including whether or not it's done with eyes closed
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.100]   or eyes open, or whether or not people alternate
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.280]   between eyes closed and eyes open phases of that journey,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.580]   as well as whether or not music is played
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.420]   during that journey,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.460]   and even what types of music are played,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.300]   will dictate whether or not somebody will feel better
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.460]   or worse in the days and weeks and years
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.620]   following that psilocybin journey,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.940]   as well as the dosage level,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.540]   because, as you'll soon learn as well,
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.780]   there are clinical studies showing
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.080]   that just one psilocybin journey can improve mood
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.100]   in a longstanding way,
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.840]   but most clinical trials involve two dosages,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.140]   spaced in very precise ways from one another
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.540]   with appropriate follow-up.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.620]   But in both of those particular journeys,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.180]   the structure of the journey, who's present,
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.020]   who's not present, eyes open or eyes closed,
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.620]   the particular music that's played,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.700]   all of those features make up part
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.580]   of a larger neuroplasticity trigger
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900]   of which psilocybin is critical,
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.660]   but psilocybin is not the only variable.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.860]   So whether or not you're interested
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.620]   in participating in a clinical study,
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.260]   or whether or not you're interested in psilocybin
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.600]   for other reasons,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.380]   this is critical information to understand.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.640]   So today we're going to talk about nearly every feature
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.300]   of psilocybin possible, including what psilocybin is,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.900]   how it works at the level of chemistry, cell biology
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.460]   and neural networks and neuroplasticity.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.140]   We will talk about the clinical studies,
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.640]   we'll talk about dosages,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.920]   we will talk about conditions of clinical studies,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.720]   and we will talk about the post- psilocybin journey period
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.280]   in which neuroplasticity and the various activities,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.100]   including therapy or perhaps not therapy,
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.980]   can contribute to positive therapeutic changes
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.020]   from psilocybin.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.660]   Now, as we go into this discussion,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.340]   I do want to underscore the fact
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.760]   that at the time of recording this episode,
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.500]   meaning now, May, 2023,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.820]   psilocybin is still a schedule one drug.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.500]   It is considered illegal in the United States.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.420]   There's perhaps just one exception to that,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.840]   maybe a few others,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.400]   but the main exception is in the state of Oregon.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.960]   Psilocybin has been approved
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.420]   in particular therapeutic settings
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.820]   for use in particular conditions,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.560]   namely depression and some forms of addiction.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.020]   So in Oregon, it's more or less in the domain
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.700]   of decriminalized as opposed to actually legal.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.180]   In other areas of the country,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.680]   including Oakland, California,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.840]   there are some areas in which it has been decriminalized,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.920]   and perhaps there are a few others that I'm not aware of,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.820]   but in general, psilocybin and other psychedelics
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.360]   are still considered illegal.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   And this is very important,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.760]   I'm not just saying this to protect me,
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.360]   I'm saying this to protect you,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.080]   possessing or certainly selling psilocybin,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.520]   except for rare instances such as clinical studies
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.600]   in these decriminalized areas
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.560]   that I talked about a moment ago,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.960]   is still very much not allowed under the law.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.140]   Today, I'll also discuss safety issues.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.400]   I'll talk about whether or not young people,
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.720]   meaning people 25 or younger,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   should consider psilocybin,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.200]   given that their brain is still in a rampant period
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.320]   of naturally occurring neuroplasticity.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.540]   I will also talk about dosages
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.900]   as it relates to people who have formerly been on
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.480]   or may currently be on different forms of antidepressants.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.140]   And I will talk about people who are at risk
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.640]   for psychotic episodes,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.440]   either because they know they themselves
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.040]   have a propensity for psychosis,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.240]   or they have close family members who have psychosis,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.040]   which includes things like schizophrenia,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.600]   bipolar depression,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.640]   as well as things like borderline personality
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.400]   and some related psychiatric conditions.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.960]   So today's episode really will be
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.820]   a deep dive into psilocybin.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.440]   So whether or not you think you're already familiar
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.840]   with psilocybin and its effects,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.300]   or whether or not you're just curious about them,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.320]   I do encourage, if you're willing,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.260]   to try and ratchet through some of the understanding
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.560]   of how psilocybin works and what it is,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.940]   leading up to some of the therapeutic applications
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.240]   and different patterns of dosing,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.360]   spacing of different sessions, et cetera.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.940]   'Cause I do believe that with that knowledge in hand,
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.920]   you will be able to make far better,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.700]   much more informed decisions
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.080]   about whether or not psilocybin is right for you.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.660]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.200]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.380]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.420]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.260]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.240]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.840]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.480]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.460]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.880]   physical health, and performance.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.040]   Everything goes far better when we are sleeping well
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.200]   on a consistent basis.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.000]   And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.340]   is to make sure that the temperature
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.120]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.720]   In fact, your body temperature has to drop
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.640]   by one to three degrees in order to fall asleep
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.900]   and stay deeply asleep.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.480]   And waking up involves a heating up of your body
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.320]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.560]   With Eight Sleep, you can program your mattress
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.680]   to be a specific temperature at the beginning, middle,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.760]   and towards the end of your sleep night.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.280]   Ever since I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.520]   I've slept far better than I ever have.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.080]   So it's an all around great tool
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.880]   that has tremendous functionality, not just for measuring,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   but for improving your sleep.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.000]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.360]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760]   and save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.480]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.600]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.320]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.980]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.920]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.640]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.120]   the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.920]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.620]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.480]   in order to make sure that you can see clearly
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.800]   under any conditions.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.400]   Roca understands all of that
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.880]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.220]   so that regardless of whether or not
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.960]   you're in a very brightly lit area or a more shady area,
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.280]   or you go from brightly lit to shady areas,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.600]   you can always see with tremendous clarity.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.800]   Now, even though they were initially designed for sport,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.300]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.200]   come in a tremendous number of different aesthetics.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.240]   So they have the kind of what I call cyborg versions
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.040]   that most people associate with triathlon glasses
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.520]   and sports related glasses,
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.000]   but they also have a tremendous number of frames
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.560]   that you feel perfectly comfortable wearing to work
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.200]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.460]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.000]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.500]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.380]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.920]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.240]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.280]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.800]   Now, I know most people are familiar
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.000]   or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.380]   which is essentially a very low carbohydrate diet.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.060]   It's designed to get your brain
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.760]   and body functioning off ketones,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.080]   which are a great source of fuel for the body and brain.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.560]   However, most people, including myself, are not ketogenic.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.360]   That is, I'm not in a ketosis state pretty much ever,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.480]   as far as I know.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.380]   Nonetheless, with ketone IQ,
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.000]   you can increase your blood ketones
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.020]   and thereby improve things like cognition
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.760]   and physical performance.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.600]   I find that when taking ketone IQ,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.080]   even if I'm eating a standard omnivore diet,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.560]   which is the diet that I follow,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.300]   by taking ketone IQ prior to workouts,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.860]   sometimes on an empty stomach,
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.240]   and especially prior to doing any kind of cognitive work,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.900]   so researching podcasts or doing work related to my lab
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.140]   or teaching, et cetera,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.080]   that I can maintain mental clarity
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.560]   for a longer period of time.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.320]   And it does seem to enhance my mental clarity as well.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.240]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.140]   you can go to hvmn.com
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.460]   and use the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.200]   Again, that's hvmn.com
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.860]   and use the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.180]   Let's talk about psilocybin.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.820]   And again, today we're going to focus
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.300]   specifically on psilocybin
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.780]   and we're going to set aside all the other psychedelics
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.120]   for future episodes.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.460]   Psilocybin is what's called a tryptamine.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.300]   That refers to its chemical composition,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.540]   not to the so-called psychedelic trip.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.660]   In fact, it's spelled differently.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.660]   Tryptamine is T-R-Y-P, trip, T-R-I-P, of course.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.980]   Tryptamines include psilocybin,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.340]   but also things like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.100]   The tryptamine psychedelics very closely resemble
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.300]   serotonin itself.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.020]   That's right, most of you have probably heard
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.740]   of the chemical serotonin.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.460]   And serotonin is what's called a neuromodulator,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.060]   which means your brain and body naturally make it
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.980]   and that it modifies or changes the activity
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.780]   of other neurons and neural circuits.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.780]   And it does that generally by either increasing
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.040]   or decreasing the activity of those neural circuits.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.340]   If I were to show you a picture
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.240]   of the chemical structure of psilocybin,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.880]   or its active derivative, psilocin,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.860]   and I were to also put right alongside it
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.260]   an image of the chemical structure of serotonin,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.380]   provided that you weren't a chemist who really likes
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.620]   to focus on the detailed differences between things,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.380]   you would say those look very similar.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.500]   And indeed, psilocybin and its active form, psilocin,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.680]   are very similar structurally and chemically
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.400]   to serotonin itself.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.500]   Now, as I mentioned before,
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   serotonin is something that you naturally make.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.880]   And yes, it's true that about 90% of the serotonin
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.080]   in your brain and body is manufactured in your gut.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.320]   However, contrary to popular belief,
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.460]   the serotonin in your brain is not manufactured
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.960]   from the serotonin in your gut.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.360]   You have separate independent sources of serotonin.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.540]   That is, you have particular neurons
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.360]   that make serotonin in your brain.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.020]   You also have serotonin in your gut,
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.980]   and those work more or less in parallel separately.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.440]   Now, what does serotonin do?
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.500]   This is really important to understand
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.400]   because of the similarity between psilocybin
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.680]   and its active form, psilocin, and serotonin.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.540]   Serotonin, in that it's a neuromodulator,
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.580]   changes the activity of other neurons,
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.300]   and the net effects of those changes
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.660]   are things that you're familiar with.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.620]   For instance, satiety,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.660]   or the feeling that we've had enough of various things,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.660]   such as food, or a social interaction,
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.260]   or sex, or pleasure of any kind.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.340]   Serotonin is involved in all of that,
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.260]   and an enormous number of other things,
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.280]   such as mood regulation,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.740]   such as our sense of pleasure itself, or lack of pleasure,
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.060]   such as whether or not we feel motivated or not motivated.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.540]   It works in concert with other neuromodulators,
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.060]   such as dopamine, and epinephrine, and norepinephrine.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.380]   In fact, if this were an episode about serotonin,
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.980]   which it is not,
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.700]   you would soon realize that serotonin
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.960]   is involved in so many different functions
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.180]   that impact our daily life.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   And that is one reason why
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.520]   certain antidepressant medications,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.740]   which alter, either increase or decrease,
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.860]   the amount of serotonin transmission in the brain,
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.140]   will often have a lot of side effects
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.700]   related to things like mood, libido, appetite,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.140]   sleep, et cetera.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.580]   It's because serotonin is involved
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.220]   in so many different things.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.860]   And serotonin is involved in so many different things
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.300]   because there are a lot of different
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.000]   so-called serotonin receptors.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.140]   Serotonin is a chemical that we call a ligand,
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.460]   and the chemical ligand is simply the thing
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.200]   that plugs into the receptor for that chemical or ligand.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.060]   The receptors, in this case, serotonin receptors,
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.460]   have the opportunity to do all sorts of different things.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.400]   They can change the activity of neurons,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.180]   making them more active or less active.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.220]   They can cause growth factors to be released,
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.900]   making sure that those neurons reinforce
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.040]   or even build up stronger connections
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.500]   so that they're more likely to be active in the future.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.420]   Serotonin binding to particular receptors
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.480]   can even change the gene expression in particular cells,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.180]   making those cells proliferate, so make more of them,
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.020]   making those cells more robust,
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.580]   making those cells interact with new elements
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.820]   of the brain and body.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.980]   Basically, serotonin and all these different receptors
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.720]   that it binds to has dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.560]   and maybe even thousands of different functions.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.480]   So the fact that psilocybin so closely resembles serotonin
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.120]   leads to a very important question
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.400]   that we should all be asking ourselves,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.160]   which is why is it that psilocybin,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.980]   which looks so much like serotonin,
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.680]   when one takes it in the form of magic mushrooms
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.540]   or some other form,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.540]   maybe the synthetic form of psilocybin itself,
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.940]   which nowadays is manufactured in laboratories
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.960]   and placed in different psilocybin-containing foods
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.280]   and pills, et cetera,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.020]   why that leads to complex
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.260]   yet fairly circumscribed sets of experience,
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.620]   like visual and auditory hallucinations,
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.140]   changes in particular thought patterns and neuroplasticity
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.820]   that, in many cases, in the clinical setting,
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.860]   provided things are done correctly,
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.340]   improvements in mood, relief from depression,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.880]   relief from various compulsive disorders, et cetera, right?
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.340]   This is really what you need to understand
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.300]   if you want to understand psilocybin and how it works
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.500]   and how to make it work optimally
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.700]   for a given condition or goal.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.860]   You have to understand what it's actually doing
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.260]   and what allows psilocybin to do fairly specific things
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.740]   in comparison to serotonin,
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.700]   even though psilocybin and serotonin are so similar,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.740]   is that psilocybin mainly binds to
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.140]   and activates the so-called serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.380]   The serotonin 2A receptor is one of, again,
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.420]   many different serotonin receptors,
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.980]   but serotonin 2A is expressed
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.140]   in particular areas of the brain
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.860]   and even on particular areas of neurons in the brain
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.940]   that allow for very specific types of changes
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.940]   in neural circuitry to take place,
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.740]   not just when one is under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.540]   but afterwards as well.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.660]   So really, in order to have a useful discussion
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.140]   about psilocybin, we need to talk a lot
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.340]   about the serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.060]   but fortunately for you,
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.220]   unless you're somebody really interested
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.340]   in structural biology or cell biology,
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.580]   that discussion is not going to be about the binding pocket
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.220]   for serotonin on serotonin 2A receptor
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.800]   or a lot of the downstream signaling
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.140]   of the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.900]   We'll talk a little bit about that where it's relevant,
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.680]   but more importantly, at least for sake of today's discussion
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.900]   we're going to talk about how the serotonin 2A receptor
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.580]   is really the one responsible
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.540]   for triggering all the changes in neural circuitry
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.580]   that lead to the changes, that is the improvements in mood,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.780]   the relief from compulsive disorders in many case,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.180]   but really it's the serotonin 2A receptor selectivity
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.940]   of psilocybin that is leading to all the excitement
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.820]   that you hear about in terms of psilocybin
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.220]   as a therapeutic tool.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.180]   Let me say that from a slightly different angle.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.900]   There are data that I'll talk about today,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.600]   which show that one, although in most cases,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.140]   two psilocybin journeys done with particular dosages
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.380]   of psilocybin lead to maximal binding or occupancy
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.180]   of those serotonin 2A receptors in ways that lead
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.940]   to significant and unprecedented relief
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.240]   for major depression.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.180]   In fact, you'll soon learn that the clinical trials
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.380]   for psilocybin are outperforming standard therapy
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.340]   and outperforming so-called SSRIs
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.200]   and various other antidepressants
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.340]   in terms of providing depression relief
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.340]   in ways that are frankly staggering, not just to me,
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.220]   but to the psychiatric community at large.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.220]   And this is where so much of the excitement is coming from.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.760]   Now that statement could be taken one way,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.660]   which is to just say, okay, well,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.060]   here's a compound psilocybin that outperforms SSRIs
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.160]   and therefore all the attention should be on psilocybin.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   But SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.060]   In other words, the SSRIs of which there's now a lot
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.100]   of controversy, things like Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.580]   I'm sure you've heard some of this controversy.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.740]   There are people who are very pro-SSRIs,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.620]   although there are a growing number of people
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.460]   who really feel that the SSRIs are probably most appropriate
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.660]   for things like obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.800]   where they in fact can be very beneficial.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.660]   But there's a lot of kind of leaning back from SSRIs
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.480]   as the be all end all for the treatment of depression
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.200]   nowadays because of the side effect profiles.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.220]   And the fact that it's not even really clear
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.740]   that serotonin deficiencies are the major cause
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.020]   of depression in the first place.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.940]   Now, again, we're talking about psilocybin,
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.960]   not about SSRIs, but you should be thinking,
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.320]   wait, how is it that two molecules,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.860]   psilocybin and some particular SSRI,
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.440]   both of which look like
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.200]   and or increase serotonin transmission in the brain
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.780]   are leading to either incredibly positive
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.100]   and interesting outcomes
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.660]   or to kind of troubling side effect riddled outcomes.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.320]   And again, it all boils back down to the selectivity
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.920]   of psilocybin to bind that serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.380]   And so in order to understand how psilocybin works
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.600]   and in order to understand proper dosing profiles
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.880]   and spacing of sessions, AKA journeys,
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.400]   we really need to talk a little bit more
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.760]   about the serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.600]   where it is in the brain,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.280]   what sorts of things happen
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.640]   when psilocybin binds the serotonin 2A receptor
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.300]   and how those things set in motion the various changes,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.380]   the neuroplasticity that allows people to feel better
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.460]   in terms of their mood.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.040]   And as you'll soon learn, can experience more pleasure
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.380]   and joy from things like music and enhanced creativity.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.120]   All the things that I do believe,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.040]   whether or not people are thinking about
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.960]   or maybe even exploring psilocybin
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.900]   for recreational or therapeutic purposes,
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.720]   all the things that people want
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.400]   and are really talking about
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   and perhaps even doing psilocybin in order to obtain.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.480]   So before going any further,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.880]   I just want to place an image in your mind.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.220]   You can place an image in your mind
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.660]   whereby when serotonin is released in the brain naturally,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.720]   not having taken any compound, any drug, anything,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.120]   it's getting released at a lot of different sites,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.640]   binding to a lot of different serotonin receptors,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.200]   doing a lot of different things.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.280]   When somebody takes an SSRI,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.480]   the net effect of that selective serotonin
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.660]   reuptake inhibitor is that there's more serotonin around
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.720]   to exert its effects because it's a reuptake inhibitor
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   at the synapse, the connections between neurons,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.780]   the serotonin can do its thing more extensively
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.320]   and for longer periods of time,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.920]   but it's doing it kind of non-specifically.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.480]   So when you think about standard antidepressant treatments,
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.280]   at least for sake of this discussion,
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.260]   you kind of think of a sprinkling or a kind of, you know,
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.040]   spraying of serotonin at different locations in the brain
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.640]   and binding to lots of different receptors.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.740]   Whereas when you think about psilocybin,
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.000]   even though the subjective effects are pretty diverse,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.220]   we'll talk about those in a few moments,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.360]   what you're really talking about is a molecule, psilocybin,
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.240]   that looks a lot like serotonin that is selectively
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.540]   and very strongly binding to and activating
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.120]   that serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.520]   So that's the image I'd like you to embed in your mind.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.240]   And then the next image I'd like you to embed in your mind
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.280]   is where these serotonin 2A receptors
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.700]   are located in the brain.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.280]   The serotonin 2A receptors are located
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.920]   in multiple brain regions,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.080]   but they have a tremendous amount of expression
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.600]   in the so-called neocortex,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.960]   the outside of the brain that includes things
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.120]   like our prefrontal cortex,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.880]   which is involved in understanding context, right?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.040]   Which behaviors, thoughts, and speech patterns
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.520]   are appropriate for certain circumstances,
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.280]   how to switch context and category switch
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.640]   when you go from, you know, playing sports
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.480]   to hanging out with friends,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.440]   to being in a professional setting,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.420]   you change your behavior and the way that you speak,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.000]   and perhaps even the way that you think.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.200]   You might think some things that are out of context,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.880]   but you probably keep those to yourself,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.600]   and your ability to keep those to yourself
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.160]   are dependent on a functional prefrontal cortex.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.400]   There are a lot of 5-HT-2A,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.040]   and by the way, 5-HT is the abbreviation for serotonin,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.980]   so there are a lot of serotonin 2A receptors
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.360]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.580]   Also in other areas of the cortex
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.720]   that are associated with sensation and perception,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.740]   that is hearing of sounds,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.580]   that is seeing of particular things,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.460]   and in particular, there is a very, very, very
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.100]   high expression of serotonin 2A receptors
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.320]   in the visual cortex,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.580]   and that is one of the reasons why psilocybin
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.940]   triggers visual hallucinations,
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.980]   and provided psilocybin is present
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.160]   at sufficient enough concentration
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.060]   that is taken at a sufficient dosage,
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.920]   one will experience profound visual hallucinations
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.060]   regardless of whether or not their eyes are open
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.140]   or their eyes are closed.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.280]   Now, that's an important fact
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.860]   because it explains one of the major effects of psilocybin
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.320]   that people experience while they are on the drug.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.780]   Now, as I'll talk about a little bit later
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.920]   in terms of what constitutes a useful psilocybin session,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.760]   useful meaning that it's leading
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.300]   to adaptive improvements in mood,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.080]   adaptive improvements in creativity and cognition, et cetera,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.120]   is that people not have their eyes open
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.720]   for at least the majority of the psilocybin session.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.360]   This is something I've discussed with several experts
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.780]   who are running clinical studies
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.480]   on psilocybin in their laboratories,
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.640]   some of whom are going to be guests
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.600]   on the Huberman Lab podcast in upcoming episodes,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.780]   and I can't underscore this enough.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.420]   Because your visual cortex contains so many
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.380]   of these serotonin 2A receptors,
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.800]   and because psilocybin binds so strongly
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.280]   to that serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.760]   you're going to experience a lot of visual hallucinations
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   when you are under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.720]   There's no surprise there.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.660]   This has been known for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.760]   It's one of the main reasons why people take psilocybin.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.120]   However, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.780]   these hallucinations occur even when the eyes are closed,
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.580]   and it's now fairly well established
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.640]   that if people are to take psilocybin
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.640]   and have their eyes open,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   much of their cognition, much of their thinking,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.360]   much of the time spent in that psilocybin journey
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.040]   is focused on the altered perceptions of things
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.580]   in the outside environment.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.360]   Sometimes this looks like a sort of a fracturing
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.520]   of the outside world into kind of geometric shapes.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.100]   Sometimes it appears as a kind of melting of things
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.880]   in the visual environment, including people's faces
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.080]   or a morphing of people's faces.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.540]   All of that has a strong, let's just call it a draw
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.780]   for a lot of people who are looking
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.720]   for a highly unusual experience
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.760]   inside of the psilocybin journey.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.900]   But I think if one's goal is to derive
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.540]   the long lasting benefit from the psilocybin experience,
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.680]   it's very clear that having an eye mask
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.960]   or some other eye covering or something that ensures
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.200]   that one's eyes are closed for the majority,
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.080]   if not the entire psilocybin session
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.880]   is going to be very useful
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.520]   because it's going to limit the extent
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.360]   to which one is focused on those outside changes
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   in visual perception, AK hallucinations,
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.040]   and rather will allow the person to go inward
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.920]   to combine whatever it is that they happen to be seeing
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.740]   in their mind's eye with the different thoughts
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.600]   and memories and changes in their emotions
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   that are occurring.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.140]   And that going inward by staying in the eye mask,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.560]   at least for the majority of the time,
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.640]   seems to be a very, if not the critical feature
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.200]   of making the psilocybin journey effective
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.680]   in the therapeutic sense.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.960]   Now, once again, I want to cue
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.120]   to some of the safety precautions here.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.560]   I'm going to say this at least three times
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.280]   throughout today's episode.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.200]   As I'm talking now and various other times
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.040]   throughout today's episode,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.800]   you may get the impression that I'm all for everybody
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.040]   doing psilocybin, and that is simply not the case.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.480]   In order for a psilocybin journey
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.660]   to be therapeutically useful,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.280]   it does require certain conditions and supports,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.160]   and there are certain people for which psilocybin use
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.640]   is going to be contraindicated,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.600]   meaning they should not do psilocybin.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.060]   In particular, people who have existing
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.480]   or have a predisposition to psychotic episodes
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.860]   or bipolar episodes.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.880]   Even having a first relative who has bipolar
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.120]   or schizophrenic or schizotypal issues
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.400]   can be a rule out condition.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.000]   That is, can get someone eliminated
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.620]   from a clinical study on psilocybin
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.040]   for fear of triggering psychotic episodes,
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.820]   not just during the psilocybin journey,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.260]   but potentially in a longstanding way.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.520]   So again, that's really critical.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.960]   The other thing is that everything I'm talking about today,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.360]   unless I say otherwise, is really focused on adults,
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.960]   meaning people who are 25 years old or older,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   that is their basic wiring and rewiring of the brain
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   that we call developmental neuroplasticity is completed.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.880]   Most of the studies today that I'll talk about
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.100]   involve subjects ranging from 25 years of age
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.360]   out to about 70 years of age, but no one younger.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.040]   So again, psilocybin and its use
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.760]   is certainly not for everybody.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   It's still illegal.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.280]   It's being used in the clinical setting and research setting.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.600]   There are these pockets of decriminalized areas
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.960]   and potentially soon legalization of psilocybin,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.360]   but again, only in the proper clinical setting, okay?
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.340]   Again, I say that not just to protect myself,
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.440]   but I say that also to protect all of you.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.160]   Psilocybin is a powerful, powerful drug,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.060]   not just to be under the influence of,
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.760]   but also in terms of its longstanding changes
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.960]   after the effects of psilocybin have worn off.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.480]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.380]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.840]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.200]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.100]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.800]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.000]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.600]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.680]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.660]   once or usually twice a day
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.280]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.360]   Our gut is very important.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.920]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.680]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.080]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.720]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.560]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.400]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.960]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.880]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.760]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.220]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.080]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.040]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.360]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.640]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.920]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.340]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.020]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.400]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.240]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.840]   Let's talk a little bit about dosing of psilocybin
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.880]   and also about microdosing of psilocybin.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.100]   Now, this is an area that I wouldn't say is controversial,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.740]   but that there's, how should we say this?
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.620]   There's a lot of loose thinking around this
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.740]   in the non-clinical, non-research communities.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.560]   But within the clinical and research communities,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.760]   there's a lot of data that's come out
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.980]   indicating what effective and safe doses,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.420]   provided all other things are considered safe,
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.460]   safe doses of psilocybin actually are.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.680]   And here, we really can go back to our discussion
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.400]   of psilocybin as "magic mushrooms" or mushrooms.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.460]   And if one were to translate
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.300]   from the mushroom form of psilocybin
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.900]   to the psilocybin that's actually used in various studies,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.820]   because frankly, in these studies,
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.040]   people aren't eating mushrooms.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   They're typically taking synthetic psilocybin,
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.160]   either intravenously, injected into a vein, or orally.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.920]   And that's how the researchers are able
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.940]   to tightly control the amount of psilocybin.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.520]   And the typical dosage that's used in clinical studies
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.300]   ranges from one milligram,
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.940]   often given repeatedly from day to day
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.640]   over long periods of time, so-called microdosing,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.420]   and really that one milligram per day,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.220]   or even up to three milligrams per day,
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.080]   repeatedly over time is what people
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.540]   generally think of as microdosing,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.140]   as compared to, say, a 10-milligram dose given once,
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.320]   maybe twice in two separate sessions,
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   or a 25 to 30-milligram dosage that's given once or twice.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.640]   Now, those amounts of one to three milligrams,
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.440]   or 10 milligrams, or 25 to 30 milligrams
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.520]   might not mean much to those of you
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.020]   that don't think about these things in the research terms.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.100]   Perhaps you've heard of microdosing,
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.940]   and you've also heard of macro or "heroic" dosing, okay?
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.000]   That's sort of a common,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.460]   or I should say, popular nomenclature for psychedelics.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.400]   And I'll circle back to that in a few minutes.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.220]   But I think one of the questions that I hear a lot
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.440]   is how much psilocybin is present
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.680]   in a given amount of mushrooms.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.740]   And so the way this typically works is that mushrooms
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.200]   are often discussed in terms of grams or ounces,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.680]   so an eighth of mushrooms
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.260]   refers to an eighth of an ounce of mushrooms,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.220]   or X number of grams of mushrooms.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.420]   The breakdown is actually quite simple.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.500]   1,000 milligrams equals one gram.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.940]   And the concentration of psilocybin
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.760]   in most so-called magic mushrooms is about 1%.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.100]   So one gram of mushrooms being 1,000 milligrams
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.440]   means that it contains approximately,
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.980]   and again, it's approximately 10 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.000]   And in most of the clinical studies,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.640]   it's been shown that the dosage of 25 to 30 milligrams
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.660]   given, or I should say, taken once or twice,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.600]   we'll talk about the spacing of sessions a little bit later,
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.640]   taken once or twice is what's leading
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.600]   to the most pronounced therapeutic outcomes.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   But of course, with enhanced therapeutic outcomes,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.520]   one also observes enhanced side effect profiles,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.640]   or what are called adverse events.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.460]   So there's an important nuanced conversation
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.320]   that has to take place.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.380]   But right now we're talking about the conversion
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.360]   of grams of mushrooms to psilocybin.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   So one gram of mushrooms being 1,000 milligrams
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.440]   containing 1% psilocybin
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.700]   means that it contains 10 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.580]   Now, the so-called heroic doses that you've heard about,
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.360]   and this is something that's discussed more with the,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.080]   let's call them traditional or classic psychonauts.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.320]   These are people that may have an advanced degree,
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.840]   but typically are not running laboratories
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.560]   exploring the effects of psilocybin
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.260]   in controlled clinical trials.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.700]   These are people who have been longtime explorers
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.920]   and often writers and people who have been spokespeople
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.160]   for psilocybin and other psychedelics.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.060]   And they will often refer to the so-called heroic doses.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.680]   It's a little bit hard to translate
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.980]   from that informal community to the scientific data,
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.880]   but in discussing that topic with various researchers
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   who run laboratories at major universities
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.300]   focused on psychedelic therapies,
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.500]   what I was told is that the quote unquote heroic dose
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   that's often discussed really refers to a five gram or so
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.640]   dose of mushrooms.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   So what that translates to is 50 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.520]   So when you hear someone talk about a quote unquote
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.720]   heroic dose, they're probably referring to ingestion
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.860]   of 50 milligrams or so of psilocybin,
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.980]   but in its mushroom form.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.380]   So about five grams of mushrooms.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.880]   And again, it's important to point out
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.800]   that the concentration of psilocybin
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.680]   in different strains of mushrooms and in different batches,
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.400]   and depending on the age of those mushrooms
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.440]   and how they've been stored, et cetera,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.840]   can vary tremendously from batch to batch.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.080]   In fact, there are some laboratories
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   that have explored the range of psilocybin concentration
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.540]   in different mushroom strains
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.580]   and different so-called magic mushrooms.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.200]   And that range is pretty broad.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   It's anywhere from a half percent all the way up to 2%.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.420]   What that means is that someone might get a hold
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.260]   of one gram of mushrooms,
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.040]   thinking that they're taking 10 milligrams of psilocybin
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.640]   in those mushrooms when in fact they're actually taking 20.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.420]   Or somebody could take three grams of mushrooms
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.560]   thinking they're taking 30 grams of psilocybin.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.720]   And in fact, they're only taking 10
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.300]   or 15 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.340]   So the sourcing is really key.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.280]   Obviously, as things become more legal and more regulated
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.660]   and more used in the therapeutic setting,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.840]   or, and this is what's happening more and more,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.340]   or as people start to rely on synthetically made psilocybin
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.860]   as opposed to using mushrooms to ingest psilocybin,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.220]   then certainly the dosaging is going to be more consistent
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.740]   from batch to batch because we're not talking
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.660]   about batches of mushrooms.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.340]   We're talking about batches of psilocybin itself.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.060]   So now I'd like to take a step back
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.300]   from all this chemistry and cell biology
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.140]   and talk a little bit about the structure
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.500]   of a psilocybin journey itself
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.120]   and relate that to what we now know
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.860]   about what's happening in the brain
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.540]   during the psilocybin journey.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.380]   And then a little bit later,
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.180]   we will return to that serotonin 2A receptor
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.340]   when we talk about some of the more lasting changes
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.200]   in brain chemistry and brain wiring
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.060]   that occur after the psilocybin journey is over.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.600]   So let's take a couple of minutes
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.900]   and just discuss the various components
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.740]   of an effective therapeutic psilocybin journey.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.320]   And here I'm not detailing a menu of things
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.580]   that people should do in order to pretend
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.180]   that they are a psilocybin assisted therapy coach
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.940]   or to do self-administered psilocybin therapy.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.180]   That is not what I'm doing.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.900]   What I am trying to do is to share with you
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.660]   the consistent components that are present
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.720]   in the clinical trials that have demonstrated
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.380]   the effectiveness of psilocybin
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.540]   for the treatment of depression
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.180]   and for other compulsive and addictive disorders.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.180]   And those data, meaning the specific data
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.420]   related to those trials and the references themselves,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.020]   we'll get into a little bit later.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.340]   But we can't really have a conversation
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.200]   about psilocybin and what it does
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.660]   without talking about the so-called set and setting,
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.520]   as it's often referred to,
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.360]   that is known to at least bias the probability
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.640]   of the journey being beneficial
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.560]   and not a so-called bad trip.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.080]   So what are the variables that make up
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.900]   an effective and safe psilocybin journey?
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.920]   And again, when we say safe,
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.560]   we're referring to people who are not prone
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.000]   to psychotic episodes.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.680]   They don't even have a first relative
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.300]   that's prone to psychotic episodes.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.520]   We're talking about people that are 25 years or older.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.820]   We're talking about people that, for instance,
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.940]   are not taking antidepressants
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.400]   that impact the serotonin system.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.920]   This is very important to understand.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.900]   I think a lot of people don't know this,
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.500]   but as far as I know,
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.460]   all of the studies that have explored psilocybin
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.300]   for its ability to positively impact brain chemistry
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.060]   and mood and function have required
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.980]   that people either not be on or abstain
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.500]   from antidepressants in the weeks
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.260]   leading up to the psilocybin journey.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.260]   Now, that is not to say
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.060]   that if you are currently taking SSRIs
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.980]   or something similar that you should cease taking them
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.820]   and do psilocybin.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.160]   I'm absolutely not saying that.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.660]   That could be very, very, very dangerous,
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.140]   if not catastrophic.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.500]   Anytime you're going to take anything
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.460]   or stop taking anything for that matter,
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.580]   you do need to consult with your physician,
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.720]   in this case, a psychiatrist as well.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.660]   So let's talk about psilocybin journeys
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.340]   from the subjective side and from the structural side.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.040]   And when I say the structural side,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.700]   what I mean is what does a psychedelic journey
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.880]   actually include?
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.500]   And here are the words set and setting
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.840]   become extremely important.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.580]   Some of you may have heard that set and setting
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.860]   are the foundation of a well done
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.740]   or even therapeutically beneficial psychedelic journey.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.940]   And all of that really hinges on safety and outcomes.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.600]   So set refers to mindset,
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.100]   the mindset of the person taking the psychedelic
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.860]   and setting refers to, as the name suggests,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.240]   the setting in which they're taking it in
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.220]   and the people that are present there.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.100]   So let's talk about setting first.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.140]   The setting for a psychedelic journey
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.300]   needs to be one in which the person under the influence
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.280]   of the psilocybin or other psychedelic is safe.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.060]   That means no windows they can jump out of,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.900]   that means no streets of moving cars they can run out into,
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.600]   that means no opportunity for getting lost,
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.760]   that means no opportunity for getting into bodies of water.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.540]   In other words, it requires that there be at least one
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.440]   and perhaps even two or more other individuals
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.260]   who are not also taking psychedelics, right?
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.520]   Who are not also taking psychedelics,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.600]   present in that setting to ensure
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.720]   that the person taking the psilocybin
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.180]   is not going to harm themselves or others.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.260]   I say this not to sound like a school teacher,
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.980]   even though technically I'm a school teacher,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.860]   but because of course I don't want anyone to get harmed.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.920]   And I'm also aware that there's a lot of interest nowadays
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.540]   in psychedelics such as psilocybin becoming legal
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.900]   or decriminalized for their therapeutic applications.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.500]   And if we look back to the late 1960s and early 1970s
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.040]   when the Controlled Substances Act was invoked
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.000]   to make psychedelics like psilocybin illegal,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.960]   one of the bases for that
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.160]   was not just the geopolitical unrest at the time
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.540]   and things like the Vietnam War,
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.600]   but also some highlighted instances
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.840]   in which people did not take set
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.100]   and setting into consideration,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.400]   took things like LSD, stared at the sun, went blind,
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.220]   or took psilocybin, went out and harmed somebody else.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.120]   Again, these are very, very isolated instances,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.280]   but these are the exact sort of instances
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.500]   that lead to criminalization
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.040]   or the fact that things like psilocybin and LSD
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.840]   and MDMA for that matter are considered illegal.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.500]   Again, I completely acknowledge
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.180]   that there are a number of different factors
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.040]   making them illegal.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.500]   We could have a whole discussion about that.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.580]   We talked about the drug trade, the war on drugs,
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.660]   but right now is such a critical time in the history
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.100]   and the use of psychedelics
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.300]   for therapeutic and other reasons.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.820]   And getting setting correct,
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.440]   meaning making it absolutely as safe as possible
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.900]   for the person taking the psychedelic is absolutely key.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.720]   And one of the best ways to ensure that it's safe
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.580]   is to have responsible individuals
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.500]   who are not under the influence of psychedelics
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.980]   present in that environment.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.420]   So that's one component of setting.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.820]   The other component of setting that we talked about earlier,
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.500]   which turns out to be very important,
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.020]   is the opportunity and perhaps even the bias
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.220]   toward the person on the psychedelic being seated
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.740]   or ideally lying down and being in the eye mask
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.600]   or at least having their eyes covered
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.060]   so that they can combine
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.180]   any spontaneous visual hallucinations that occur
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.700]   with the various thought processes that are occurring
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.360]   while under the influence of psychedelics.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.140]   This is far and away different than quote unquote,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.760]   taking mushrooms and going into the woods
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.020]   or taking mushrooms and going to the beach.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.220]   What we're talking about today
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.980]   is the use of psychedelics
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.780]   for particular brain rewiring outcomes
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.060]   that yes, can involve things
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.260]   like changing one's relationship to nature
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.460]   or changing one's relationship to somebody else
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.380]   by interacting with nature or somebody else.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.300]   And while I'm not trying to diminish the potential value
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.380]   of those sorts of psychedelic journeys,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.220]   if we look at the scientific data,
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.700]   the vast majority of it,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.020]   not just in the clinical setting,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.900]   but in terms of understanding the safety and efficacy
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.860]   and positive rewiring of brain circuitry
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.360]   that allows people to feel better,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.740]   to understand themselves better
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.500]   and to interact with life in more adaptive ways
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.740]   going forward out of the psychedelic journey
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.100]   involve these very, let's say, you know,
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.420]   subdued settings that are typically in one room,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.140]   a closed environment with one or two other individuals
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.280]   acting as sort of guides or helping the individual
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.120]   by talking to them from time to time
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.580]   if they feel like they have to sort through
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.800]   a particular aspect of the psychedelic journey
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.920]   that's creating anxiety.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.980]   And we'll talk about the contour of the psychedelic journey
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.420]   that almost everyone who takes psilocybin
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.600]   at somewhere between 20 and 30 milligram dosages
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.940]   tends to experience.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.080]   But the setting that I'm describing
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.260]   is not just a list of things to, you know,
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.100]   make sure you're safe,
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.840]   but they're really the list of things that also ensure
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.120]   that one can get the maximum benefit
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.080]   out of the psilocybin journey.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.900]   Now, other things included in setting that are known,
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.880]   again, from scientific literature to be very influential
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.860]   in terms of the experience that one has
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.260]   and to bias things towards a positive experience
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.280]   are, again, safety, eye mask,
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.900]   but also the presence of music.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.380]   Now, when I first heard about this
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.780]   from one of the premier researchers
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.460]   on psilocybin and other psychedelics,
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.700]   which is Robin Cardart-Harris,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.780]   he's a professor at University of California, San Francisco,
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.580]   who's one of the major pioneers
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.100]   in the studies of psychedelics.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.100]   And when he first started telling you
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.240]   about the critical role that music plays,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.940]   I thought, okay, that makes sense.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.880]   You know, music can impact our emotion,
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.520]   impact the way that we think
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   and could therefore impact what one experiences
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.360]   during the psychedelic journey.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.300]   But he really underscored for me
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.820]   the extent to which music is not just
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.680]   a sort of incidental feature of the setting
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.420]   in psychedelic set and setting,
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:41.860]   but that it is one of the major drivers
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.240]   of the actual cognitive and emotional experience
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.080]   that somebody has on something like psilocybin
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.000]   that allows the psilocybin journey
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.760]   to be looked at or viewed not just as beneficial,
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.140]   but, and this is quoted in the scientific literature,
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.540]   as one of the most profound and important
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   positive experiences that one ever experienced
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.740]   in their life.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.120]   So let's talk about the sorts of music
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.280]   that have been used in these clinical studies.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.780]   Well, first of all, we need to think about
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.200]   how long the psilocybin journey itself is going to be.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.500]   And the typical duration of the psilocybin journey
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.980]   is anywhere from four to six hours.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   It's going to depend somewhat on dose.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.380]   It's going to depend somewhat on variability
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.340]   in people's liver metabolism.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.380]   And it's also going to depend somewhat
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.940]   on how much food people have in their gut.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.780]   In all the clinical studies that I read,
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:37.140]   it was advised that people not have any food in their gut
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.060]   at the time at which they ingest
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.340]   or injected with the psilocybin.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.340]   It's particularly true if people
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.340]   are going to be taking psilocybin mushrooms
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.860]   in order to get their psilocybin.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.180]   And that has been done in a few studies.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.180]   Most studies, however, use synthetic psilocybin
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.740]   taken orally.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.980]   Again, that's converted to psilocin in the gut
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.260]   by the acidity of the gut.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.620]   And the acidity of the gut is going to be impacted
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.980]   by the various foods that people eat.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.800]   And so that's one of the major reasons
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.380]   why people are advised to not eat for at least four hours
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.500]   prior to the psilocybin journey.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.820]   So here we've got this six hour, what we're calling journey,
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.520]   'cause that's what everyone calls it, or trip,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.340]   that people start experiencing about 30 to 45 minutes
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.140]   after ingesting psilocybin or taking psilocybin.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.900]   There's a peak component
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.340]   in which there's a maximal intensity of emotion
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.540]   and often that's also associated with anxiety.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.720]   And this is very important to understand.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.700]   The anxiety component is part of what,
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.740]   in the therapeutic setting,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.980]   they refer to as ego dissolution.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.720]   And that anxiety around the peak,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.880]   and I think most people would probably hear peak experience
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.220]   and think, oh, we're talking about
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.580]   a peak positive experience.
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:51.580]   But no, we're referring to a peak experience and anxiety
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.760]   that people stay with and then come down from gradually
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.780]   as one goes from the second or third hour
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.300]   after taking psilocybin.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.840]   And that tapers off slowly toward the six hour mark,
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.680]   what sometimes people refer to as parachuting back in.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.560]   Of course, they're not, hopefully,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.620]   I would very much hope people aren't actually
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.660]   parachuting back in while on psilocybin,
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.300]   but I think you get the idea.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.260]   The music that's typically played in the clinical studies
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.760]   using psilocybin for the treatment of depression
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.520]   or for compulsive disorders or addiction
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.960]   tends to have a particular contour that matches with
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:35.660]   and can also drive that contour of the psilocybin journey
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.040]   that I just described.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.140]   Again, we're talking about people wearing an eye mask
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.600]   with guides present.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.940]   So people who are not taking psilocybin there as well
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.320]   to ensure that the person feels supported and is safe.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.680]   The person is typically lying down, sometimes sitting down,
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.240]   but more often than not lying down, wearing an eye mask.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.520]   And the music that's played at the beginning
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.540]   of the psilocybin session tends to be music
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.040]   that doesn't have a lot of vocalizations.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.920]   It tends to be things like classical music.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.020]   It tends to be fairly low volume,
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.200]   but that then transitions into music
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.420]   that has a lot of percussion.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.420]   So often drums that tends to be higher volume
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.460]   that has a lot of intensity at about the time
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.140]   that one would be experiencing the peak in emotion
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.080]   and in perception, the so-called peak of the journey.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.400]   That intense music tends to be played
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.780]   for about 45 minutes to 90 minutes,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.940]   depending on the study one looks at.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.740]   And then tends to transition into softer music again,
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.880]   sometimes choral type or more melodic music,
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.060]   often female voices in particular,
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.180]   and then transition into nature sounds and things
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.820]   that more or less mimic the outside natural world
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.160]   and less so synthetic things like drums or instruments
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.200]   and vocalizations and things of that sort.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.360]   So why would it be so important that music match
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.180]   and even contribute to the subjective experience
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.620]   that people have on psychedelics?
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.020]   And here we should probably take a couple of moments
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.580]   and just talk about what those subjective experiences
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.420]   are like.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.880]   So for people that haven't done psilocybin
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.500]   or any psychedelics, it's a little hard to describe,
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.280]   but one way to describe it is that there's a lot
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.100]   of so-called perceptual blending.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.440]   So for instance, people in the eye mask will report seeing
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.780]   some geometric shapes and colors,
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   but perhaps the music they're listening to
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.800]   will then start to change the intensity or the movement
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.440]   of whatever it is that they're seeing, hallucinating,
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.100]   inside of the eye mask in ways that are linked.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.940]   This is referred to as synesthesia or the merging
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.180]   of different senses that are not ordinarily merged.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.840]   In addition, people under the influence of psilocybin
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.900]   or other psychedelics for that matter,
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.780]   often will report that their pattern of breathing
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.960]   becomes linked to the perceptions of things
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.480]   that they are hearing or seeing or feeling.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.020]   So for instance, if they take a big deep breath in
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.540]   and then a long exhale out,
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.240]   they may find that during the long exhale out,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.260]   that the notes of music that they're hearing
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.140]   in those moments are also drawn out
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.260]   for the duration of the breath and they'll inhale
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.300]   and that they're getting at least what they perceive
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.540]   as control over the music,
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.500]   which of course they are not actually controlling
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.020]   by using their breath.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.220]   And that perhaps their visual perceptions
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.820]   are also being merged with that.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.580]   So those are just a couple of examples
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.840]   of how perceptual blending, AKA synesthesia,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.480]   can occur while under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.760]   And this really is highly individual
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.180]   from one person to the next.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.080]   Some people, for instance,
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.580]   will find that if they take their fingertips
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.440]   and rub them across the couch or the chair
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.640]   that they happen to be lying down or sitting on,
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.760]   that they will experience a change in the music.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.920]   Maybe even if they move their hand up,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.640]   they hear an increase in frequency of sound,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.520]   they move their hand down,
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.080]   they hear a decrease in frequency of sound,
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   then all of this is linked to their emotional state
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.800]   at the same time and vice versa.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.560]   Okay, so we're talking about a lot of perceptual
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.780]   and emotional blending and some sense of control
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.560]   over one's perceptions and emotions
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.340]   in a way that's very unordinary, even extraordinary.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.480]   Now, we can step back from all of this
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.020]   very subjective description of the psychedelic journey
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.300]   and ask what is going on
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.860]   that would allow these sorts of things to occur?
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.120]   And there you are already equipped with an understanding
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.700]   of the cell biology and the chemistry
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.420]   that makes all of this possible.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.060]   And that is that when psilocybin is ingested
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.620]   and then converted to psilocin,
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.180]   that's the psilocin that crosses the blood brain barrier,
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.260]   and then even though psilocin looks a lot like serotonin,
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.060]   psilocin has this incredible ability
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.920]   to predominantly activate the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.600]   Well, we can understand much of what's happening
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.220]   at a subjective level during the psychedelic journey,
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.120]   even right down to the sorts of emotions
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.440]   and perceptual blending, the synesthesia,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.020]   we can understand a lot of that
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.140]   by understanding where the serotonin 2A receptors
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.140]   are expressed on neurons
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.780]   and what those particular neurons are doing.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.260]   And the simplest way to describe this
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.540]   is that there's a category of neurons
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.900]   that we call pyramidal neurons.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.500]   Pyramidal neurons are found lots of places in the brain,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.700]   but they're called pyramidal neurons
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.580]   'cause they're shaped like a pyramid.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.480]   They have a cell body, which is the part of the cell
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.420]   that has the DNA in it and a lot of other important things
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.280]   like the organelles, mitochondria, et cetera.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   And then they also have what are called dendrites.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.440]   Dendrites are the little branches or processes
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.680]   that reach out both from the bottom of these cells,
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.800]   and then these pyramidal cells are interesting
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.100]   because they also grow a branch up, up, up, up, up
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.440]   into layers of neural tissue above them,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.120]   and they have what's called an apical branch.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.380]   That's the part that grows up.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.460]   And then they fan out at the top.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.880]   And that fanning out at the top allows them to communicate
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.820]   with other neurons in their environment, okay?
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.780]   So if you're not getting a good picture of this in your mind
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.540]   from my description, I apologize,
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:57.980]   but simply think about putting your arms out to the side.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.400]   And by doing that, you're able to interact with things
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.900]   that are some distance from your body.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.500]   It's sort of an obvious thing in that case.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.640]   These cells are effectively doing the same thing
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.420]   by extending little processes out
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.260]   into layers above them and to the sides.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.380]   And this is really important
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.020]   because much of the serotonin 2A receptors
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.720]   that are present on neurons in the brain
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.180]   are present in those apical dendrites,
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.940]   those branches of these pyramidal neurons that are above
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.380]   and that extend out to the side of those neurons.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.860]   And so when somebody is under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:35.060]   that means that psilocin has bound to the receptors
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.620]   on those apical dendrites,
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.340]   and it's increasing lateral communication
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.860]   across brain areas.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.220]   In fact, this is perhaps one of the most well-documented
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.200]   effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics,
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.140]   which is that there's a shift from the brain
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.480]   being more modular, meaning more segmented,
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.220]   like auditory neurons are communicating electrically
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.460]   and chemically, largely with other auditory neurons.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.300]   Of course, they'll communicate
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.700]   with other types of neurons too, right?
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.220]   When I hear something off to my right,
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.060]   you know, like a snap of fingers off to the right,
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.900]   I'll turn my head, and my ability to do that
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.940]   depends on my auditory neurons being linked up
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.640]   with things like my motor system and my visual system.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.460]   But the key thing to understand is that
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.000]   when there is psilocybin present in one system,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.140]   that the communication of any of these pyramidal neurons,
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.300]   the ones involved in hearing,
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.940]   the ones involved in thinking,
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.520]   the ones involved in memory,
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.300]   the ones involved in visual perception
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.580]   or in the generation of visual hallucinations
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.980]   with eyes closed,
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:38.860]   those are all talking to many, many more other neurons,
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.780]   more extensively.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.960]   So what happens effectively is that
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.180]   there's a reduction in the modularity,
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.540]   the separateness of function in the brain
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.100]   and an increase in what's called integration
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.220]   of communication across
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.960]   what would otherwise be disparate brain regions.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.060]   We can say that really simply by saying
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:02.100]   psilocybin increases communication across the brain.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.700]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.260]   there's a reduction in what's called
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.660]   the hierarchical organization of the brain.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.160]   Typically sensory information comes in
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.300]   from the outside environment.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.900]   So we hear something, we see something,
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.100]   we taste something, we smell something.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.060]   And in what's called a bottom up fashion,
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.840]   meaning bottom from the periphery,
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.260]   up, meaning it propagates up through the eyes,
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.660]   through the nose, through the ears,
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.540]   through the skin or the senses in those regions,
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.380]   I should say,
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.880]   up into areas of the brain that sit deep to the cortex,
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.000]   like the thalamus.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.620]   And then the thalamus is sort of a way station.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   It's like a switchboard that sends visual stuff
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.200]   to the visual centers and auditory stuff
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.600]   to the auditory centers and touch stuff to the touch centers
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.620]   and things that maybe trigger a memory
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.400]   off to the memory centers of the brain, et cetera.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.740]   That's the typical organization.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.180]   It's hierarchical because it goes from the periphery
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.060]   up to the more complex processing regions of the brain
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.100]   that make decisions that link all of that stuff
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.240]   to prior experience, maybe plans about the future.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   When psilocybin is present in the system,
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:11.080]   there's a broadening of the flow of that information
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.460]   from the bottom up as well.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.880]   Okay, and that has to do with what's called thalamic gating.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.660]   The thalamus is a very interesting structure.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.720]   We probably don't want to go into it
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   in too much detail right now,
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.080]   but it really is like a switchboard in a way station
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.880]   saying, hey, pay attention to the visual stuff,
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.180]   pay attention to the auditory stuff,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.780]   or just to the visual and auditory stuff,
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.820]   and ignore touch sensation for the time being
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.760]   or vice versa.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.180]   When psilocybin is present in the system
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:40.300]   and when serotonin 2A receptors are activated very strongly,
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.120]   there's a tremendous broadening of the flow of information
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.660]   up and through the thalamus.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.340]   So not only is there more communication
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.800]   of so-called higher order brain centers,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.140]   we refer to them as higher order
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.060]   because they're involved in thinking and decision-making
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.380]   and emotion, et cetera,
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.380]   but there's also a shift in the flow of sensory information
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:02.800]   into the brain that can generally be described as broader
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.360]   and including more blending of the different senses.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.900]   And when I say blending of the senses,
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.540]   I'm also referring to blending of the sense of interoception
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.300]   of our sense of our body
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.260]   and what's happening inside of our body.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:19.660]   And this, without question, at least partially explains
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.820]   why when under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.080]   one's breathing can be linked to a sound,
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.260]   and then suddenly the sound, one thinks,
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.300]   is being controlled by one's breathing
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.200]   or that the sound itself can be linked to something
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.600]   that we see in our mind's eye while in the eye mask.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.960]   Essentially, what I'm describing here
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.560]   is that serotonin 2A receptor activation
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.080]   allows for more broad, less precise,
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.480]   and less hierarchical activation of brain circuitry.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.120]   And when I say hierarchical,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.060]   what I mean is that normally things go from periphery,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.900]   from eyes to thalamus to visual cortex.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.840]   However, when under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.200]   as I mentioned before, even in the eye mask,
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.280]   the visual cortex is going to be very activated
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.540]   even in the absence of any visual input.
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:10.340]   So then if one hears a sound, perhaps from music,
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.080]   a particular motif or voice,
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.440]   and that's linked to a particular emotional state,
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.880]   that is now being blended with visual phenomenon
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.960]   occurring within the brain that have no external stimulus.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.060]   And so while the patterns of activation in the brain
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:26.880]   while under the influence of psilocybin aren't random,
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.080]   they are far less channeled, far less modular,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.300]   and far less hierarchical than would ever be the case
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.420]   when not under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.000]   I'd like to just take a brief break
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.880]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.520]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.160]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.980]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:53.800]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.660]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.320]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.500]   also called neurons.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.120]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.340]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.920]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.460]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.560]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.080]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.120]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.260]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.040]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.300]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.820]   and after physical training as well,
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.620]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.440]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.920]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.580]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:39.560]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.140]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.460]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.740]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.880]   Now, in all fairness to the scientific literature,
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.140]   there are not one, not two, not three,
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.460]   but four prominent theories of which brain networks
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:59.040]   are most activated during a psilocybin
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.460]   or other psychedelic journey.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.860]   And so for those of you that are interested
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.780]   in those different models, first of all,
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.280]   please know that they are not competing models.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.720]   While some of them disagree about some of the details,
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.740]   it's very likely that all of these models are true.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.080]   They include things like changes
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.900]   in the so-called default mode network.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.260]   There's a lot of interest in this.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.540]   I've talked about it before on this podcast,
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.980]   the default mode network, 'cause the network in the brain
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.260]   that's thought to be responsible for spontaneous imagination,
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.500]   for daydreaming, and that reflects sort of
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.380]   the base activation state of the brain
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.480]   when there's no drugs in our system.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.220]   And the default mode network is one of the systems,
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.420]   or networks rather, that is thought to be rewired
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.140]   under conditions of psilocybin or other psychedelics.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.700]   Again, if you're interested in these models
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.000]   and comparing and contrasting them,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.700]   there's a very nice review from Brian Roth's lab at Duke
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.860]   entitled "The Neural Basis of Psychedelic Action"
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.160]   and we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.860]   And again, I just want to emphasize that all of these models
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.900]   have been shown to be true in different studies.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.240]   And what they all point to is more extensive communication
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.980]   between areas of the brain that normally are not as active
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.780]   at the same time while under the influence of psychedelics,
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.580]   such as psilocybin.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.160]   The controversy in the field relates
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.260]   to which of these networks is the one that changes the most
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.620]   to explain the therapeutic outcomes
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.060]   that have been discovered in recent years.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.160]   So again, check out that review
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.980]   if you're interested in that sort of thing.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.700]   In the meantime, we can cut a broad swath
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.660]   through all of those models and just say that psilocybin
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.980]   expands the functional connectivity of the brain
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.420]   while one is under the influence of psilocybin.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.240]   And it does seem that some of that expanded
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.780]   functional connectivity persists
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.820]   after the effects of psilocybin have worn off.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.460]   And that statement about the functional connectivity
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.980]   of the brain being more expanded,
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.660]   not just during the psilocybin session, but after as well,
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.520]   has been substantiated in a number of papers.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.400]   But one of the key papers in this area
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.380]   is one that I recommend people check out
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.940]   if they're interested in this sort of thing
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.340]   is entitled the effects of psilocybin and MDMA
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.340]   on between network resting state functional connectivity
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.620]   in healthy volunteers.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.420]   And I like this paper for a number of reasons.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.980]   First of all, it's a very high quality paper carried out
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:10.140]   in the laboratory of Robin Cardart Harris at UCSF.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.580]   Again, one of the premier researchers
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.620]   in this area of psychedelics and their function,
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.460]   what they do in the brain
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.120]   and also their therapeutic applications,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.320]   but also because it focused on healthy volunteers.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   They explored using brain imaging,
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.780]   what brain areas are active in a resting state.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.620]   So things like default mode network.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.220]   Then they had people take psilocybin or MDMA.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.280]   And then they looked at the connectivity
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.880]   between those brain areas in those same individuals
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.100]   when they were not under the influence of these drugs
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.180]   and found more extensive connectivity.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.520]   All of which pointed to an enhanced lateral connectivity,
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.980]   less hierarchical organization, effectively more
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.780]   interconnection and communication
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.300]   between different brain areas.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.300]   I think not only is the fact that they looked
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.540]   at healthy volunteers very interesting and important,
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.140]   but also that they looked at this resting state
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:58.980]   of the brain.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.740]   They weren't providing a particular auditory
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.900]   or visual stimulus for people to hear or look at
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.180]   while they were in the brain imaging scanner as it's called.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.540]   Rather, they were simply looking at how the brain
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.280]   was behaving at rest.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.420]   And so it's very clear that for people that do two
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.780]   or even just one of these psilocybin journeys
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.400]   at a particular dose,
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.400]   that the brain is actually getting rewired.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.200]   We hear this a lot.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.000]   Psilocybin or other psychedelics lead to plasticity.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.520]   They rewire your brain.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   Let's go back to what we said at the beginning.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.680]   Rewiring of the brain is not the goal.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.860]   Adaptive rewiring of the brain is the goal.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.660]   Rewiring that leads to new ideas that are interesting,
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.440]   that are accessible after the psychedelic journey.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.680]   New ideas and new ways of thinking or feeling
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.000]   that allow people to function better in their lives.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.780]   That's the goal of effective psychedelic therapies,
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   not simply rewiring of the brain.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.240]   You know, a brain injury for that matter
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.760]   will lead to rewiring of the brain,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.780]   but that's maladaptive rewiring.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.240]   The use of things like amphetamines or methamphetamines
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.840]   in particular will lead to rewiring of the brain,
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.000]   but that is strongly maladaptive rewiring.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.200]   So now there are really dozens of studies conducted
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   in humans using brain imaging and other techniques
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.040]   and have evaluated how things like psilocybin
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.640]   change connectivity in the brain.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.720]   And I think the take home message is
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.080]   it expands that connectivity.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.560]   However, it seems to do so in ways that still allow people
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.360]   to function in their daily lives.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.880]   And one of the key things that I gleaned from the literature
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.960]   on the therapeutic use of psilocybin
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.840]   for the treatment of depression is that very seldom
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.120]   do people who take psilocybin experience
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.200]   long-term issues with memory.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.180]   Why is that so critical?
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.880]   Well, you could imagine that increasing connectivity
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.240]   in the brain, reducing modularity,
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.600]   reducing hierarchical organization in the brain
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.320]   would lead to disruptions in memory, right?
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   It's as if you're shuffling books on the bookshelf,
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.080]   so to speak, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.800]   Rather, it seems that the increase in connectivity
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.780]   is leading provided set and setting are correct,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.360]   provided safety protocols are followed
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.540]   to positive rewiring or adaptive rewiring of neural tissue.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.860]   So that's one of the things that makes psychedelics
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.560]   and psilocybin in particular very exciting
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.200]   from the therapeutic standpoint.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.720]   And of course, we have to acknowledge
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.080]   it's also what has a lot of people excited
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.280]   about psychedelics,
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.900]   not just for the treatment of depression,
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.820]   but for expanding the brain's capabilities more generally.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.280]   So along those lines,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.400]   I want to touch on the issues of creativity
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.760]   and the experience of life outside of psychedelic journeys
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.000]   is impacted by psychedelic journeys.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.960]   And here, this relates to a question that I heard a lot
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.980]   when I put the call out on social media
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.640]   that I was going to do this episode,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.480]   and I asked people,
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.300]   what do you want to know about psilocybin?
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.800]   And one of the more common questions that I got was,
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.060]   does it increase creativity?
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.120]   Does it increase our experience of life
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.320]   in ways that are beneficial
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.640]   aside from its now documented positive effects
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.140]   in treating depression and compulsive disorders
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.580]   and addiction?
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:00.460]   And the short answer to this is yes,
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.400]   but that the positive effects of psychedelics,
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.660]   psilocybin in particular,
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.280]   on creativity and our experience of life
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.200]   have only been explored in a fairly narrow set of dimensions.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.640]   However, where it's been explored,
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.000]   there's some really interesting findings.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.140]   So one of the more interesting findings, I think,
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.160]   is a paper entitled
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.920]   Increased Low-Frequency Brain Responses to Music
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.260]   After Psilocybin Therapy for Depression.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.760]   I think this is a really interesting paper
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.800]   because what the authors did is they took advantage
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.520]   of the fact that in these therapeutic psilocybin sessions
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.660]   that are carried out for the treatment of depression,
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.800]   music is being played.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.320]   And there are prior studies showing that
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.040]   when music is played,
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.840]   you activate different brain areas
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.240]   depending on what sort of music is being played.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.920]   That's somewhat obvious, perhaps,
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.800]   sad music versus intense...
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.280]   You could think about heavy metal versus choir music
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.140]   versus Gregorian chants versus punk rock music
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.220]   and on and on.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.340]   It makes sense that different brain areas would be activated
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.280]   when different patterns of music are played.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.560]   However, there do seem to be some universal features
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.820]   of brain activation in response to music.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.840]   This should probably be the topic of an entire episode
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.580]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, and indeed it will be.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.020]   For instance, there are areas of the auditory cortex
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.080]   that are activated, no surprise there,
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.520]   and areas of the brain's reward circuitry,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.320]   the so-called ventral striatum
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.200]   and the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.360]   Talked a lot about these in the episodes about dopamine
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.900]   that I've done previously.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.360]   These are brain areas that lead to the release of dopamine
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.280]   in other brain areas and that reinforce certain experiences
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.460]   and that tend to give us the subjective feeling of,
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.820]   yes, I like this, I want more.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.120]   So in this particular paper,
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.160]   what the authors did is they took advantage of the fact
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.300]   that people are in the clinic, they're on psilocybin,
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:52.040]   they're listening to music, and as you recall,
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.000]   the music played at different stages
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.520]   of the psilocybin journey are different.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.900]   They have a different emotional component,
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.600]   and music is a really nice stimulus in the laboratory,
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.860]   as we say, because like with visual stimuli,
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.680]   you can break it down into high frequency, low frequency.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.640]   Sounds like doon doon or these kinds of things.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.120]   That was my attempt at low frequency
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.980]   versus high frequency auditory stimuli,
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.620]   or at the spatial frequency,
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.000]   or what in the auditory domain
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.360]   would be called the temporal frequency.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.920]   Is it boom, boom, boom, or is it boom, boom, boom, boom?
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.700]   All we've changed there is the temporal frequency.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.060]   The sound was somewhat the same,
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.240]   but the distance between those sounds was different.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.300]   You get the idea.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.900]   So they have access to these people
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.200]   and these different conditions,
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.880]   and they can put them in the brain scanner,
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.940]   and they can do that before and after
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.560]   having taken psilocybin.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.760]   And the long and short of this study
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.380]   is that psilocybin changes one's experience of music,
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.540]   not just during the psilocybin journey itself,
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.500]   but thereafter.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.700]   And in fact, it changes one's emotional response to music
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.380]   in very interesting ways.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.160]   For instance, one of the more common features
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.060]   of major depression is that people don't derive
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.740]   as much pleasure from different types of experiences,
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.580]   whether or not it's food or sex or social experiences,
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.300]   to the point where sometimes they just stop
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.140]   trying to seek out those experiences.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:18.180]   People with depression often feel as if music
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.700]   no longer has the same impact.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.440]   It just doesn't really lift them up very much.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.340]   This study found that people who have taken psilocybin,
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.600]   according to the parameters we talked about earlier,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.420]   can get a return of the elevated emotionality,
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.200]   the positive emotions associated with music
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.600]   that formerly made them feel good.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.000]   In other words, they can feel music again.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.520]   They can feel good in response to music again.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.120]   Now, this is interesting because in theory,
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.660]   it could be that psilocybin simply allowed them
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.420]   to access the emotions around music again more generally,
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.800]   but that's actually not what this paper
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.640]   and some other papers that have been published report.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.380]   Rather, it seems that taking psilocybin
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.960]   can increase one's positive perception of music
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   that one likes and can tone down or reduce the depressiveness
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.920]   or the sadness of music that tends to make one sad,
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.140]   even after the psilocybin has worn off
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.580]   and for a long period of time afterwards,
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.340]   maybe even forever, although no study, of course,
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.260]   can be carried out forever because forever is forever.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.700]   What we do know, however,
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.980]   is that psilocybin can rewire the connections
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.060]   between the emotion centers in the brain
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.520]   and the networks that control auditory perception of music
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.760]   and leads to this condition in which people who felt like,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.780]   I was depressed or I couldn't feel the music,
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.420]   I just wasn't getting the same lift and joy from it again,
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.540]   they can start to experience more joy from that music again
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.440]   and that music that made them feel sad and depressed
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.620]   has a diminished capacity
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   to make them feel sad and depressed.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.840]   And there's a lot of neuroimaging data in this paper
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.400]   that point to the specific brain areas
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.300]   that include areas like the ventral tegmental area
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.940]   that can explain why these sorts of effects will occur.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.340]   So this isn't just subjective reports of people saying,
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.980]   oh yeah, I was depressed and music didn't feel really good,
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:12.180]   now it feels great, or that used to make me feel so sad
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.400]   and now I feel like I have a capacity to listen to that
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.700]   without being crushed by feelings of sadness.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.740]   The paper included some subjective reports of that sort,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.940]   but then was able to link those to changes
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.000]   in brain circuitry and brain activation
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.380]   in response to music using neuroimaging.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.500]   So in that way, it really points to both the subjective
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.300]   and structural and functional changes
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.980]   that psilocybin can bring about
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.660]   through that expanded connectivity between brain areas.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.340]   Because remember, during the psilocybin session,
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.500]   it's not as if music or the perception of music
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.460]   is specifically being looked at
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.140]   or focused on in these studies,
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.420]   rather music is playing, people are in the eye mask,
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.720]   they're feeling all sorts of things,
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.380]   they're breathing, they're hearing, they're touching,
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.740]   it's all happening all at once.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.340]   There's a peak, it's long, there's a long taper,
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.100]   the music's changing.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.280]   All of that took place in this study as well,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.060]   but it is after the session
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.820]   when comparing brain activation states
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.980]   to music of a particular type, sad or happy,
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:14.680]   and comparing that to the patterns of brain activation
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.440]   that occurred before the psilocybin journey,
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.340]   that they discover that people's brains have rewired
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.500]   during the psilocybin session in a way
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.380]   that allows them to experience joy
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.300]   in response to music again.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.900]   So that's one of the more rigorous studies
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.060]   I was able to find that addresses this question
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.460]   of whether or not psilocybin really does rewire the brain
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.900]   in ways that allows us to be more creative
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.900]   and experience life differently after the psilocybin session.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.660]   Now, that paper didn't focus specifically on creativity.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.740]   I did an entire episode on creativity
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.920]   that talked about different types of meditation,
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.460]   like open monitoring meditation.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.780]   It talked about different patterns of thinking
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.440]   that one can actually practice to increase creativity.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.340]   We had arguably one of the most creative people
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.880]   on the planet, Rick Rubin, came on this podcast,
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.160]   talked about the creative process
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.720]   from the perspective of music
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.080]   and his role in producing music.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.540]   So you can check out those episodes
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.960]   if you're interested in the neural circuitry
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.540]   related to creativity.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.020]   At least at the time of recording this episode,
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.320]   there haven't been a lot of studies looking specifically
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.480]   at the brain networks that we think are involved
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.860]   in creativity and how those change
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.620]   in response to psilocybin and other psychedelics.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.540]   I imagine those studies are either happening now
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.360]   or will happen in the future,
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.440]   but the studies I just described,
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.220]   referring to the changes in emotionality
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.660]   and responses to music,
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:33.780]   I think provide a nice template for what's likely happening
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.340]   both during psilocybin journeys
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.140]   and after those psilocybin journeys
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.260]   when we talk about less hierarchical organization,
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.900]   more connectivity between brain areas.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.300]   What it's pointing to is the fact
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.660]   that during the psilocybin journey,
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:49.140]   people have the opportunity to learn new relationships
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.600]   between different sensory and emotional states.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.980]   And those new relationships seem to persist
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.020]   long after the psychedelic journey has been finished.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.900]   And a lot of people researching psilocybin
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.740]   in the clinical setting think that that's one
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:06.020]   of the major reasons why psilocybin and other psychedelics
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.620]   can rewire our relationship to things more broadly.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.300]   It allows for new learning, new contingencies.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.300]   And when we look at depression,
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.280]   we often think, you know, diminished mood,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.540]   people now have an appetite,
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.340]   they're not interested in social relationships
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.620]   or romantic relationships, they're really struggling.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.900]   And all of that, of course, is true.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.060]   But another lens to look at depression through
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.560]   is that a lot of that thinking
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.920]   and a lot of those emotional states that are negative
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.020]   are somewhat habitual.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.860]   They relate to a sort of implicit understanding
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:37.360]   and living out of the idea that A leads to B leads to C.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.740]   Okay, you seek out a relationship, it doesn't work out.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.420]   Try a new job, you don't get the job.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.740]   You get the job, it's no good.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.700]   All these negative outcomes of if A, then B, then C.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.720]   And it does seem that psilocybin can have this effect
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.540]   of invoking new patterns of learning,
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.220]   new considerations about what might be possible,
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.280]   and indeed may even lead to actual rewiring
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.760]   of the emotion centers in the brain
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.260]   with these other brain areas and vice versa
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.540]   in ways that eject people from the psilocybin session
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.420]   thinking, oh, you know, yeah,
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.460]   I used to feel this way about something,
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.820]   work, relationships, myself, et cetera,
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.860]   but I'm willing to consider this other possibility
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.500]   or this other possibility seems at least partially true
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.020]   to the extent that I'm willing to go out and evaluate that.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.740]   Now, here I'm speaking very subjectively,
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:24.300]   but remember we have to tie back the subjective experiences
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.660]   and changes of things like music and emotion
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.960]   and our relationship to life and jobs and relationships
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.660]   back to the cell biology and chemistry of psilocybin
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.340]   because ultimately it really is
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.380]   just a chemical activating receptors,
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:38.220]   those receptors changing networks in the brain,
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:42.340]   and the journey itself seems to be the time
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.700]   when all of those changes are put in motion.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.200]   It's like a boulder that gets rolling.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.980]   In fact, I think the best way
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.540]   to think about psilocybin and other psychedelics
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.500]   is that they initiate the neuroplasticity process,
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.260]   but they are not the neuroplasticity process itself,
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.700]   and the journey itself
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.900]   is not where all the neuroplasticity occurs.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.980]   We know that for sure.
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.900]   In fact, if you want to imagine
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.500]   how psilocybin and other psychedelics work
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.580]   to change the brain,
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:12.300]   think about them as a wedge that gets underneath the boulder
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.920]   that is the neuroplasticity that gets rolling forward,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.700]   and then think about whether or not
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.060]   the plasticity is adaptive or maladaptive,
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.920]   whether or not it actually serves you in your life
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.000]   on a daily basis or not,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.460]   depending on whether or not
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.300]   you're using your conscious brain
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.860]   to move that boulder in a particular direction, right?
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.180]   Not just bulldozing through things and destroying them,
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.660]   but clearing a path through old, ineffective,
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.640]   maybe even destructive patterns of thoughts
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.380]   or emotions, et cetera.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.300]   I give you that analogy
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.280]   because I think it more accurately captures
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.160]   what psychedelics like psilocybin are doing,
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.560]   rather than the typical discussion around psychedelics
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.400]   that we tend to hear,
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.180]   which is that, oh, it creates plasticity,
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.940]   and plasticity is what you want.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:53.940]   For the next couple of minutes,
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.380]   I'd like to focus on some of the key and stereotype
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.140]   that is characteristic experiences
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.000]   that people tend to have during a psilocybin journey,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.040]   because there's some really interesting research on this.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.540]   These are phrases that perhaps you've heard before,
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.840]   things like letting go, ego dissolution,
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.740]   feelings of connectedness.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.700]   While all of that is very subjective on the one hand,
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:19.640]   those words are heard often enough and repeatedly enough
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.100]   in psilocybin sessions and after psilocybin sessions,
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.120]   along with this description of the psilocybin experience
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.200]   as one of the most profound of one's life,
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.880]   or one of the most positive, in the ideal case,
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.540]   of one's life, that they are worth exploring.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:37.740]   We should also, of course, explore the so-called bad trip,
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.020]   the possibility that someone will have a not good time
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.860]   or even very frightening time
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.360]   while under the influence of psilocybin.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.320]   So there have been some scientific studies
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.300]   that have explored what sorts of subjective experiences,
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.500]   that is thoughts and feelings,
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.560]   insights that people have,
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.300]   that relate to positive therapeutic outcomes,
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.580]   and more generally with the sense
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.580]   that the psilocybin journey was positive
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.580]   or maybe even tremendously positive in one's life.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.260]   So while there's a century or more
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.060]   of writings about psychedelics that describe things
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.800]   like enhanced feelings of connectedness
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.380]   or dissolution of the ego, the loss of one's sense of self,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.340]   and then the regaining of one's sense of self and so on,
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.020]   there's a particular paper that describes
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.540]   some of those things in terms of rating scales,
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.980]   that is the sorts of tests that people can take
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.280]   in which they answer particular questions
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.980]   and that link back to things like feelings of connectedness
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.700]   and ego dissolution that allows us to put some numbers
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.860]   to those experiences and to look at some of the statistics
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.220]   associated with those experiences.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.200]   And this is really what's important
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.580]   about scientific studies,
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.160]   whether or not a measure is subjective,
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.740]   so if someone's self-reporting how they felt or feel,
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   or whether or not it's measure of blood pressure
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.540]   or of a chemical in the bloodstream, et cetera,
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.180]   it's the use of numbers and statistics
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.540]   that allows comparison between different groups
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.340]   and that can be compared between studies
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.740]   that allows us to make some firm conclusions
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.300]   about what sorts of things psilocybin may
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.860]   or may not be doing when it's effective or not.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.820]   So the paper I'd like to highlight is entitled
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.340]   "Quality of Acute Psychedelic Experience
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.640]   Predicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.980]   for Treatment-Resisted Depression."
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.940]   I'll put a link to this paper in the show note captions.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.100]   But the basic contour of this paper is that
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.280]   they looked at subjects that underwent
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.660]   two different psilocybin sessions,
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:23.460]   one at a relatively low-ish dose
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.300]   of 10 milligrams of psilocybin.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.200]   Again, that would be equivalent to about one gram
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.860]   of psychedelic mushrooms, more or less.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.620]   And a second session involving subjects
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.660]   taking 25 milligrams of psilocybin,
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.660]   or what's roughly equivalent to somebody taking
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.620]   two and a half grams of psilocybin mushrooms.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:44.220]   Those people then answered what's called
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:47.140]   the altered states of consciousness questionnaire,
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.960]   which allowed them to address, and here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.560]   the quality of experiences
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.440]   in the 25 milligrams psilocybin session.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.160]   So without going into too much detail,
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.860]   it's often the case in these sorts of two-session studies
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.760]   that subjects will take a slightly lower dose of psilocybin
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.080]   to familiarize themselves with the experience,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.560]   and then the higher dose that leads
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.180]   to the more intense experience,
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.860]   intense meaning a bigger, more intense peak,
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.900]   a longer session overall,
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.940]   greater distortions in emotionality
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:13.920]   and perceptual experience,
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.000]   all the stuff we talked about before.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.380]   So what this study found is that one of the key features,
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:23.380]   if not the key feature of a positive, quote unquote,
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.520]   psychedelic experience is this sense
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.840]   of oceanic boundlessness occurring at some point
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.200]   during the psychedelic journey.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.360]   Now, oceanic boundlessness doesn't necessarily mean anything
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.920]   to any of us.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.320]   It probably means different things to different people.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.760]   It's this idea that one is experiencing
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.360]   something extremely unusual, even mystical,
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.280]   kind of beyond this world and one's normal experience,
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.540]   but that it's not aligned
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.840]   with any specific outcome in the moment.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.900]   It's not directly attached to any one feeling
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.240]   or memory or thought process.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.600]   It's this, I think it's a little bit tough to describe
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.560]   because I can guarantee you,
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.840]   I'm not on psilocybin or any psychedelics right now,
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.260]   and I can only imagine that you're not,
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.640]   although some of you might be.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.240]   I can't even imagine what this podcast would be like
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.920]   for somebody on psilocybin at this moment.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.800]   But in any case, oceanic boundlessness,
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.200]   a feeling of the experience being mystical
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.780]   and not really heading in any one particular direction,
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.480]   just a feeling of massive connectedness
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.960]   with one's environment, both in the room and session,
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.820]   perhaps with the guides, with oneself, with one's past,
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.840]   with one's present, people outside the room,
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.040]   with the entire world, maybe even the universe,
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.460]   that sort of thing.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:43.040]   The intensity of that experience of oceanic boundlessness,
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.320]   the mystical experience,
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.720]   seems to be positively correlated
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.600]   with positive therapeutic outcomes,
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.520]   that is relief from major depression.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.440]   Now, during the psychedelic journey,
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.480]   as we talked about before,
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.220]   there are a number of steps that one typically goes through.
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:02.100]   So there's the buildup to first experiencing the effects
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.880]   of the drug about maybe 20 to 45 minutes
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.120]   into the journey or trip, then the peak.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.200]   And it is during that peak that people often feel
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.440]   the sense of oceanic boundlessness.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.480]   However, it's also often the case
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.560]   that it is during the peak
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.840]   where the maximum intensity of emotion,
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.960]   and we know based on direct measurements,
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.980]   also increases in blood pressure and heart rate,
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:33.680]   often very significant increases in anxiety and fear as well,
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.120]   that people will experience things like ego dissolution.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.960]   And the guide's role at that point is, of course,
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.040]   to keep the person safe,
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.320]   make sure they don't run out of the room,
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.380]   jump out of a window, run into traffic.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.200]   Sadly, these are things that have happened
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   outside of a strong, healthy, safe set and setting.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.900]   But the guide's role is to keep the person safe,
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:56.620]   but also to encourage them to let go
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.380]   and move through that experience,
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.380]   to experience the anxiety, allow it to peak,
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.340]   allow them to see that they're not going to die
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.220]   from that anxiety, they're not going to dissolve,
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.840]   they won't lose their sense of self completely,
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.240]   or they may temporarily feel
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.900]   as if they lose their sense of self,
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.280]   but then they feel it restored
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.980]   at various intervals during the peak
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:18.800]   or as they exit that peak and move toward the, say,
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.640]   second, third, fourth, fifth hour of the session.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.080]   So when exactly these feelings of oceanic boundlessness
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.620]   and ego dissolution occur varies from person to person,
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.440]   but typically it's during the peak that the ego dissolution,
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.800]   the fear and the need to quote unquote let go
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.500]   is most typical.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.880]   I think perhaps the best way to describe the data
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.680]   in this paper in a way that's meaningful to everybody
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.760]   is to refer you to figure two,
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.480]   which if you're not looking at the paper,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.200]   won't mean anything to you, but I'll describe it.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   And if you do want to take a look at figure two,
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.840]   again, you can access the paper in the show note captions.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.920]   What they did is they looked
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.360]   at a number of different subjective measures,
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.240]   things like experience of unity,
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:03.460]   the feeling that one is connected to others and to the world,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.200]   things like spirituality,
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.320]   whether or not the whole thing felt
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.720]   like a spiritual experience,
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.180]   whether or not it was a blissful state,
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.340]   whether or not there were insights,
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.600]   whether or not somebody felt disembodied, out of body,
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.520]   whether or not somebody had a lot of anxiety,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.040]   whether or not they had these synesthesia,
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.740]   these blending of visual auditory touch and breathing
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.000]   and things of that sort.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.320]   And they addressed which of those measures
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.000]   related to the positive clinical outcomes
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.280]   that were observed later after the psilocybin wore off.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.540]   And while I'm not going to go point by point
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.160]   through each one of these measures,
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   there's a general feature to emerge from the study,
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.300]   which is that the experience of unity,
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:44.000]   the sense that the psilocybin journey was spiritual,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.740]   an experience of bliss at some point
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.440]   inside of the psilocybin journey,
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.680]   the sense that there were insights,
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.400]   that there were learnings about one's life and oneself.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.240]   When those things were experienced very strongly,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.760]   that correlated with the person being what was called
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.680]   a responder to the psilocybin treatment,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.840]   meaning they got relief from their depression.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.200]   Whereas people who felt less of that, okay,
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.860]   so the non-responders, as they're called,
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.300]   the people who do not benefit so much in the long run
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.200]   from the psilocybin treatment,
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.840]   tended to report less of an experience of unity,
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.380]   less of a spiritual experience,
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   less of a blissful state, less insightfulness, and so on.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.800]   Whereas there were very few differences
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.320]   between the people that derived benefit
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.860]   from the psilocybin treatment and those did not,
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.360]   along the dimensions of synesthesia,
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.980]   this blending of different perceptions
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.540]   that ordinarily doesn't occur for most people.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.380]   Or complex imagery, right?
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.220]   Put simply, everyone who took psilocybin in this study
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.980]   at 25 milligrams saw complex imagery.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.420]   They saw a lot of hallucinations,
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.380]   but just seeing hallucinations did not lead
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.980]   to the positive clinical outcomes in terms of mood.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.960]   Anxiety was a very interesting measure here
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.620]   because ordinarily we think of the ego dissolution,
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.360]   the letting go is such a key component
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.640]   of the psychedelic journey
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.540]   in terms of the positive therapeutic outcomes.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.260]   This has been discussed quite a lot.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.640]   And in full disclosure, Robin Carter-Harris
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.420]   has already come on to record an episode
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.500]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.920]   That episode hasn't been released yet,
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.100]   but it will be released soon.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.060]   And he talks about the importance of this letting go
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.460]   in terms of the positive clinical outcomes
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.520]   of the psilocybin journey.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.280]   And indeed that is true.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.220]   And I should also mention that Dr. Matthew Johnson
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.740]   from Johns Hopkins, who also runs a laboratory
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   exploring psychedelics and their role in treating things
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.020]   like eating disorders and depression, et cetera,
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.420]   also doing incredible work,
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.680]   also talked about the importance of letting go
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.720]   during the psilocybin journey, this ego dissolution,
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.460]   this ability to move through the anxiety.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.540]   And again, I can't underscore this enough
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.820]   because it's been told to me over and over again
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.060]   by the top researchers in this area
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.820]   that people will head into that peaking phase
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:49.980]   of the psilocybin journey.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:52.220]   And oftentimes it is not pleasant for them.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.200]   They're feeling like it's uncomfortable, it's scary,
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.260]   and their heart rate is up and their blood pressure is up
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.220]   and they're having a hard time calming down
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.340]   than they want to calm down.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.080]   But it does seem that while the guides
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.160]   should not ramp them up and get them more stressed,
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.360]   that the ability to move through that stressful period,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.460]   to somewhat guide oneself or to be encouraged
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.420]   to guide oneself through that peak
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.800]   and that anxiety and the fear of losing oneself
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.180]   and the so-called ego dissolution that occurs
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.260]   is an important feature
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.240]   for an effective therapeutic session.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.340]   In this study, anxiety itself was inversely correlated
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.900]   with a positive therapeutic outcome.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.180]   Okay, so this is important and somewhat nuanced.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.900]   On the one hand, I'm telling you that the letting go,
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.460]   the ego dissolution does seem to be important
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.540]   in terms of reporting a psychedelic experience
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.860]   as effective as having accomplished something
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:46.500]   and perhaps even explaining some of the long-term
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.780]   positive effects to emerge from that psychedelic journey,
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.920]   in this case, psilocybin journey.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   However, non-responders, that is people who did psilocybin
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.080]   but did not have a positive therapeutic outcome
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.360]   in comparison to the responders,
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.420]   those non-responders tended to have higher
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.900]   subjective ratings of anxiety than did the responders.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.100]   So this is important and what it speaks to is the fact that,
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.140]   well, yes, letting go during the session,
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.700]   experiencing some anxiety,
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.000]   perhaps even ego dissolution and the dissolving of self
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.860]   and then the return of self is important.
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.740]   It is also important, it seems,
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.140]   that anxiety not be so, so high
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.180]   or subjectively experienced as so high
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.480]   that one does not experience the positive neuronal rewiring
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.580]   that leads to a more pervasive elevated mood, okay?
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.100]   So I'm definitely saying two things at once
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.000]   because I'm trying to capture the data accurately.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.860]   It would not be fair for me to say,
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:49.740]   just let go, experience as much anxiety as is possible
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.720]   and that's part of the process.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.680]   Yes, letting go, again, in air quotes,
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.020]   seems to be important for one's experience
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.340]   of the psychedelic journey in particular around the peak
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.960]   that occurs about two hours in or so.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.140]   However, extreme levels of anxiety
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.920]   seem inversely correlated or negatively correlated,
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.220]   would be the better way to put it,
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.360]   with the positive therapeutic outcome
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.140]   or relief from depression.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.160]   So this takes us back to all of the things
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.020]   we've been talking about thus far,
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.520]   not just the chemistry and biological action of psilocybin,
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.880]   but the key importance of getting dosage right,
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.340]   the key importance of making sure
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.700]   that you're in a safe environment,
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.100]   but also one in which the guides
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.540]   really know what they're doing.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.300]   I think this is one of the biggest
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.140]   and most important reasons for having well-trained guides,
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:38.780]   who really understand the contour of the psychedelic journey
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.720]   but are also trained in how to help somebody
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.220]   with their anxiety in real time
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:46.380]   while they're under the effects of psilocybin.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.780]   And of course, to help people integrate
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.060]   those feelings of high anxiety
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   and maybe guide them back down to a calmer state
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:54.420]   during the psychedelic session itself.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:57.680]   Here I can just mention some unpublished data and studies,
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.420]   and again, this are very preliminary,
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.380]   but through discussions with Dr. Matthew Johnson,
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.620]   who's running these psilocybin
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.740]   and other sorts of psychedelic trials at Johns Hopkins,
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:09.100]   he and I discussed the importance
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.940]   of having a real-time tool to adjust anxiety
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.460]   while under the influence of psychedelics like psilocybin.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.580]   And there he asked,
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.140]   and they've started to incorporate, is my understanding,
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.620]   some of the real-time respiration tools,
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.100]   that is, breathing tools that we know,
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.340]   based on work in my laboratory,
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:28.220]   Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory,
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.900]   can reduce anxiety very quickly in real time,
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:33.480]   and that involves the use of the so-called physiological psi.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.980]   I've talked a lot about this before on previous podcasts,
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.340]   so rather than explain it to you again here now,
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.180]   we'll put a link to the physiological psi.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.780]   I do a demonstration of it in the show note captions.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:44.260]   I'll also link to a recent paper
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.920]   that we published in Cell Reports Medicine.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.160]   This was a collaborative work that my laboratory did
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.520]   with Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.140]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.580]   showing that the physiological psi
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.240]   is among the different deliberate respiration techniques,
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.200]   one of the fastest and most effective ways
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.560]   to reduce levels of autonomic arousal,
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.520]   AKA anxiety or stress.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.540]   And Dr. Matthew Johnson's laboratory
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:08.280]   has started to incorporate physiological psi
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.260]   within these psychedelic sessions
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.580]   as a tool that the guides can refer people to
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.620]   before the session begins, teaching it to them,
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.620]   so they realize they can calm themselves down,
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.940]   if necessary, in real time.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.160]   It works the first time, it works every time.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.460]   This is not because it's some magic breathing technique
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.980]   that I created, it certainly is not.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.260]   This is a naturally occurring pattern of breathing
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:29.540]   that occurs in sleep and in waking,
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:33.040]   but that when done deliberately leads to very rapid
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.720]   and quite significant decreases in stress and anxiety.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.980]   And then when people are inside of the psychedelic session,
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.260]   if they feel their anxiety levels are going too high,
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.160]   they're heading toward what might be called
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.200]   a quote unquote bad trip, they're starting to panic
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.080]   or really think they're going to have a panic attack or die.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.060]   Again, the subjective experience is going to be layered
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.760]   on top of the physiological experience
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.600]   of one's heart rate being really elevated,
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.660]   so stress and agitation.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.200]   By using the physiological psi
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:02.080]   inside of the psychedelic session, Dr. Johnson's laboratory,
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.420]   and I believe at least one other laboratory
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.860]   are starting to use breathing techniques,
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.500]   such as the physiological psi, as a way for these people
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.900]   who are under the influence of psilocybin
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:14.480]   to self-direct their own calm
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.980]   and to bring that level of anxiety down
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:19.300]   so that they can continue to move through the peak
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.460]   and move through the other phases of the psychedelic journey
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.980]   in ways that could be most beneficial for them.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.280]   So to close out the description
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.000]   of this really wonderful study,
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:28.880]   and by the way, it's another one
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.380]   from the Carthart-Harris Laboratory,
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:34.420]   about the subjective experience of ego dissolution
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:36.940]   or oceanic boundlessness, this mystical state,
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:41.340]   as so key as a component of a positive psilocybin journey.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.340]   I'll just read for you the final sentence of this paper
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.660]   because it captures it so well.
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.620]   Quote, "It seems vital that appropriate consideration
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.080]   is paid to the importance of promoting
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.100]   a certain kind of experience,
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.600]   as the quality of that experience
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.440]   may be the critical determinant of therapeutic success."
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.120]   Now, before we move into what will be
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.340]   a very brief description of some of the other
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:04.080]   rewiring phenomena that psilocybin can induce,
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.960]   and then into some of the therapeutic applications
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.940]   of psilocybin as they relate to these recent,
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.120]   really exciting clinical trials for depression
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.620]   and addictive disorders and things of that sort,
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.280]   I just want to cue everybody to a paper
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.760]   that I think many people will want to take a look at
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.940]   in thinking about psilocybin,
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.620]   and I'll provide a link to this paper as well
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.100]   in the show note captions.
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.800]   This paper is entitled "Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin,
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.220]   Practical Considerations for Dosing and Administration."
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.000]   And this is a wonderful paper
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.680]   because it really goes step-by-step
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.620]   through the pharmacology of psilocybin,
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.000]   of which you now understand a bit,
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.100]   but it goes into a bit more detail.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.220]   But then it also really nicely describes
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.840]   the contour of a psilocybin session
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.260]   and what's happening at the level of chemistry,
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.100]   early, middle, peak,
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.820]   and toward the end of the psilocybin session.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.400]   And then also importantly,
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.700]   it gets into issues of dosage and translating
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.520]   from mushrooms to psilocybin itself, to psilocin,
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.700]   things I talked about earlier, but in a bit more detail,
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.100]   if you'd like to see that detail.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.840]   And then perhaps most importantly,
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.560]   there's a section on contraindications
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.860]   where it points out that, of course,
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:11.340]   women who are pregnant or breastfeeding,
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.040]   people who have a predisposition to psychosis,
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.580]   those people should really avoid the use of psilocybin
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.880]   and other psychedelics entirely.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.540]   It also talks about where the evidence
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.340]   is strong, moderate, and weak
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:29.040]   for the use of psilocybin for treatment of various disorders.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040]   And I can just summarize that very quickly
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.620]   because it's where we're going ahead in a few minutes,
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.100]   which is that the most evidence
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:38.000]   for positive therapeutic outcomes response to psilocybin
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.620]   taken and conducted in the manner
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.720]   that we've been describing today
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.180]   in terms of dosage and journey set and setting
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.580]   is for cancer-related depression,
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.700]   cancer-related anxiety,
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.840]   and treatment-resistant depression.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.100]   That's where most of the evidence resides.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.840]   There's also some evidence
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.460]   for the use of psilocybin journeys.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.280]   And again, this is typically one or two psilocybin journeys
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.060]   spaced, in the cases of two journeys,
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.540]   anywhere from one to two weeks apart.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:09.580]   And again, with all of the same contour of supports
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.300]   and setting that we've been talking about today.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.420]   And there, there's some evidence for improvement
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:18.420]   in terms of outcomes in alcohol use disorder independence
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.900]   and tobacco addiction.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.700]   And then finally, there's the least amount of evidence,
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:24.740]   although there is clinical trial support
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:27.180]   for relief or partial relief,
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:30.080]   for obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.040]   cluster headaches and migraines,
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.600]   and demoralization due to AIDS diagnosis, okay?
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.840]   So this paper has a lot of really interesting information
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.860]   in terms of different conditions, in terms of dosage,
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.060]   and again, contraindications
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.080]   and what's called adverse events.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.740]   What sorts of bad things can and do happen
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.140]   as a consequence of psilocybin and other types
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:52.980]   of psychedelic journeys,
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.740]   both during and after those psilocybin
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.780]   or psychedelic sessions.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.300]   And we'll talk a bit more about this
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.060]   when we go into some of those clinical studies,
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.660]   because adverse reactions is always a key measure
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.980]   in any clinical study.
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:06.500]   So very soon we'll get into the more recent clinical studies
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:10.140]   related to psilocybin for the use of treating depression
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.640]   and some other conditions.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.380]   But before we do that, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.220]   how psilocybin does and does not change the brain,
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.300]   what is and what is not known about that.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.660]   In fact, when I put out the call
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.900]   for questions about psilocybin,
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:27.060]   many of the questions related to these issues.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.860]   The first thing to understand is that a psilocybin journey
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:34.020]   is really a way to try and put that wedge under the boulder,
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.940]   as I described it, to try and invoke neuroplasticity
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.540]   of a particular kind.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.060]   And in that way, it's kind of remarkable,
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.820]   if you think about it, that everyone has different lives,
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.060]   different experiences, psychedelics, in this case, psilocybin,
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.980]   are activating these brain networks that each of us has
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.380]   more broadly than they would normally be activated.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.140]   These are very abnormal patterns of thinking and perceiving
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.420]   and experiencing our emotional and physical life, et cetera.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:03.340]   And yet so often the outcomes are positive, not always,
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:05.620]   but the outcomes are positive, the experience is positive,
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.760]   even though it might have these anxiety moments
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.420]   or components within them.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:13.060]   It's very important to understand that psilocybin
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.800]   and the journey, while important,
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.720]   are not really what all of this is about.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.960]   It's really about neuroplasticity.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.260]   So researchers, in particular neuroscientists,
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.880]   are very intensely interested in understanding
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.040]   what sorts of neuroplasticity psilocybin creates,
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.700]   because it turns out there are lots of different types
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:34.260]   or processes involved with neuroplasticity.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:38.700]   For instance, brain networks, behavior, thinking, emotion,
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.740]   et cetera, can change because of the addition of new neurons.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.380]   That's one form of neuroplasticity
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.980]   that's referred to as neurogenesis,
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.540]   the production of new neurons,
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.300]   most typically in the so-called dentate gyrus
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:51.200]   or other subregions of the hippocampus,
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.980]   a brain area involved in learning and memory.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:59.060]   Neurogenesis in other regions of the adult human brain
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.460]   are exceedingly rare, and to be honest,
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:02.560]   may not occur at all.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.040]   This is a debated area.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.720]   We could do an entire episode about this,
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.180]   but for the most part,
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.920]   neuroscientists don't really believe that your neocortex,
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.980]   your striatum, your cerebellum,
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.560]   has that much neurogenesis that's related
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.760]   to learning and memory of new things or new experiences,
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.680]   and we don't actually think that occurs
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.580]   as a consequence of taking psilocybin either.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.780]   Now, some of you who are familiar with, for instance,
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.960]   the cerebellum might be saying,
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:32.180]   wait, what about granular cell proliferation
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.180]   in the cerebellum?
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.700]   Or what about the rostral migratory stream
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:39.540]   from the subventricular zone where there are neuroblasts
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:42.020]   spitting out little new neurons that migrate into the nose
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.420]   to replenish the olfactory neuron population?
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.780]   Yes, that's all true.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.740]   That does occur.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.920]   It's been observed in mice, it's been observed in monkeys,
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.840]   and to some extent, it's been observed in humans,
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.120]   but it's not, again, I repeat,
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.060]   it is not a prominent feature of learning
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.740]   and acquisition of new skills,
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.680]   new ideas, or new emotional states.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.900]   Perhaps the best supported evidence for neurogenesis
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:09.420]   underlying new thoughts, experiences, abilities,
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.080]   emotions, et cetera, is the production of new neurons
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.580]   in that dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus,
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.580]   and that probably does occur in humans,
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:20.700]   but neurogenesis is not really the dominant mode
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.360]   of changing neural circuitry in adult humans.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   It might be a player in adolescence, in young childhood.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.120]   It is certainly a player before we are born
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.140]   when we are still in utero,
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:35.620]   but then the brain is being wired up in many different ways,
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.980]   including the addition of new neurons
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:38.900]   and changing of connections.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.900]   All of this is to say that while neurogenesis
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:45.420]   is a really sticky idea and it makes great headlines,
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:47.440]   the addition of new neurons is not really the way
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.460]   that the brain changes under psilocybin,
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:53.780]   other psychedelics, or just generally.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:57.660]   It's perhaps responsible for maybe 1% to 2%,
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.540]   and I'm being generous there, of the rewiring events
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:03.180]   that are going to be most important for all of us.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.420]   So we need to set that down and cement that there
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.780]   until further evidence comes out to the contrary.
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:09.860]   That's certainly where I,
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:11.740]   and here I feel comfortable speaking
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.380]   for the majority of neuroscientists out there,
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.720]   professional neuroscientists, that is.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.020]   The papers showing adult neurogenesis are interesting,
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.940]   but they don't really explain most of the plasticity
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.740]   that occurs in the adult human brain.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:27.200]   So if neurogenesis ain't it, what is?
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.380]   Well, it's very clear that psilocybin, other psychedelics,
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.160]   and any sort of behavioral or drug intervention
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.780]   that can induce neuroplasticity does so largely
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.980]   through the addition or strengthening
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.220]   of new neural connections or through the elimination
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:45.200]   or weakening of other neural connections.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:49.220]   And if you look at the data exploring the mechanistic basis
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:52.800]   for psilocybin-induced neuroplasticity,
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.860]   it's mostly focused on animal brains, animal models,
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:59.460]   mice and rats in particular, a little bit on primates,
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.020]   but mostly mice and rats because that's where
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.780]   the interventions can be done of knockout animals,
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.300]   of imaging the brain in real time.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.340]   Of course, there are the beautiful studies
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:12.080]   of Robin Cardart-Harris and others exploring neuroplasticity
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:13.540]   at the level of brain imaging,
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:15.420]   at the level of ultrasound measurements,
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.820]   of how active are certain brain areas in humans,
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:20.180]   how extensive is the modularity
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.780]   or not extensive is the modularity, et cetera,
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.020]   the stuff we talked about earlier.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.260]   So in other words, there are neuroplasticity studies
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.020]   with the effects of psilocybin in humans.
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:31.420]   But in terms of underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity,
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.700]   I think the predominant theory is that psilocybin
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.260]   induces neuroplasticity through the addition
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:40.340]   of novel connections in those pyramidal neurons
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.400]   of the frontal cortex, elsewhere in the cortex,
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.540]   and certainly also in the visual cortex,
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.260]   probably also subcortically as well,
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:49.500]   below the cerebral cortex in areas like the thalamus,
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.100]   maybe even in the brainstem as well.
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.220]   And that those neuroplasticity events
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   are structural and functional.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.220]   And they involve a couple of basic events,
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.020]   the most prominent of which is the growth of dendrites.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.260]   Dendrites are those little branches or processes
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.180]   that come out of the neurons,
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.520]   not just the pyramidal neurons, but other neurons as well.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.460]   But since we're talking mainly
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.000]   about pyramidal neurons today,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.820]   both the apical, those ones that top,
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:12.660]   they're called the apical tufts,
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.800]   they're the ones that reach laterally
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.260]   to connect with other neurons,
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.940]   communicate with other neurons that we talked about before,
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.060]   as well as the dendrites that come out of the base
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.640]   of those pyramidal neurons.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.540]   Those processes grow in response to psilocybin,
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:27.940]   as well as the addition of what are called dendritic spines.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:30.020]   So the dendrites are the branches,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:32.380]   the spines are these little protrusions that grow out.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.740]   They actually, and here,
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.860]   I don't know if this is coincidence or not.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.300]   Again, I always say, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.280]   but these little protrusions
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.060]   actually look like little mushrooms.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.220]   They have a little stalk and they have a little head,
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.780]   a little spine head, and those little spines.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.360]   So think of these as like little tiny mushroom appearing.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.900]   Okay, they aren't actual mushrooms.
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:54.200]   Okay, the first person that puts in the comments,
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.500]   oh my goodness, I learned today
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.400]   that mushrooms grow out of our neurons
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.540]   when we take magic mushrooms.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.180]   That is not what I'm saying.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.520]   What I'm saying is that these little mushroom-shaped
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.060]   protrusions that we're calling dendritic spines
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:09.360]   do in fact grow out of dendritic branches of neurons
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:13.180]   when animals ingest psilocybin
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:15.140]   or are injected with psilocybin,
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:18.060]   and that those little mushroom-shaped protrusions
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:21.140]   are the sites of new excitatory connections,
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:25.220]   new locations for input from other neurons
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.260]   to activate those neurons
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:29.620]   that have those little mushroom-shaped protrusions.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.260]   If you'd like to see examples of this,
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.940]   both movies and still shots, it's pretty remarkable.
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:35.420]   There's a paper that I'll provide a link to
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:36.340]   in the show note captions.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.180]   This was published in the journal Neuron,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.860]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.540]   entitled "Psilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:45.720]   "of dendritic spines in the frontal cortex in vivo."
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.140]   So these measurements were done in the mouse equivalent,
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.380]   more or less, of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:52.300]   There's some interesting details in this paper,
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:55.060]   for instance, that those new connections persist,
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.420]   so they don't just grow out during the psilocybin
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.220]   being active in the bloodstream and brain of the animal,
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.360]   they persist, okay?
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.020]   So this may, again, may explain
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.740]   some of the persistent changes that occur in people
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.460]   after psilocybin journeys.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:11.580]   They may too grow new spines.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:13.420]   I should also mention that a reduction
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:14.820]   in the number of dendritic spines,
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.400]   these little mushroom-shaped protrusions,
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:19.540]   in the frontal cortex neurons of humans
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.180]   occurs in depressed patients,
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:23.260]   we know that from post-mortem tissue,
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:26.380]   and that drugs that relieve depression or that treatments,
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.620]   including behavioral treatments,
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:31.260]   that provide some relief from depression
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:34.580]   do seem to be correlated with increases in spine growth
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.400]   in frontal cortex neurons as well.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.100]   So this raises a very interesting idea,
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:42.340]   which is perhaps it's the growth of new connections,
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:44.740]   these new dendritic spines, in particular neurons,
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:47.940]   that's created by administration of psilocybin
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.840]   that explains the relief from depression
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:50.980]   that people experience.
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:52.260]   So this is just one paper,
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:55.640]   but it's one paper of a growing body of work
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.560]   showing that yes, indeed, psilocybin induces
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.640]   both structural and functional plasticity
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.180]   in the human and animal brain.
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.380]   It does that in the human brain at therapeutic doses
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:08.280]   of anywhere from 10 to 25,
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.020]   perhaps even 30 milligrams per session,
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.540]   one or two sessions.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:13.800]   I should mention that the mouse studies
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.120]   tended to use quite high doses of psilocybin.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.080]   I was actually, I wasn't shocked,
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.240]   but I was somewhat wide-eyed for a moment
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.660]   to realize that most of the studies
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:26.860]   looking at changes in plasticity in the mouse brain
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.140]   in response to psilocybin use the equivalent
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:32.240]   of one milligram per kilogram of body weight,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.640]   which is if you do the math and you translate
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.420]   what we were talking about before in terms of dosages,
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:38.540]   I'll just spare you all the time,
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:41.260]   it's about double the sorts of dosages
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:42.980]   that are typically used in humans,
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.980]   maybe even triple in some cases.
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.060]   Now it's often the case in animal studies
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.320]   because of the metabolism of animals being different,
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.920]   but also because seeing effects of drugs
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.880]   in animal studies can be difficult.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.960]   They did use a dose response anywhere from zero
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.460]   to 0.25 to half to one to two milligrams
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.900]   per kilogram of psilocybin in the study.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.560]   So they had a dose response curve,
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.220]   but focused mainly on this one milligram
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.160]   per kilogram dosage.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.160]   In any event, the point is that many of the studies
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.260]   that describe these pretty dramatic structural changes
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.240]   in the animal brain, most typically the mouse brain
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.560]   in response to psilocybin,
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.400]   used dosages of psilocybin that if translated to humans
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.400]   would be about double the human therapeutic dose.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.700]   So that is something that we need to take
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.880]   into consideration.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.220]   Nonetheless, it's very clear that in both animal studies
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.380]   and humans, psilocybin is inducing both structural
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:33.600]   and functional changes in brain circuitry.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.640]   And that in humans, the network connectivity
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.840]   is being changed dramatically.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.680]   We talked about those data earlier
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.480]   and that the underlying basis for that might be,
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.820]   again, might be, we don't know for sure,
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.620]   the addition of new dendritic spines on these pyramidal
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.600]   neurons that we've been talking about repeatedly
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:50.660]   throughout today's episode.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.340]   Although neurogenesis, perhaps,
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.880]   and other modes of neuroplasticity,
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.760]   such as the elimination of certain connections,
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.980]   perhaps related to unhealthy maladaptive thoughts
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.420]   or our feeling that a particular sad song
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.100]   is overwhelmingly sad.
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.360]   It could be the case that those sorts of things
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.340]   change subjectively because of the removal
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.180]   of neural connections.
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.060]   If you're going to think like a neurobiologist
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.360]   or scientist for that matter,
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.480]   you don't ever want to think that one mechanism
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.280]   can explain all the effects of a given drug
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.560]   or a given experiences.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.240]   Almost certainly likely to be the consequence
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.280]   of multiple mechanisms acting in parallel.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.800]   And because I know there are people out there
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.880]   who would like to know even more about the neuroplasticity
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:32.060]   induced by psychedelics, including psilocybin,
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.160]   there's a wonderful review that I provide a link to
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.000]   in the show note captions entitled,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.600]   Psychedelics and Neuroplasticity,
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.920]   a Systematic Review Unraveling the Biological
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.240]   Underpinnings of Psychedelics.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.940]   This review is great because it goes a step beyond
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.240]   just psilocybin, psilocin binding
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.260]   to the serotonin 2A receptor
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.360]   and things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.400]   It actually talks a lot about the intracellular signaling
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.480]   and exactly how neurons change their excitability patterns
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:00.400]   based on this activation of the serotonin 2A receptor.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.400]   It's probably more detailed than most of you out there
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.640]   are interested in, but if you are interested
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.780]   in that level of detail,
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.140]   this is a wonderful open access review.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:08.980]   So a few minutes ago,
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:12.200]   I talked about where there is strong, modest,
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.300]   and somewhat weak, or rather I should say minimal evidence
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.700]   for the therapeutic use of psilocybin
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:19.900]   to treat various disorders.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.220]   And across the board, it really appears
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:27.220]   that major depression and so-called intractable depression
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.460]   in some cases is where we're seeing
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:32.220]   the most exciting research to date.
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.620]   Now keep in mind that because of the Controlled Substances
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.700]   Act being invoked in 1970 in the United States,
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.420]   and because it was only just a few years ago, really,
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.300]   only about five years ago,
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.520]   that psychedelics, including psilocybin,
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.340]   received what's called breakthrough status at the FDA,
[01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:51.220]   that there are now a lot of clinical trials
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.300]   exploring how psilocybin can impact various things
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.260]   like mood disorders, addictive disorders, and so on.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.980]   Prior to 2018, when that therapeutic breakthrough potential
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:03.060]   was established in the United States,
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.060]   I think a lot of people
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:06.580]   in the so-called psychedelics community had the sense
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:09.020]   and really the belief that these drugs
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:10.700]   had enormous potential,
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.660]   but they just weren't being explored that extensively.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:17.100]   So I do want to give a nod to the incredible researchers,
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:20.140]   such as Robin Cardart-Harris, but also Matthew Johnson,
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:23.760]   Roland Griffiths, Nolan Williams, and many others.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:26.260]   Okay, I'm certainly not listing off everybody.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.500]   That would take hours.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.060]   But those researchers have really pioneered
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.240]   both the legal efforts and the funding efforts,
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.060]   and most importantly, the research efforts
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.140]   defining the clinical data that I'm about to describe.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.740]   And here, I'm going to summarize the clinical data
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.740]   in a bit of a top contour fashion,
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.940]   just giving you the kind of highlights.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.900]   We will, of course, provide links to the papers
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.540]   if you'd like to look into it further.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.540]   But I'm only giving you the top contour
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.140]   because I've had the great fortune
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.300]   of having Matthew Johnson on this podcast before.
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:57.420]   You can find that episode at HubermanLab.com.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.740]   Just simply put Matt's name or psychedelics
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.740]   into the search function.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:03.380]   It'll take you to that episode in all formats,
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:05.480]   or links to all formats, rather.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.500]   I've also had the great fortune of sitting down recently
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.740]   with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris to talk about his work
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.860]   at University of California, San Francisco
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.260]   on psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, and DMT
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.940]   as it relates to depression and other disorders.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.380]   And that episode, which also will be released
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.680]   at HubermanLab.com and on all platforms,
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:25.700]   YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.420]   really goes in depth into these clinical studies
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.460]   and what those studies really look like.
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.980]   Who's in the room?
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.820]   Whether or not people just get one dose or two doses,
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.320]   how far apart those are separated,
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:39.660]   all of that is covered in extensive detail
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.440]   in that what I found to be wonderful discussion
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.060]   with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.020]   So if you're interested in all of the details
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.960]   as it relates to clinical application of psychedelics,
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.020]   stay tuned for that episode soon.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.260]   Again, you can find that at HubermanLab.com
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.140]   and on all platforms.
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.100]   In the meantime, I would be remiss
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.740]   if I didn't include a bit of discussion
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.780]   about what has been observed
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.360]   in terms of using psilocybin journeys
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.260]   as a way to treat depression,
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:09.700]   because the data are just oh so exciting.
[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:12.460]   Again, these data really started to surface
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.360]   as the consequence of studies that were initiated
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.240]   around 2006 in just a few select laboratories,
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.140]   and then really picked up
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.880]   in terms of the number of laboratories
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:26.600]   and number of studies between 2018 and now.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.460]   So what you'll notice is that most of the papers
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.260]   I'm about to describe were published in,
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:32.300]   for instance, phenomenal journals,
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:36.260]   New England Journal of Medicine in 2021,
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.960]   New England Journal of Medicine, November, 2022,
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:44.180]   Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.740]   just very recently, 2021.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.340]   So these are very recent papers.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:50.460]   Essentially, all of these clinical studies
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:55.460]   involve either one or two psilocybin sessions.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:58.980]   The dosages that were explored range from zero milligrams,
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:02.420]   so placebo, if you will, 10 milligrams,
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:06.580]   some cases 25 milligrams, in some cases 30 milligrams.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:10.360]   And most typically, people received the same dosage
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.880]   for both sessions if indeed they did both sessions.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.020]   However, there's at least one study
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.280]   looking at just one single episode
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:19.780]   of psilocybin administration.
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:21.780]   So this is the paper entitled, no surprise,
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:24.340]   single dose psilocybin for treatment resistant episode
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:25.500]   of major depression.
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.540]   This was published in the New England Journal of Medicine
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.060]   November of 2022.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:31.780]   I'll just summarize the results
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:34.900]   of this single application study.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.180]   They randomly assigned subjects
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.660]   who had treatment resistant depression,
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:40.200]   so they'd resisted treatment to other things,
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:41.440]   to receive a single dose
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.660]   of a synthetic formulation of psilocybin.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.860]   So they're not eating mushrooms,
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.900]   they're getting a synthetic dose of psilocybin,
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.620]   but the dose is known of either 25 milligrams,
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:55.460]   10 milligrams, or one milligram, which was the control.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:57.540]   And they received psychological support.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.740]   There were a number of different tests,
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.340]   subjective tests of depression,
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:05.560]   taken before and after the psilocybin journey.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.400]   They had about 75 to 79 participants in each group,
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.500]   again, at the three different doses,
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.480]   25, 10 or one milligram.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:16.980]   And they looked at the changes in these scores,
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.480]   these depression related scores on these tests.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.640]   There are many results from this paper one could summarize,
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:22.860]   but among the most important results
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.140]   I can summarize from the discussion,
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.580]   and here I'm paraphrasing that the change in baseline
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.580]   levels of depression that is,
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.940]   at week three, following the psilocybin session,
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:34.240]   was significantly better,
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.440]   that is people experienced more relief,
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.260]   or more people experienced more relief,
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:43.380]   from the 25 milligram dose than from the one milligram dose.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:44.620]   And this is important,
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.420]   there was no significant difference
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:49.420]   between the 10 milligram dose and the one milligram dose.
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:51.640]   This really points to the fact
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:54.520]   that the 25 to 30 milligram dose that's used
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.280]   in the largest numbers of studies
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.560]   exploring treatment resistant depression,
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.240]   really seems to be, I don't want to say the best dose,
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.840]   but the most effective dose,
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:05.400]   at least in this clinical context,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.940]   in this set and setting,
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.880]   and with this particular patient population.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.800]   So we want to be careful to say that,
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.280]   so that one doesn't just translate the 25 milligrams
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.760]   is better than 10 milligrams,
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.600]   although in this study,
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:18.740]   it was for sake of treatment resistant depression relief.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:23.340]   There were a number of other key aspects of this paper,
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.300]   in particular, the exploration of so-called adverse events.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:29.320]   So things like headaches, propensity for self-harm,
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:33.440]   actual self-harm, anxiety, and so on.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.880]   It's worth mentioning that there were adverse events
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:38.740]   in essentially every group.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:42.180]   The number of adverse events was highest
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:44.220]   in the 25 milligram dose group.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:46.400]   This is observed in other studies as well.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.840]   With higher dosages, there tends to be greater relief
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.080]   from depressive symptoms,
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.620]   but also a greater chance for adverse events.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:58.080]   Some of those adverse events can be quite severe,
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.720]   so feelings of suicidal ideation, et cetera.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:03.440]   Some of them, one could consider a little less severe,
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.520]   mild headache, or severe headache that was transient,
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.940]   or anxiety that was transient.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.840]   Again, highly individual responses.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.280]   We could go line by line and table by table
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:15.980]   through this paper, which we won't,
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:17.500]   because there's a lot of data.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.940]   Again, we'll provide a link to this paper
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:20.740]   if you'd like to peruse it yourself.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:22.320]   It's fairly straightforward to read.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.720]   That's one thing that's nice about these clinical trials
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.400]   is they tend to be written in fairly non-technical language,
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:29.660]   although there's a little bit of technical language.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.240]   The important point is that a single dose
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.440]   of 25 milligrams of psilocybin provided significant relief
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.280]   from treatment of resistant depression
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:39.080]   in this particular patient population.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.620]   But it is not the case that 100% of the people
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.840]   who took 25 milligrams of psilocybin
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.680]   experienced that relief.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.200]   However, the majority of them did.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:48.720]   Now, when you say majority in science,
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.440]   you really need to look to numbers.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.260]   And the reason I'm not telling you,
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.420]   oh, it was 75% or 60% or 50%
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:57.720]   is because it depends on which time point
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.360]   people were analyzed.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.700]   People were asked about their level of depression relief
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.580]   immediately after, one week after, two weeks after,
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:07.320]   three weeks after.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.300]   And the degree of relief tended to change over time.
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.080]   In fact, it tended to diminish over time,
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:15.860]   but it was also stable, or remarkably stable, I should say,
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.420]   at least by my read,
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:20.200]   in the 25 milligram dose group.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.460]   And that is summarized nicely in figure two of the paper,
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.080]   because they explored these people's levels of depression
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.140]   out to week 12,
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:32.280]   and they still saw a significant degree of depression relief
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.700]   12 weeks after the single 25 milligram
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:37.680]   psilocybin dose session.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.980]   So as I mentioned earlier,
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:42.020]   there are now about a dozen or so excellent studies,
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:44.760]   clinical trials exploring the use of single
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.260]   or two-session psilocybin treatment
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:50.140]   in that 25 to 30 milligram range,
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:52.380]   which seems to be the most effective dose
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.740]   for long-lasting relief from depression.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:59.080]   Each one of those studies explored something different,
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.180]   as is important.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.980]   Replication is also important, of course,
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.200]   in order to validate previous studies.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:08.060]   But for instance, there have been comparisons of psilocybin
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:11.140]   versus SSRIs or other antidepressants.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:13.280]   There have been comparisons of psilocybin
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.240]   plus psychoanalysis or cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.340]   versus cognitive behavioral therapy alone
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.980]   or psychoanalysis alone.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.240]   And so there's a lot of evaluation now
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.040]   of the clinical outcomes and the statistical outcomes
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.940]   of these subjective measures
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.740]   and even some objective measures of neurochemistry
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:35.100]   where that's possible in terms of trying to understand
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.440]   if and how psilocybin is effective
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.880]   for the treatment of depression.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.460]   And the major takeaway is that,
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.080]   indeed, it does seem to be the case.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.420]   And the numbers that I feel comfortable
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:46.540]   not throwing out there but putting out to you
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:49.220]   reflect my conversation with Robin Cardhart-Harris.
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:52.800]   Again, that will be released soon at hubermanlab.com,
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.060]   as well as takeaways from what I would say
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:59.480]   are the six broadest studies,
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:02.460]   meaning they have the widest range of age groups,
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:05.720]   the broadest demographic in terms of the subjects,
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.300]   their backgrounds, their levels of education,
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.940]   men, women, ethnicity, et cetera.
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:13.380]   And a lot of that can be summarized
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.900]   in the paper entitled "Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.360]   "on Major Depressive Disorder."
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:20.480]   This was a particular randomized clinical trial.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.620]   But in the discussion, I think they summarize it quite well,
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.560]   which is that if you look at the number of people
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:31.820]   who take this 25 milligram dose twice
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:34.760]   in sessions spaced about a week apart,
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:39.580]   what you will find is that anywhere from 60 to 75%
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:42.420]   of the people who have major depressive disorder
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:44.820]   who do these psilocybin sessions in the proper setting,
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:46.880]   report a good experience with it,
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.540]   have minimal adverse events coming out of those sessions,
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.900]   and in the weeks following,
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:57.780]   those people experience substantial positive relief
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.740]   from major depression in ways that other treatments
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:04.900]   that they've explored, including antidepressant drugs,
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.620]   cognitive behavioral therapy, and other types of therapy
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.540]   alone could not provide.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:12.580]   Now, it's a general feature of these clinical trials
[01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:14.540]   focusing on psilocybin that people are asked
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:16.300]   to stop taking their antidepressants
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:18.300]   prior to participating in the trial.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:21.100]   It's also a general feature of these trials
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:24.300]   that people are encouraged to not suddenly start
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:27.220]   their antidepressant treatment immediately afterwards,
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.020]   because of course that could confound the results
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.420]   of the psilocybin treatment.
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.120]   However, and this is a very important thing to note,
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:36.260]   all subjects were encouraged not to avoid
[01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:38.900]   taking those antidepressant medications
[01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:42.020]   if in fact their clinician felt that it was important
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:44.460]   for their immediate and long-term survival.
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:47.060]   So no one should be reckless in thinking about
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:51.020]   what to add or delete from their drug protocol
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:52.480]   when dealing with depression, right?
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.460]   The outcomes could be very severe in that case.
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:58.820]   Nonetheless, we can paraphrase from the discussion
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.000]   of the paper I just mentioned,
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.060]   because it really highlights the incredible results
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:05.700]   that psilocybin applied in these particular
[02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.800]   therapeutic settings are providing.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.860]   And here again, I'm paraphrasing.
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:12.300]   The present trial showed that psilocybin administered
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.520]   in the context of supportive psychotherapy,
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:18.920]   consisting of approximately 11 hours of psychotherapy,
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.940]   so this is going to be two sessions of the psilocybin
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:25.460]   with proper therapeutic support,
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:28.580]   produced large rapid and sustained antidepressant effects.
[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:30.260]   The effect sizes reported in the study
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:33.060]   were approximately 2.5 times greater
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:36.080]   than the effects sizes found in psychotherapy.
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.520]   And more than four times greater than the effect sizes
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.940]   found in psychopharmacologic depression treatment studies.
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.200]   In other words, four times the positive effect
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.980]   observed with typical SSRIs
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.540]   or other pharmacology of that sort.
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:53.360]   These findings are consistent with the literature
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:56.300]   that showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:57.760]   were more efficacious in the treatment
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:01.300]   of major depressive disorder than either intervention alone.
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:04.020]   So again, this points to the fact that combining
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:07.880]   drug therapy with talk therapy, as it's often called,
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.340]   is going to be more effective than either treatment alone.
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:12.940]   Here are the drug therapy, psilocybin therapy.
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:15.440]   And again, please don't take the fact that in these studies,
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.140]   they tended to ask people to not take
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.580]   their antidepressant medication heading into the study
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.000]   as a sign that one should stop taking
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.180]   their antidepressant medication.
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.820]   Rather, I think this study and other studies like it,
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:27.520]   again, which we'll provide links to in the show note
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.020]   captions that are discussed extensively in the episode
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:32.460]   with Dr. Cardart-Harris soon to come,
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:36.860]   really point to the incredible role that psilocybin can have
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:40.460]   in creating an experience inside of the session,
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.060]   the journey or the trip, as it's called,
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.860]   as well as initiating neuroplastic events,
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.300]   perhaps the addition of dendritic spines,
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.620]   maybe even some new neurons, maybe,
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:52.120]   although I don't think that's the predominant mode,
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.660]   but that leads to these more extensive connectivities
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:58.900]   in the brain, the so-called reduction in modular networks,
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.460]   enhanced activity in brain areas that normally
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:03.620]   wouldn't be talking to one another,
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:06.360]   but not doing that in any kind of haphazard way.
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:08.780]   It really does seem that the one or two sessions
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:13.140]   of psilocybin that induce these feelings of ego dissolution,
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.780]   that induce these feelings of oceanic boundlessness, right?
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.300]   So mystical, right?
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.540]   And in many ways, it's what I find so incredible
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.100]   about psilocybin and other psychedelics
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:26.660]   is that despite the highly mystical, highly subjective,
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:31.220]   and still at this time, somewhat top contour understanding
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:34.120]   of how they might exert their effects,
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.660]   you can highlight boldface and underline might there, right?
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:38.920]   Because it hasn't really been firmly established
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.480]   what the exact cell biological rewiring events are,
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.760]   but there is now what I would refer to
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.140]   as a center of mass of data that point to the fact
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:49.900]   that psilocybin, when taken in the appropriate set
[02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:52.740]   and setting, the appropriate dosages,
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:55.220]   can invoke the sorts of neuroplasticity
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:59.320]   and changes in emotionality, in perceptual experience,
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.220]   not just during the psychedelic session,
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:04.260]   but for long periods of time after the psychedelic session
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:06.660]   that can provide really remarkable relief
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:08.220]   from things like major depression
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:11.140]   and perhaps other psychiatric issues as well.
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:13.260]   And of course, I realize that many of you are listening to
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:14.620]   and are watching this episode
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:16.220]   and you're not necessarily depressed
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:18.700]   or thinking about psychedelics like psilocybin
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.380]   in the context of depression.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:22.860]   I hope today's discussion allowed you to better understand
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:26.300]   how psychedelics and psilocybin in particular,
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.420]   because that's what we've been talking about,
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.240]   are able to exert these incredible effects
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.500]   that they seem to exert.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:34.840]   This is not a call for everyone to run out
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.800]   and do psilocybin, it is absolutely not that.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:41.100]   It is, however, my attempt to really put a magnifying lens
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:43.180]   on this incredible area of research that's happening,
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.300]   not just in the context of clinical trials,
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:49.120]   but in the context of trying to understand how serotonin
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.860]   and how drugs like psilocybin,
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.680]   which in many ways mimics serotonin,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.440]   and more particularly the activation of particular receptors
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.320]   in the brain, like the serotonin 2A receptor.
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.980]   I mean, just sit back and think about that.
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:01.420]   The selective activation of this receptor,
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:04.780]   which is, by the way, associated with the expansion
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:07.140]   of the neocortex across evolution,
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:09.820]   didn't mention that before, but indeed it is,
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:12.780]   how that can lead to enhanced ways of thinking,
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:14.180]   changed ways of thinking,
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.820]   actual learning inside of this short four-hour
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:21.160]   or six-hour session that we call the psilocybin journey.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.460]   So as is often the case, perhaps as is always the case
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.060]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:28.120]   we did a deep dive into a topic today,
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.560]   into the topic of psilocybin, what it is, how it works,
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.260]   the different ways in which it changes brain circuitry,
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:38.060]   how it creates the experiences that we think of
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:41.760]   as the psilocybin journey, what the safety issues are,
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:43.900]   what the so-called set and setting are
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.100]   that can lend themselves to positive therapeutic outcomes.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:47.940]   And in doing so,
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:49.560]   my goal was really to highlight several things.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.980]   First of all, I am very excited
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:55.940]   about the potential for psychedelics such as psilocybin
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:58.140]   to provide relief for mental health issues
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:01.660]   that to date have been very hard for people to access.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.700]   In addition to that,
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:05.020]   I'm just fundamentally interested in the brain
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:06.780]   and how it works and how it can change
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:08.540]   this thing we call neuroplasticity.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:11.380]   To me, neuroplasticity is the holy grail
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:13.240]   of the human nervous system.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.500]   As far as we know, we are the animal
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.980]   that can have long-lasting neuroplasticity
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:19.540]   throughout the lifespan.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:22.380]   And if it requires the use of compounds
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:24.960]   in a safe and controlled way, such as psilocybin,
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.240]   in order to achieve maximal plasticity
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:29.380]   in a short amount of time, that's exciting.
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:31.420]   But of course, that also needs to be considered
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:33.540]   with all of the safety precautions in mind
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:34.420]   that we talked about earlier,
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:38.340]   including the fact that people who have a predisposition
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.500]   or who have psychosis or bipolar disorder
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.980]   or a relative that has psychosis or bipolar disorder,
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:48.180]   younger people, meaning people 25 years of age and younger,
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.780]   and really anyone who's not working with a dedicated
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.420]   and highly trained physician
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:54.540]   needs to be very cautious about these compounds as well.
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:55.840]   They're very exciting.
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.300]   I think psilocybin is an exciting
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.140]   and super interesting compound
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:00.620]   for basic and clinical reasons
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.120]   and for other reasons as well.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.180]   But they are sharp blades, as we say.
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:07.420]   And with sharp blades, you can do incredible things,
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.820]   but you can also cut yourself very badly.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:12.440]   So all those considerations need to be taken to mind.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.220]   So I consider the science and use of psilocybin
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:18.820]   to be an exciting but still preliminary area
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:21.900]   that I certainly am paying a lot of attention to
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.860]   and I know there's a lot of excitement about.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:25.180]   So stay tuned for the episode
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:26.940]   with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris,
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.880]   and we will probably revisit psilocybin,
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:31.580]   and we will certainly revisit the other psychedelics
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.140]   and non-classical psychedelics,
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:38.140]   including LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, ketamine, MDMA, mescaline,
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:42.420]   and all the rest in future episodes as well.

[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.900]   Not so much during today's episode,
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.280]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:19.380]   we talk about supplements.
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:21.540]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.600]   many people do derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:25.360]   for things like enhancing the quality
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:26.740]   and duration of their sleep,
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:27.960]   for things like improving focus,
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.680]   and for hormone augmentation, and much more.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:32.560]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered

[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:34.960]   And on all those places,
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:37.260]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.800]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.380]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:42.240]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.000]   covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.820]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:48.740]   Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:51.080]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:52.760]   all about psilocybin.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.020]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:56.900]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:59.480]   [upbeat music]
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.060]   (upbeat music)
