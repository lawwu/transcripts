[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   About once a week or so I get an email from a listener that goes something like this.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.840]   "Joshua, what do you think about net work marketing, aka multi-level marketing?
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.440]   Is it a great business opportunity or should I be careful?"
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:07.000]   Today let's tackle this minefield.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.640]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.560]   Today let's tackle this very important question because done right, network marketing could
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.040]   be very profitable.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:39.280]   Done wrong, it could cause major problems.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.640]   Network marketing is one of those things where it's increasingly hard for me to believe that
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.560]   we haven't, all of us, had at least some exposure to it.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.400]   What I have found is that many people that I've interacted with, usually if we look back
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.120]   and start counting, we can find a couple of network marketing experiences in our history.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   I know for me, I've been involved in at least three of them that I can, maybe two or three
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620]   of them that I can think of.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.680]   In high school I got involved with one that featured selling discounted plans for dental
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.000]   expenses.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   This was a little bit of an ironic exposure, early exposure to the world of health expenses,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   which I later went into the health insurance business with.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.460]   I was involved in a nutritional supplement company that many members of my family were
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.460]   involved in.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.840]   I had a family member that was involved in a company that made air purifiers.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.480]   My grandmother was involved with the granddaddy of all network marketing companies, the one
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.360]   that sells – my mom always used SA8 as her laundry soap for years and years.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   What else?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.040]   If I went back through, I had a family member that was involved in a decorating network
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.800]   marketing company, involved in demonstrating or putting up decorating materials for home
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   decorations.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.360]   I've been to parties for the home goods suppliers that sell that.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.480]   My wife recently went to a party for the company that does – manufactures silver-infused
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   cleaning materials.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What else?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.140]   There are so many interesting oddball little companies.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.480]   So I've got a good amount of experience with network marketing, but I've also done
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.120]   a lot of research on the subject.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.920]   I was heavily recruited by a company that uses the network marketing approach to sell
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.640]   insurance products and investment products.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.120]   In fact, I even maintain a short mental list of a couple of companies that are kind of
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.360]   backups of backups.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.080]   If all of my business ideas failed, if all my plans failed and I needed to create money,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.800]   if I didn't have a job, I have a couple of short companies that I've come across
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.200]   that I would keep on my list of – that are on my list of opportunities that I would personally
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.160]   consider pursuing as a way to provide for my financial needs and the financial needs
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.420]   of my family.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.160]   So I have a deep appreciation for network marketing companies.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   I also have a deep suspicion of that network marketing arrangement.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.880]   So let's explain, starting with a discussion of what is network marketing.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.640]   I'll usually use this term.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   Network marketing could also be used multi-level marketing.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   Both of those words are charitable and I think accurate.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.540]   However, there are other terms.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.860]   For example, people often allege that network marketing companies and organizations are
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.660]   pyramid schemes.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.940]   Or of course, if you get to the word of pyramid scheme, quickly people will get to the question
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.220]   of a Ponzi scheme.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.420]   So what are these things?
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.100]   Well, a network marketing company is relatively simple.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.100]   You sign up with a company as a distributor.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.420]   Names of course will vary with the company.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.940]   But in essence, a distributor license gives you a dealership license, gives you the ability
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.540]   to represent that company's products to other people.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.740]   Usually you're going to be representing that company's products to people that you
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.980]   know, people within your network.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.900]   That's why it's called network marketing.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.020]   The idea is if you find a product or service that you love, then why wouldn't you want
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.180]   to tell your friends about it?
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.020]   If they love it and they buy some products or services from you, then why should you
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.580]   not earn a commission on it?
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.540]   That's the basic idea of network marketing.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.460]   Now network marketing would be very simple if it were kept purely in the realm of marketing
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.340]   products or services to your network.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.920]   However, let's move into the term multi-level marketing.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.860]   This term connotes the idea that you can bring other people in underneath you as a level
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.700]   under you.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.420]   And if you are selling products to your friends and you're earning a commission on that,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.060]   what about the idea of getting your friends to sell products to their friends, to the
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.780]   second level of the network?
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.180]   Why not sign them up to represent the products?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.300]   And if you've gotten them to sell the products to their friends, then wouldn't it be cool
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.580]   if you could also get a commission on their sales activity?
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.060]   And so that's where we start to get into levels of marketing, the idea here of a multi-level
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.180]   marketing organization.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.500]   Picture in your mind a pyramid and you at the very top of the pyramid are the first
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.100]   – you're the first person.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.700]   Can you underneath you recruit a couple of other people to sell this company's products
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.200]   or services?
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.840]   And then what if you can help and encourage them to recruit some other people to also
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.580]   sell this company's products or services?
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.260]   Well why not share in the commissions from the levels below you?
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.620]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.460]   So this is where we get the term multi-level marketing.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.200]   However, notice I've brought in the word pyramid.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.860]   What is a pyramid scheme?
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.000]   The idea here in a pyramid scheme – and this is where we start to get from accurate
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.420]   to possibly accurate but probably uncharitable at the very least.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.140]   An uncharitable term to use, a pyramid scheme or a pyramid scam if some people would call
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.900]   it is where you are involved in getting other people to sign up under you and they're
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.180]   involved in getting other people to sign up under them and they're involved in getting
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.260]   other people to sign up under them and everybody is making all down the road – money all
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.960]   down the line from all the people that are under them.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.020]   So where does it become a scam?
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.300]   The answer is very simple.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.140]   It becomes a scam when products aren't being sold, just distributorships.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.040]   And this cutting right to the chase is I believe the most important thing that you should keep
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.220]   in mind when you are looking at a business opportunity that is functioning according
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.740]   to this network marketing or multilevel marketing approach.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.180]   Are products being sold or are business opportunities being sold?
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.100]   If business opportunities are being sold, we start to get into the – primarily, we
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:18.560]   start to get into the questionable area where it's questionably ethical, which brings
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.580]   me to the final term I brought in which is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.340]   The Ponzi scheme is an investment scheme where somebody comes in and recruits investors to
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.260]   chip in a little bit of money for a great return.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.920]   Then they use that money and they go and recruit other investors and then they use the money
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.740]   from the second line of investors to recompensate the first line of investors and they keep
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.620]   on doing this down the line, down the line, down the line.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.460]   But the problem is there's never an investment actually being made.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.780]   And so ultimately, the Ponzi scheme collapses and there have been many network marketing
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:56.300]   organizations over the years that have collapsed because at the end of the day, very few products
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.380]   were ever actually being sold and consumed and seemingly the only people that really
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:06.620]   got rich were the people who were in at the beginning, who had the biggest networks underneath
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.220]   them.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.980]   So now that you understand these terms, I think you should look at opportunities that
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:22.020]   you see and ask yourself the question, "What type of opportunity is this?
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.940]   Is this a network marketing/multilevel marketing opportunity or is this going over in the direction
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.760]   of a pyramid scheme?"
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.660]   Now in a moment, I'll talk about the benefits and drawbacks of multilevel marketing opportunities.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.540]   But I want to lead with the most important factor which is this.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:44.260]   You have to ask the question, "Are products being sold?"
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:52.900]   And is the bulk of the emphasis that you are hearing in the sales presentation, in the
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:10:01.740]   training, etc. on the sale of products or on the recruitment of salespeople?
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.380]   I believe that both are legitimate activities.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:13.340]   The whole concept of a pyramid structure of a company wherein people at the top earn income
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:20.060]   from those who are underneath them and reporting to them is the way that most companies work
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.860]   including any company that I've ever been involved in.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.740]   If I'm the owner and founder of a company, I go and I have a product or service that
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.380]   I'm trying to get to the marketplace.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:37.420]   I hire employees underneath me and those employees earn wages for their own activities and then
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.540]   I take the excess profit that I get from the sale of the product or service minus the wages
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.420]   that they get and I get to keep that as profit.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.780]   Now it's a little bit more – it's a little bit not as direct as it is in a sales organization
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.620]   as it is in most companies.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.560]   But this is traditionally the way that sales organizations work.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.580]   For example, the life insurance industry from where I came professionally, the life insurance
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.940]   industry has worked on this principle for a very long time.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:13.500]   Generally a life insurance company will grant to an employee or an agent something that's
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.420]   called a general agency contract.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.580]   They'll grant a geographic – an exclusive geographic contract to a person called the
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.260]   general agent.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.060]   This general agent contract stipulates that the person who's signing up as a general
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.540]   agent has the exclusive right to market this company's products or services within a
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.160]   geographic area.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.680]   They also have a duty to actually effectively market that company's products or services
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.700]   or the contract will be canceled.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.540]   The general agent can then go out and recruit – excuse me, and the general agent, the
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.180]   first person, the general agent will, based upon the amount of products sold within their
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:58.460]   geographic area, they will receive their compensation on a commission rate, a generalized commission
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460]   rate for all of the products that are sold in the general area.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.540]   But the general agent doesn't go out and do all the selling themselves.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.300]   What they do is they recruit people who are called district agents.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:16.100]   So a district agent is also somebody who usually has a geographic – an exclusive geographic
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.100]   contract.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.780]   I'm just speaking here specifically to the life insurance business.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.260]   That district agent is given a smaller geographic agent.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.940]   The district agent has a duty to develop a sales force of life insurance agents within
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.060]   that geographic area and to report back up to the general agent.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:41.220]   And then the district agent goes and they will recruit life insurance agents and they'll
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.180]   also put in place a management structure of some kind over those life insurance agents.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.580]   The names for the contracts will vary.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.260]   But usually, you'll have a sales manager structure of some kind and you'll have a
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.140]   producer structure.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.820]   Ultimately, most of the production will fall on the actual producer, the life insurance
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.740]   agent, individual life insurance agent out in the field selling something like a life
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.440]   insurance contract.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.580]   But all up the way, as they are productive, the life insurance agent will earn a commission.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.020]   Their sales manager will earn a commission.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.680]   The district agent will earn a commission and the general agent will earn a commission.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.260]   But all along the way, each of those people, the general agent, the district agent, and
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:30.740]   the sales manager all produce service or facilities of some kind to help the life insurance agent
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.100]   do their job.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.880]   All they provide is an opportunity, an opportunity for the agent to go out and make a living.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.740]   But they simply provide training and support of various kinds.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.260]   And it's up to them to figure out what's the best way to do it.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.300]   So this structure has been around for a very long time.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.860]   And I don't see anything wrong with that structure from an ethical or moral basis.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.780]   I see nothing wrong with that structure.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:02.040]   It's a voluntary association between free people who are voluntarily entering into this
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.460]   contractual arrangement with one another.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.720]   Nobody is being forced to do anything.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.100]   And at any point in time, the marketplace will offer competitive opportunities for them
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.900]   to go and do other types of work, for them to go and work with other people, other companies,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.900]   et cetera.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.780]   So I see nothing morally and ethically wrong with this pyramid approach.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.660]   This is one of the standard complaints that's lodged against network marketing companies.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.260]   I don't see anything wrong with it.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.760]   That said, there are a couple of problems that need to be looked out for.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:41.660]   Number one, is the management and leadership structure actually providing value for the
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.740]   individual agent at the bottom?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.940]   And that's one thing that's unique about the life insurance industry is that those general
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.720]   agents and district agents and sales managers, they have to provide value.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.240]   If they don't, number one, they're going to lose the agent because the agent is going
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.800]   to fail.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   And if they're not providing value, then ultimately the company, the life insurance
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.440]   company whose products are being represented is going to say, "This is a very inefficient
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.000]   form of sales.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.120]   Let's go and find another sales structure.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.160]   Let's go direct to the consumer."
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.440]   And many insurance companies have done this and have tried it.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:25.200]   The most unique area is where direct to consumer hasn't generally worked has been life insurance.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.840]   You could compare here something like automobile insurance, Geico.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.600]   When Geico is marketing with their cheesy little commercials all over the place, they're
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.560]   not telling you to call a Geico insurance agent even though that's what you're actually
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.360]   doing when you call Geico.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.160]   They're telling you to call Geico.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.200]   What they've done is they've built a direct to consumer pipeline where if you want car
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.840]   insurance you go right to Geico.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.360]   That's different than another company that has a local agency right there in your town,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.800]   maybe a company like a state farm where they have a local insurance office.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.320]   And generally you expect to go into the local insurance office to work with the insurance
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.680]   agent to work out the things that you need.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   What companies have found in the areas of life insurance is that although direct to
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.720]   consumer marketing is possible, you see ads on cable TV, et cetera, for life insurance
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.200]   sales, generally most people don't on their own decide, "I'm going to go out and buy life
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   insurance."
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.680]   Life insurance is not required by law and it generally will involve the salesmanship
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.280]   of an insurance agent to convince people of the value of life insurance that they'll buy.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.140]   So life insurance companies continually find that this agency system provides enough value
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.000]   for them to sell their products at an acceptable rate.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.240]   So the system has to bring value.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.880]   But if there's too much taking and not enough producing, then it will collapse.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.280]   And this unfortunately is what has happened and is happening and will happen with many
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.160]   multi-level and network marketing companies.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.400]   And I think you should steer clear of a company or organization that is built primarily on
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.300]   recruitment and not on the sale of product.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:12.120]   Because fundamentally the company that's offering the distributorship has to be selling product.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.680]   Nothing is happening until product is being sold.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.240]   If all that is being sold is business opportunity and no product is actually moving, then we've
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.660]   got a problem.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.000]   That company will in time collapse because there's no value being brought.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.680]   Now, the couple of things you want to be careful of, some network marketing companies will
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.700]   sell product packaged up with the business opportunity and they'll do it either in an
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.860]   ethical way or in an unethical way.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:45.100]   For example, I have a family member who's involved in a company where their distributorship
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.960]   license is based around the sale of a small kit of the company's products.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.820]   Well, in that situation, if you buy that complete kit, you have an opportunity to go ahead and
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.200]   order at a wholesale level.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.960]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.120]   And you have to be careful with the nothing wrong with that.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.280]   It's a reasonable enough cost to mean that it's not a huge problem.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   However, some companies have had such massive amounts of minimum product orders that they
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.040]   expected that it's really caused significant problems and it's gone into a very shady gray
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.160]   area where – can you make the argument?
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.760]   Well, it was done openly and ethically, volunteer exchange between two people.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.560]   I think you can make that argument.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.200]   But with all the information fully understood, it just feels pretty slimy.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.520]   You wouldn't want to be involved in it.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.560]   So this is where the reputation of people having thousands of dollars worth of product
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.760]   in their garage has come from.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.280]   So be careful.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:49.240]   My litmus test for whether you should pursue an opportunity or not is based around product
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.000]   sales.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.440]   Is the product being sold?
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:01.500]   Now, product can be sold and people can also work on a recruitment.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.920]   But you have to recognize that recruitment is in many ways much more difficult and requires
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.040]   much more work than the sale of the product.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.000]   There's a very small subset of people who are going to be very good at recruitment and
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.280]   very good at training a sales organization.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.760]   This is where a lot of the network marketing companies break down because everybody is
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.720]   recruited.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.800]   Then it leads to very sloppy, very difficult sales organizations.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.880]   Another white line test that you want to look for is how far down does the compensation
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   go?
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.600]   In the example that I illustrated from the venerable life insurance profession, you notice
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.440]   that you had a few structures, a few levels of compensation.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.960]   But ultimately, that level of compensation in my example was capped out at about four
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.600]   – general agent, district agent, sales manager, and company.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.040]   So actually three levels there – sales manager, district agent, and general agent.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:03.920]   That is a supportable structure where you have a few layers of incentive compensation
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.040]   built.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.120]   But if you were to go much beyond that number – and I don't know the specific number,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.400]   maybe three, four, five, six, I don't know.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:20.520]   But if I came across a company that was offering compensation on an unlimited number of people
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.240]   underneath me, there's just no way to support that much money.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.520]   There's no way that you can earn all down the road, down the line.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.300]   So if I came across a company like that, I would turn and run for the hills just because
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.800]   there's no way for it to continue.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.720]   If you get to a point where you have an excessive number of levels, this should also be a major
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.880]   red flag.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   What number is excessive?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   I don't know.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.960]   I didn't research prior to this show to see if even there are regulation in this industry
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.320]   now as far as how many levels.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.360]   But I mean to me, ten feels excessive.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.940]   Five feels – okay, I could see that supported.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.360]   But much beyond five, I would start getting a little bit nervous.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.260]   The fundamental trouble with a lot of network marketing companies is because you're often
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.960]   selling such niche products, there's just not a lot of business that's going to be
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.800]   done with the average normal person.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.600]   If you're selling a health supplement, are most people going to buy a health supplement
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.920]   that's in excess of – under $50 a month?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.760]   Well, your commission rate on $50 a month is going to be pretty small.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.840]   Now if you set it up on an ongoing basis and they order every month and let's say that
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.120]   you're paid a $10 commission out of their $50 order, you get enough of those people
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.440]   signed up and you can have a really nice residual income, which is the big attraction of network
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.680]   marketing, that can work.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.940]   But that's going to be a lot of work.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.720]   The big thing to watch out for also is those big packages though because what can happen
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.800]   is if you are incentivized with a commission rate that is – let's be conservative.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.480]   Let's say it's 10 percent of the product sale.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:02.060]   If you can get somebody to buy a $500 distributorship package versus a $50 initial monthly order,
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.000]   you're going to be much more incentivized to sell that $500 distributorship package
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   with the initial purchase of all the products.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.040]   Now you've got a problem where you are incentivized to try to recruit the wrong people to sell
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.600]   product.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.620]   Sales is really, really tough.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:29.160]   It requires a lot of training, a lot of practice and/or a unique personality.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.880]   Most people are not cut out for direct sales.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.580]   Most people are not emotionally wired to be able to exist in that world of constant rejection
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.920]   without it flustering them.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.360]   So my biggest concern about many of these companies is the recruitment of people who
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.960]   are ill-suited to the industry.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.480]   Let me use life insurance as an example.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.960]   When I was in the life insurance business, I could recruit people to the company that
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   I was working with and I would get a bird dog fee if I recruited somebody in that ultimately
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.540]   wound up signing a contract.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:07.760]   But during the process of recruiting the agents, we interviewed dozens and dozens of people
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.440]   for every person that signed a contract.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.120]   Those people were put through rigorous tests to make sure that they were a good fit.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.680]   Even under those circumstances, personality profiles, multiple interviews, homework assignments
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.000]   to weed them out, background checks, et cetera, even under those circumstances, many people
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.160]   would allege that we still hired way too many people, way too many people who were not suited
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.840]   well for the industry.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.860]   That gave the industry that I was in a little bit of a bad rap because of the over-recruitment
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.960]   of people who were poorly suited for it.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.680]   We still had a massive failure rate.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.700]   Now I had experience with a network marketing company who was also involved in a similar
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.320]   business that I was in.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.960]   When I watched their recruiting policies, I was dumbfounded.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.360]   I was shocked and appalled at the type of person that they were interested in recruiting.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.600]   I actually take great pride in the fact that I talked a few of my friends who were being
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.160]   recruited by a company in the financial business out of the industry by giving them a little
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.980]   bit of knowledge, a little bit of inside experience because I saved them a significant amount
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.860]   of pain and suffering and problems.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.640]   I'm proud of that because I believe it was in their best interest, which brings me, as
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.880]   we continue on to the benefits of network marketing and more of the drawbacks of it.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:37.720]   One of the things I love about network marketing is the equality of the opportunity because
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.320]   there are very few screens.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.820]   If you want to find a distributor of any company that you got your eye on locally, you just
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.820]   start looking around.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.820]   You'll find them and they'll sign you up.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.820]   There are a few things.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.780]   You probably have to, in some cases, pass a background check.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.220]   There are certain things, but in general, you can get a distributorship with a network
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.540]   marketing company if you want one.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   So there are very few screens.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.500]   So there's tremendous opportunity.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:10.740]   For somebody who is blocked out of other industries, let's say that you don't have a college degree
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.420]   and the industry that you'd like to be in is going to require you to have a college
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   degree.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.980]   Well, in that situation, go and find a network marketing company.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.140]   They're not going to require a college degree.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.560]   There are many other things.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.640]   If you have certain things in your history or your past or in your way of living and
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.420]   your lifestyle that make you objectionable to be getting hired by some sales organizations,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:38.500]   you can get a sales job in a network marketing company pretty simply and pretty easily.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   That is very doable.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   I love that.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   I love that.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.900]   A quality of opportunity for any person.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:51.540]   And if you are coachable and if you can find somebody who can give you a plan, you can
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   use the law of large numbers to your good effect, you can hustle and you can build a
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:06.220]   massive, hugely lucrative business with just a very simple opportunity.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.820]   There are so many network marketing companies who have minted so many millionaires, people
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.220]   who came from disadvantaged backgrounds without a lot of knowledge or education, but they
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:25.220]   came in and they saw the business opportunity and they buckled down and worked.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   That can work.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:33.580]   In the process, you can transform your life from where you are to where you want to be.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.580]   I love that.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.180]   I said earlier that I have a short list of companies that have products or services that
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:45.620]   I think are unique, that are useful, and that fit well into the direct sales marketplace.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.900]   So I have those there.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.420]   But this also brings to the downside.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:59.100]   Because recruitment is so easy, it's easy to recruit the wrong people.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.900]   And because there can be a financial incentive off of those recruitment packages, it can
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:10.800]   be very lucrative to recruit the wrong people.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.500]   In general, it's my opinion that it's possible to do ethically.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:23.700]   But over time, this has led to a consistently bad reputation for many large network marketing
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.140]   companies.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.720]   That's why today you often hear somebody who is representing a network marketing or multi-level
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.260]   marketing opportunity, you often hear them saying, "Well, this is not multi-level marketing.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.460]   It's not network marketing.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.980]   I've been in these presentations or in these conversations."
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.380]   I look at them and say, "Yes, it is.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.580]   You're just trying to avoid the bad reputation."
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.060]   Now, is there a way out of that?
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.060]   I don't know.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.180]   I think the people who are successful just simply ignore that and go after it.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.980]   And they ignore all of that stuff and they just go and try to bring on more people.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:06.300]   Oftentimes great advantages and disadvantages work as the inverse of each other.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:12.820]   Network marketing is a great opportunity for anybody because there are no barriers to entry.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.980]   But because there are no barriers to entry, the industry is rife with problems.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.220]   The greatest benefit is also, in my opinion, one of the greatest flaws.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.060]   If you are going to succeed in network marketing – let me pause just a moment and I'll
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.180]   close with that little encouragement.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.140]   You need to be careful when you choose the company that you're choosing them and they
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.740]   have a legitimate competitive advantage in the product space that you're interested
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.740]   in.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:52.060]   Many network marketing companies sell expensive products that are overhyped and oversold.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.620]   Often this is due to the structure of the compensation.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:01.700]   If a company has a similar or equivalent product, that company might be able to sell it through
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.340]   a mass direct-to-consumer distribution system.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.340]   If they can cut out the whole expense of paying all those commissions to all the levels, they
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.180]   can sell it cheaper.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.020]   You can buy vitamins at Costco for pretty cheap.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:20.320]   You don't have to buy your vitamins from a specific fancy company that sells them to
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.500]   you through an individual person.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.180]   So you've got to make sure that you're choosing a company that has competitively
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.420]   priced products.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.260]   The other problem with the products is because companies often know that their products are
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:42.700]   going to be premium products, very expensive, then they run the risk of having those products
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.460]   commoditized.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.020]   And this has happened and is happening more and more.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:55.220]   And in order to try to avoid the trap of commoditization, the company can oversell the product.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.100]   I think there are possibly products that are legitimately unique and fantastic that are
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.180]   sold in this way.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:08.420]   So if you're going to join a company, it's my opinion, you had better be a believer,
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:15.860]   a true, hardcore, committed believer in the product and the mission of that company.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:21.220]   Because as one sales trainer I used to listen to would say, "Sales, successful, effective
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:28.140]   sales is simply the transference of emotion, the transference of enthusiasm.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.740]   If you feel the way about my product that I feel about my product, you're definitely
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.740]   going to buy.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.300]   There's no reason why you wouldn't buy."
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.660]   So the first person to be sold has to be the salesperson.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:43.860]   So you better make sure that you're choosing a product or service that you can sell without
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:50.540]   any reservation in order for you to be successful.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.340]   That is crucial.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.020]   You've got to choose that.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:03.580]   I think network marketing opportunities will become increasingly difficult as a larger
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:11.300]   and larger percentage of the population becomes digitally and internet literate.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.020]   Think about this.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.820]   When you use my Amazon link for radical personal finance and you click on something that I
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.020]   link to in the show, whenever I talk about a book or a product or something that I'm
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:28.420]   talking about, I'm telling you about something and I put that link in there to Amazon and
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.060]   I put an affiliate link.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.180]   I've signed up for an affiliate account with Amazon and when you click on that, your browser
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:41.140]   puts a little cookie in your browser and whatever you buy after clicking on that link for a
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:46.280]   period of time, I think it's 30 days, something like that, I will receive a small commission
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.100]   on the sale of the product.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.340]   You don't pay any more.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.300]   I just receive a small commission.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.380]   It's a few percent.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   Depends on the product.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.820]   I don't remember the exact percentages.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:02.020]   I make about $15 a month from Amazon commissions in the present circumstances.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.620]   In essence, what I have simply done there is replicated and what Amazon has done is
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.580]   replicated network marketing.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:16.980]   I signed up for a distributorship with Amazon and then I'm advertising products and services
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.860]   that they have for sale to you, my network.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:28.460]   Well, more and more companies can do that going direct through digital means and many
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.780]   network marketing companies don't permit that.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:38.940]   My biggest beef, remember I said that I have a few companies that I think I could work
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.860]   effectively in and make a fortune with?
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.420]   I don't think I'll ever pursue them because the power of being able to do it digitally
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:55.540]   is so much stronger than doing it one on one that I can't see pursuing them.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.020]   Many of the network marketing companies, a few of them don't, but many of them refuse
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:07.060]   to allow their representatives to have any kind of external independent digital marketing
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   presence.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:19.860]   You can have a generic, stupid, corporatized website on that company's website, networkmarketingcompany.joshuasheets.com
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:25.740]   and if people sign up through that link then you'll get a commission, but you can't do
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.260]   any kind of juicy, really good, powerful marketing with that because they got to protect their
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.260]   brand.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.860]   That's what they're worried about.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:38.540]   Because of that, it's a huge cost for someone like me who is functional and competent in
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.100]   the world of the internet.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.980]   Huge cost.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:50.180]   I wouldn't give up the leverage of the internet to go after a one on one sales opportunity,
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:56.200]   but there are many people who are not functional on the internet or who don't have any interest
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.700]   in digital marketing like I do.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.140]   For those people, the opportunity to sit down with somebody and do a presentation over a
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:09.740]   cup of coffee is powerful and can lead to a huge opportunity.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.800]   One more caution and I'll give you my closing advice.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.520]   Be careful when you sign up with a network marketing or multi-level marketing company.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:25.340]   Be careful about the products and resources that are dedicated to your business opportunity
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.480]   that you are encouraged to buy or to sign up for.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.040]   On the one hand, education is incredibly valuable.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.580]   Buying books, buying audio courses, attending seminars and conferences to help you become
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.860]   a better salesperson, this is hugely valuable.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.240]   Hugely valuable.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:55.940]   But on the other hand, it's easy to let your investment in this education and information
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:02.540]   far outstrip your earnings and profit.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.660]   Many people have made poor decisions.
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:13.100]   They filled the garage full of stuff, either physically or metaphorically, by making massive
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:19.020]   initial orders of products and services they didn't need but simply signed up for because
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.980]   of the business opportunity.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:30.400]   They bought mountains of training products at a very high price that they didn't implement
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.860]   into their own life.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:39.100]   Now a very small subset of the people who did that pushed through in the face of every
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:46.460]   obstacle and came out the other side with a massive booming business grateful for their
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.060]   success.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.500]   But many people faced those same circumstances and came out the other side with a big hairy
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.100]   credit card bill and a failed business.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.820]   And I don't want that to happen to you.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:05.140]   I think there's a real balance between optimism and prudence.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.900]   Always be optimistic.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.140]   Dream big.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.320]   Look for the huge opportunity.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:18.820]   But be prudent and careful and let your optimism be borne out by careful investigation, careful
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:26.860]   research and a careful approach to the investment of your hard-earned money.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:33.280]   I want you to have access to business opportunities that can help you to make your fortune.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.660]   But I don't want the only person who wins to be the person who signed you up for a big
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:48.540]   hairy distributorship contract that was accompanied with a lot of expensive overpriced products
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.420]   and the person who sold you a bunch of educational materials and got rich off of the sale of
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:01.560]   the info product and didn't effectively show you how to do the business without just marketing
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.240]   the info.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.420]   I would be remiss if I didn't point out the value of having something like a network marketing
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.080]   company as a part-time business.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.560]   I consistently recommend to you that you have some sort of part-time side business in your
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.400]   family.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:29.420]   This opens up many opportunities to you to transfer some of your expenses from the personal
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:37.840]   side of the expenditures, expenses that are made after tax, over to your business where
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.680]   you can pay for those expenses on a pre-tax basis.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.960]   Very simple example here would be health insurance.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.200]   If you have a $500 a month health insurance bill which is not being paid for by your employer
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.980]   and is just simply being paid out of your personal checking account, unless it exceeds
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.800]   the limitation for health insurance expenses, which is about 7.5% or 10% of adjusted gross
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   income now.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.920]   Anyway, most people are not going to exceed the health-related expenses of health insurance.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:12.560]   You're going to be paying that $500 a month on a post-tax basis, which means that you
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.880]   had to earn money, pay your employment taxes, and your income taxes to pay for your health
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   insurance.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:27.020]   Now, if you had a side business such as a network marketing business that was bringing
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.960]   in money that could account for that bill, then that would allow you to pay for that
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:38.520]   health insurance bill with deductible dollars so that you could save the money that you
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.320]   were spending on the employment and the income taxes, which could be substantial, could be
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.640]   minimal or could be substantial depending on your tax rate.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.400]   So there are plenty of legitimate reasons why you should always want to have a business
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.840]   in your family.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.480]   Without playing games and getting into the shenanigans, be careful.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.800]   There's a lot of bad advice given in the world of taxes, especially as it relates to
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.080]   businesses.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.880]   You cannot go on vacation and call it a business trip and expect it to pass muster with the
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.340]   IRS.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:16.040]   Business expenses are those that are ordinary and necessary for the conduct of your business.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.960]   But you can go to the industry convention that happens to be in a nice place and deduct
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.560]   those expenses.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.680]   You just can't go on vacation and call it a business trip.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   So be careful.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.400]   Obviously, the rule is not that you can't enjoy yourself on a trip.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:39.160]   If your company, your network marketing company is having their seminar in Honolulu, Hawaii,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.320]   you can go and you can have a good time.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.640]   You've just got to be there for business purposes.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:49.000]   And if you haven't arranged business purposes that are before or after the conference, you
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   can't hang out in Hawaii for a week on the taxpayer dime and list that as a deductible
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   expense.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.240]   Of course, you could use some, at least some or all of your airfare would be, even if you
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.040]   did hang out for a week.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.680]   The point is to emphasize that, yes, there are benefits to having a business and a multilevel
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.560]   marketing company can help in that space.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:22.120]   But make sure you're getting good advice there and make sure that you're not being foolish.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.600]   You have to actually conduct the business in a business-like manner.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.060]   If you're just, "Hey, once a year I do a presentation," not going to work, not going to happen.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.360]   You've got to actually be pursuing it.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.640]   So as with most things, these things are pretty straightforward.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.240]   Just make sure that you're going to pursue it.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.100]   So here's my advice for you if you're interested in something like a network marketing business.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.360]   Number one, recognize that it's probably not going to make you financially independent
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.260]   where you're going to have $10,000 a month coming in without your having to lift your
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.220]   finger and work.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.900]   Network marketing opportunities are not passive income opportunities.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:04.320]   They are residual income opportunities if you're using a company that offers a residual
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.760]   payment structure.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.800]   For example, if you're selling something like books, a company that sells books or a company
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:17.960]   that sells physical products, your sale is going to be based upon the initial sale of
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   what's actually sold.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.520]   There might not be repeat sales.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.640]   However, there are companies where the structure is built around repeat sales, either repeat
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.820]   sales where as long as they keep the product in force, such as an insurance product or
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.760]   such as a discount product of some kind, then you receive an ongoing commission, or there
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.120]   are companies that the actual product is a consumable item.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.520]   If they order $50 a month worth of product out of the company's catalog, then in that
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.600]   circumstance you'll continue to receive your commission for as long as things happen.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.760]   But this is residual income.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.320]   It's not passive income.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.480]   Over time, if you're not actively building and growing your network, it will atrophy.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.520]   People will find alternatives for the products that they used to think were fantastic, but
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.960]   now they think another product is fantastic.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   Some distributors that you signed up as representatives underneath you will fail.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.980]   Some of them will go on and join other companies that they're more excited about, etc.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.640]   So if you don't care and feed your network and your business, it will atrophy and eventually
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.480]   diminish significantly.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.620]   Be realistic and optimistic in what you're looking for.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.400]   Recognize that before you start dreaming of $20,000 a month, you'll first need to get
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.800]   to $200 a month.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.760]   It's okay to dream of $20,000 a month.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.280]   I worked with a couple of clients who had multi-six-figure incomes as leaders in network
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   marketing organizations.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.080]   I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.200]   It's possible, just not probable.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.280]   It's probably not you.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.000]   It's very possible to build a business that gives you a few hundred dollars a month on
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.120]   a part-time basis individually.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.640]   I've known many, many people who've built successful, effective businesses that either
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:05.800]   allow them to get their products for free, just like I can do with Amazon if my Amazon
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:12.280]   bill were only $15 a month, so it allows them to get their products for free, or that gives
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.640]   them a few hundred dollars a month because of their efforts.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.600]   This is eminently doable with many companies.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Start with that.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.800]   The people who move on to make the tens of thousands of dollars a month are those who
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.920]   are going to pursue this vigorously on a full-time basis.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.840]   That full-time might come in the future, but maybe you're working part-time now and you
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:38.720]   want to transition over on a full-time basis, and who have developed significant sales and
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.520]   sales management skills.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.840]   That could be you if you apply yourself.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.880]   Without a doubt in my mind, if I were left without other options that I were more excited
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.840]   about, I could go, I could join a network marketing company, and I could build a massive
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   sales organization that would give me ongoing residual income, control over my time, flexibility
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.800]   of schedule, and a significant amount of money.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.640]   I could do that, and you probably could too if you want it bad enough and you're willing
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.840]   to work at it, but don't think it's going to come easy.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.560]   I listened to a great presentation a couple years ago from a guy who was involved in a
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.960]   nutritional supplement company that was famous for their shakes, and he talked about his
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.880]   work schedule.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.580]   This man was making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, living an excellent lifestyle,
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:41.480]   and he worked 85 hours a week for many years, 70 or 80 hours a week.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:49.280]   He worked early in the morning, all day long, at night, and he used every possible method
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.920]   of getting involved with people.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.960]   He didn't get there just by talking to people that were his friends and selling them a few
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.000]   products at a sales presentation.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.360]   He got there by talking to people who were his friends and then going out and systematically
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.240]   soliciting other people to work in a sales organization, and it worked.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.720]   So I don't see anything inherently wrong with network marketing or multilevel marketing,
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.000]   at least nothing inherently wrong with the structure.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.800]   I see problems in the application, and I see companies that you should stay away from.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.160]   If you follow the guidelines that I've given you, then there are companies that you will
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.880]   come across and you'll say, "Wait a second.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.960]   This is a major problem.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.000]   Move on."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.040]   But I do see a lot of opportunity.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.640]   So if you're excited by that—and by the way, you need to be excited by the prospect
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.920]   of person-to-person meetings, person-to-person marketing.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.400]   If you get excited by that, then a network marketing company might be good for you.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.000]   In many ways, I think they're best served for the person who's going to do it on a part-time
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.760]   basis without trying to make it into a huge, huge business.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.280]   Why do I say that?
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.240]   Because I think if you were to apply that same work ethic and the same knowledge and
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:11.800]   the same level of focus to other areas that are not network marketing, I think you could
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   do far better.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.400]   Depending on your skills and your interests, I think that you could do far better.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.800]   In that network marketing example I said, where I said I'm confident I could go and
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.600]   I've seen other people who've built legitimately—I've done their financial planning for them—legitimately
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:32.080]   a couple hundred thousand dollars a year of income, well, why would I not go do that?
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.760]   Because I could take those same skills and I can go to the life insurance business or
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.240]   the financial planning business and I could become a general agent and I can make a few
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.280]   million dollars a year.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.880]   So why would I not go and become a general agent of a life insurance company, make a
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.160]   million or a couple or three million dollars a year instead of making a few hundred thousand
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.080]   dollars a year with a network marketing company?
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.140]   That would be my perspective.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.680]   But other people might not have that approach.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.200]   Many people don't have any interest or knowledge of finance, et cetera, and you've got to weigh
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.880]   your options.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.040]   So I hope this show has been useful to give you some ideas about some of the opportunities
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.760]   that are really available to you.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.600]   I hope that you can take this information and implement it in your own life.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.560]   Don't run from network marketing opportunities.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.120]   I like to go to the presentations.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.560]   I like to learn about the opportunities.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.520]   It's been a while since I've reviewed one.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.240]   So I think they're useful.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.520]   My biggest beef is oftentimes it's going to be restricted to person-to-person sales.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.400]   At this point, that's a no-go for me.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.000]   I can do better with Amazon just because I can sell it more broadly and many people agree.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.320]   But for you, network marketing could be really, really good.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:45.360]   I hope this arms you with the information you need to be an educated consumer.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.080]   Be optimistic and prudent in all things.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.440]   That's it for today's show.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   I hope you've enjoyed this.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.360]   This show, I hope, has been helpful to you.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.520]   If you have additional questions about network marketing, if you think there's something
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.280]   I missed, if you think I was wrong about something, then come on by the show page at RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   and comment on today's show.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   Let me know.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.640]   If I didn't correctly correct anything I got wrong or if you spotted something, I'd be
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.000]   happy to know about it.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Thank you for listening.

[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.360]   Now I'm stammering flat-footed and not knowing what to say.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.160]   Tell you what, just send me the money directly.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   Joshua Radical.

[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   I'm out.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   It's been a long day.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.400]   Up too early and not thinking straight.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:19.320]   I'll be back with you tomorrow.
