[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   I would like to call your attention this evening to the words found in Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.080]   Ephesians in chapter 6, reading verses 18, 19, and 20.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.640]   Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.080]   all perseverance and supplication for all saints, and for me, that utterance may be
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.360]   which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.280]   I am concerned, as most of you will realize with this phrase, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.640]   The apostle there is asking these Ephesian Christians to pray for him that he may be
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.880]   given grace and strength and power and wisdom and expression in declaring this which he
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.040]   describes as the mystery of the gospel.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840]   Now we have been looking at this mystery of the gospel these Sunday nights in this month
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.640]   of October, month of November, and in doing that we have been following on from what we
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.840]   were considering in the previous month.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.520]   We have been looking, in other words, at what the New Testament itself has got to tell us
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240]   about the nature of this gospel.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.480]   Oh, I need not paint the picture again.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   Look at the world.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.280]   You see its state and its condition.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   What does it need?
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.120]   Well, what it needs above everything else is the message of this gospel, this Christian
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   message.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.160]   But, alas, there is such terrible confusion as to what it is.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.640]   The problem of this time in which you and I are living is the problem of authority.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   That is why you have got confusion.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   These are days like the days described in the book of Judges.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.560]   There was no king in Israel in those days.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.480]   Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.120]   And that is what people are doing today, putting their own opinions before the word of God
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.360]   in the Bible, putting up their opinions before the Ten Commandments and God's moral laws,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.600]   every man deciding for himself what is truth, what is moral, what is immoral, what is right,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.760]   what is wrong, no respect for any authority at all.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.920]   And of course, we are seeing and reaping the consequences of such a fatal attitude.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.520]   I say, therefore, that the greatest need of this world tonight is to know this gospel,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   its message.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   What is it?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, now, we have been examining the various terms that are used with respect to it, and
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.520]   we are dealing at the moment with this special one, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.600]   And I have spent a lot of time on this one because, as I have been trying to show, it
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   is this, I think, that constitutes the greatest difficulty which most people seem to have
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.720]   with believing this gospel, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.040]   Now, it works like this, you see.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   They do not realize at the very beginning that this is altogether different from everything
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   else they have ever known.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   They will come with their science and their philosophy, their politics and their otherâ€”they
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.280]   are already wrong, already wrong.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.880]   There is a notice put up at the very door of entry to the consideration of the gospel,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   and here it is.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.400]   "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   kingdom of heaven."
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.480]   So, if you come along as a great scientist, you will never get in.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.560]   If you come as a great philosopher, the door is shut.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.360]   If you come as a great politician, no entry.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.280]   Come as any great anything, you will never get in.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   Now, our Lord has put up the notice himself.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   This is the part of the mystery.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.360]   Mystery in the New Testament means this.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.200]   It means something that is secret and hidden from the mind and the understanding of men,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.320]   but which God in his infinite grace has been pleased to reveal and to make known by his
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   Spirit.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.640]   That is the mystery.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.200]   The mystery of the gospel is something that men would never have thought of, never imagined,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.640]   but it is the mind and the wisdom of God, and God has been pleased to reveal it.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.880]   And he has done so supremely in the person of his only begotten Son.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.520]   Now, there was the initial approach.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.240]   It is an essential mystery.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.280]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.200]   him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually deserved.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.280]   Then we saw how this mystery works itself out in many different ways.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   The whole question of God's relationship to this world and God's treatment of this world
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.440]   is a great mystery, the mystery of providence.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.920]   God's dealings with the world, that is the theme of the whole of the Bible in a sense.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   We looked at that.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.200]   Then we looked at the central mystery.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   This is the central mystery.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   Let me quote those immortal lines of Charles Wesley once more.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   "Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see, Hail incarnate Deity."
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Paradox, if you like.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Where is the human mind?
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   What is the value of a human mind when you are confronted by an essential mystery like that?
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   The mystery of the person, of Jesus Christ, Son of God, God and men, two natures, one person.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   That's the mystery of the gospel and all that he did.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   And then last Sunday night we concentrated especially, of course, upon the mystery of his death.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   What is he of everybody doing and dying on a cross?
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   What is this?
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   What's the meaning of this?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   And we saw this is the heart and center and nerve of the gospel.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   There is only salvation in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   The mystery of the gospel.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   The apostle went around the world declaring this and he prays,
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   asked these people to pray for him that he may be given utterance, he may be given boldness.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   He says, "At the moment I'm in prison, I'm an ambassador in bonds,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   but pray that I may be set at liberty, that I may go out and tell people again about the mystery of this gospel."
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's the thing they need.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   And it's still the thing needed in the world tonight.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   But now let's go on and look at another aspect because that doesn't end this mystery of the gospel.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   There is something further that we must of necessity consider together as we are looking at this great theme.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   We may well describe it as the mystery of the way of salvation.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   The mystery of the way of salvation.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   We've already seen that there is only one way of forgiveness.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   We all need forgiveness.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   What we need above everything else is to know God,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   to be rightly related to him that he may bless us.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   But our sin comes in the way.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   And our sins have got to be dealt with.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   How can our sins be forgiven?
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   How can a man be reconciled to God?
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   Well, we've seen there's only one answer.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   It is entirely in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   It's because he died that we might be forgiven.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   He died to make us good.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   It's the whole explanation of the mystery of his death.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   And God, once a man believes in him and what he's done on his behalf,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   God looks on such a man, he declares him to be just.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   He clothes him with the righteousness of Christ.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   And he is reconciled to God.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   But that, I say, is not all.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   That, indeed, is only the first and the initial step.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   And there is nothing more fatal than to stop at that point.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   And that's the thing we've got to deal with this evening.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   There's a mystery about this.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   People seem to think, those who believe in God, many of them,
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   they think that all they need is to be forgiven.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   They recognize they're not perfect and that they're sinners
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   and they need to be forgiven.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And they say, "God is love and God will forgive me."
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   And they think that then all is well.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   But it isn't.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   That is only the beginning.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   It's an essential beginning.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   And if a man isn't clear about the only way whereby his sins can be forgiven,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   obviously he cannot proceed any further.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   It's no use thinking of anything beyond that
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   if you're not already on the right road.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   There's only one way of entry.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   It's old John Bunyan's wicket gate again, and it leads to a cross.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   And it's only there the burden drops off.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   You've got to go through that wicket gate.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Repentance, belief on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   acknowledgement, confession of your sin, your inability, your hopelessness,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   trusting only to the fact that he bore your sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   That's the wicket gate. You've got to go through it.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   And it'll bring you to that inevitable position.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   There you lose your burden.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   But you see, you haven't arrived in the celestial city at that point.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   No, no, you've got a tremendous long way to go.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   And I come now to the thing that comes next in this
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   "Ordo salutis," order of salvation.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   And these steps are most important,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   and it is helpful that we should have a certain intellectual order
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   in mind and under consideration.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   What is this next thing?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Well, it's what you may call, if you like,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   the necessity of being born again.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   The necessity, if you prefer it, of regeneration.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   Or if you prefer it again, the absolute need of having a new heart,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   of becoming a new creature, or a new creation.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   Now, here again, we are face to face with one of the great mysteries of the gospel.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   This again is one of the things that the natural man,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   that's to say the man who's not a Christian,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   and the man who doesn't see his need of the enlightenment and illumination
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   of the Holy Spirit, never can understand at all.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   But here it is.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   And of course, it is a very vital and integral part of the New Testament message.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   I was thinking to myself as I was preparing this message,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   the number of texts that I could have taken.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   There are so many of them.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   This is a subject that is dealt with almost everywhere.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   Now, I read at the beginning that famous instance of this teaching
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   that's to be found in the third chapter of the gospel according to Saint John,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   because it's such a dramatic one, and everybody can see it and remembers it,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   and conjures up this picture of this learned rabbi,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   this great master of Israel, Nicodemus,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   and how it was to him of all men that our Lord made this astonishing statement.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   But it's not the only one.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   It runs right through the whole of the gospel of John.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   Our Lord really said the same thing to the woman of Samaria
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   when he said unto her, "He that drinketh of this water shall thirst again,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   He goes on and says, "I am the bread of life.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   I am the light of the world."
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   It's running through the whole of these gospels.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   The apostle Paul has it in exactly the same way.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   He says, "If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature, a new creation.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   All things are passed away.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   In the world, all things have become new."
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   Peter's got it.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   "Being born again," he says, "not of corruptible seed,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   but of incorruptible by the word of God that liveth and abideth forever."
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   In the second epistle, Peter puts it, "We are made partakers of the divine nature."
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   John's got it.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   "Whosoever believeth," he says, "is born of God."
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   "The seed," he says, "remaineth in us.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   By this we know that we have eternal life."
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   He's full of it.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   It is indeed the great central theme of the New Testament.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   Now, I have known certain preachers who have preached on a given text,
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   the same text, every year.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   They've felt that every year in the ministry,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   they must preach on a particular text because it's so vital.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   Were I to do something like that,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   I have a feeling that the kind of text that I would choose would be something like that.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   On one of these texts I've quoted to you,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   this, of course, was the central theme of the preaching 200 years ago.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   Whitefield and the Westleys here in London and throughout England,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Jonathan Edwards and others,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   the great message, in a way, of the evangelical awakening was this great theme of the rebirth.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   John Wesley preached on that text.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   He must be born again in Oxford.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   He was never asked to preach there again.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   Now, that's typical.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   Here, you see, is the great emphasis.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   Here is the great message.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   And it's a message that has been preached and given great prominence
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   in every great revival in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Now then, let's have a look at this.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   Let's do what we've been doing with the other aspects of the mystery.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   Let's take a hurried glance at some of the ways in which men deny this particular mystery at the present time.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   I don't want to keep you with this, but I must show you some of these objections
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   in order that you may all realize that we are more than fully aware of them.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   There's nothing new about these again.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   They just put it in a slightly different way.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   One of the favorite ways of getting rid of this at the present time is to say this.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   They say, "Yes, but of course the trouble with you is you're a literalist
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   because you read there, 'Except a man be born again.'
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   You, you, of course, you're a literalist, and you say that this means something that actually happens.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   You can't see that our Lord was speaking in a figurative manner.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   What he was really saying was this.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   He says, "You know, when a man rarely understands my message,
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   he feels like a man who rarely has entered into a new world."
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   That does happen, they say.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   There are many, many examples of it, of men who suddenly, in reading a book,
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   have their whole outlook changed.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   You wouldn't say that anything vital or essential had really happened to them.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   All that happens is that a man suddenly grasps a teaching he'd never seen before,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   and he seems to be like a man in a new world, as if he'd started living, born again.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   That's all it is, they say.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   You mustn't take these things too literally, but that is what some of you tend to do.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   So they think that the whole thing can be explained in some such literary manner,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   that it's just a pictorial, graphic way of describing a great change taking place in a man's life.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   But, of course, the favorite objection is the so-called psychological one.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   This is the age of psychology.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   Psychology is controlling everything, isn't it?
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   Even business.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   How men ever sold anything in the past, I don't know.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   Because, you see, they hadn't had the advantage of lectures on the psychology of salesmanship.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   They hadn't been able to make these investigations and know exactly the right approach.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Psychology.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   And here, of course, we are familiar with the argument.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   It was put in a book published a few years back, which I attempted to reply to,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   a book called "The Battle of the Mind".
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   And there, you see, the whole thing is explained in terms of a purely psychological process,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   a kind of production of a conditioned reflex, the sort of thing you can do with animals.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   And so an attempt was made to explain away all these great cases of conversion in the New Testament,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   such as the Apostle Paul and others.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   Well, there is an answer to all that.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   I gave it in a little booklet, which I called "Conversion, Psychological and Spiritual".
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   I don't repeat that this evening.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   But there it is.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   And another form that this argument tends to take is this.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   That, after all, this is purely a question of psychology.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Though there are many people who put it in this way.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   They say, "You know, I don't object to your being a Christian.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   I don't object really to your saying that you're born again.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   What I do object to," says the man, "is that you say that I ought to be a Christian also,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   and that I must be born again."
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   Why does he put it like that?
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Well, he does it for this reason.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   He says, of course, this is purely a matter of psychology.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   There are two main types of people, the once-born type and the twice-born type.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   Now, the once-born type is the more solid, reliable, equitable kind of person.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   But there's this other type.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   It's all right.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   There's nothing wrong in it in and of itself.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   This other man is this twice-born type.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   These are people who undergo violent changes.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   You get them doing it with politics.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   A man starts out as perhaps extreme communist, and he ends as an extreme conservative.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   There are people who do that sort of thing.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   You see, they're this twice-born type, and there are people like that, they say,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   with respect to religion.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   Or they may put it like this, that they've got a religious complex.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   Now, they're the people in whom you'd expect that.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   But they say it's monstrous and ridiculous to postulate that for everybody,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   or to say that everybody needs this.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   Why don't you recognize, they say, these psychological types?
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   If you're born the religious type, all right, you'll get experiences probably.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   But if you don't happen to be born the religious type, well, then you won't get them,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   and nobody should say to you that you ought to get them.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   You see, the whole thing is avoided, the mystery is removed,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   in terms of some psychological explanation.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Now, I haven't the time to go into all these things.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   I could, I've done so at times, but let me just sum up what I would say about that particular argument.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   It's simply a question of fact.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   You have only to look at those twelve men who were disciples of our Lord and who became apostles
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   to get the complete answer to that.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   I can't imagine two more different men than Peter and John.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   And yet the same thing happens to both.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   The Apostle Paul is different from both of them.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   In other words, there in the New Testament,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   you've got it in a chapter like the sixteenth chapter of Acts,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   the quiet lady Lydia and the violent Philippian jailer,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   same thing happens to both.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   And then you read the subsequent history of the Christian church,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   and this is what you're entitled to say,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   that there is no conceivable type of psychology or temperament or makeup,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   call it what you like,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   but that you find it in the Christian church,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   and that they have had the same experience.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   I can't imagine two more different men than Martin Luther and John Calvin.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   One of them an explosive kind of man, a kind of volcanic individual, Martin Luther.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Calm, quiet, reasoning, controlled, logical, John Calvin.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   Same thing happened to both and put in Blaise Pascal with them.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   Quite different again, brilliant mathematician.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   You read his account of that extraordinary experience he had one night,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   with all his genius and his blazing ability.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   Same thing.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   Now then, I'm challenging you.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   There is not a conceivable type of personality
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   or any conceivable permutation or combination of personalities,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   but that you have found them and still find them in the Christian church.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   Those are some of the modern objections.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   But what is the cause of this objection?
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   Why should men object to this teaching about the rebirth?
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   And it's not difficult to answer at all.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   It's just part of the general objection to the supernatural,
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   to the miraculous.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   It's this old business again of the 20th century men.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   The men of knowledge, the men of science.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   But you know, I really don't understand the modern men at this point.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   I can understand the men of say a hundred years ago
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   objecting to the miraculous and the marvelous.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   Why? Well, because their science then was a very mechanistic affair,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   a very materialistic affair.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   But you know, that's all gone.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   The more the scientists do their research work today,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   the more they reveal the mystery.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   Indeed, I was reading quite recently a scientific article
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   dealing with these matters in which the men writing
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   was more or less prepared to admit that we never would discover
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   the mystery of life.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   You know how they're working on the mystery of the cell,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   the individual cell,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   and the astounding things they're discovering
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   about some of these amino acids and other things.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   Some of you are studying these matters.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Now the whole thing is a tremendous mystery.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   It's almost incredible that the whole of our life, as it were,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   should depend upon that.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   The more the true scientists are working today,
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   I mean by that the men who are not trying to speak as philosophers,
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   but the men who are really just doing the honest research
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   and discovering and describing facts.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   The more the mystery grows,
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   so that it seems to me to be very out of date
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   to object to the teaching of the gospel
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   simply because it tells us that it is mysterious,
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   that it's marvelous, that it's miraculous,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   it's beyond understanding.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   They're saying that more and more,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   I'm reminding you of the life of the individual cell.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   This objection to the supernatural and the miraculous
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   is really becoming outmoded and out of date.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   The new theology is behind the times,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   as it always has been and always will be.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   No, no, there's only one theology that's up to date.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   It's the old one.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   That's always true.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   The others are not.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   Secondly, under this heading of objections,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   and this perhaps is the real explanation,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   it isn't so much that they object to the supernatural and the miraculous.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   What men rarely object to in this teaching about being born again
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   is that it is an insult to him.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   How? Well, it's like this.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   If I say to you, "You must be born again,"
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   what am I really saying?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   Well, what I'm really telling you is this,
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   that as you are, you're hopeless.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   That you're so hopeless that you can't be improved even.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   That what you need is not a new coat of paint.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   You need to be made again.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   The whole thing's wrong.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   You must be sent back to the works, to the maker.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   You don't need just to be readjusted.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   You need to be born again.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   And the modern man sees that and he says,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   "This is a downright insult."
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   It's monstrous to tell men as he is,
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   with all his knowledge and learning and understanding,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   that he's nothing, that he's got nothing,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   that he's so hopeless that he really needs to be made from the very beginning all anew.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   It's a sure insult.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   And of course, that has been the objection.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   It's said that this preaching of this gospel,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   the preaching of the cross and the preaching of regeneration,
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   is an insult to mankind.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   It's been the brake upon the march of human progress.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   It's been the thing that has stood between the masses of the people
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   throughout the centuries and arriving at their own glorious heritage.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   So you must get rid of religion.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Voltaire, Rousseau, those are your men who began to propagate it and to preach it,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   and others have come.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   Nietzsche says, "God is dead and we don't need him any longer.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   He's been the trouble."
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   And this preaching that has depressed men and kept him down,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   "Trust yourselves, express yourselves, manifest your personality,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   let the greatness that's in you come out," that's been the theory.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   And we are reaping the results of such preaching.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   And we are seeing what happens.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   But those are the objections.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   But come, let us turn from them and look at this metapositively.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   "From us all this thought comes this word of the Son of God,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   the mystery of godliness.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   you must be born again.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   except a man be born of water and the Spirit,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   It's a must.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   It's an absolute necessity.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Why?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   Now, here's the vital point.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   Why must every man born into this world be born again?
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   This is the mystery to the natural man.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   He's prepared to believe in moral uplift,
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   he's prepared to believe in improvement,
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   he's prepared to believe in anything that is going to make things a little bit better,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   but what he cannot apply is this suggestion that we must be born again.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   Why is this an absolute necessity?
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   And here I think we really come to the crux of the difficulty.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   This is the mystery to the modern man,
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   to the natural man always.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   Why is it an absolute necessity?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   It is an absolute necessity because Christianity is not just a point of view.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   It's not just a matter of certain ideas.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   It's not just a question of conduct.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   It's not just a matter of behavior.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Now, that is the fatal error.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   I have to keep on repeating this because, you see, the explanation is always the same.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   Men think that to be a Christian means that you take up certain Christian ideas,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   Christian points of view, Christian attitudes.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   That's the popular notion of Christianity today.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   So that if a man isn't always preaching about war or South Africa, he's not preaching the gospel.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   It's a matter of holding certain attitudes and ideas and points of view.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   Others put all their emphasis upon conduct and behavior.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   The Christian is just a moral man. The Christian is just a good man.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   The Christian is just a nice man.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   The Christian is a man who doesn't do certain things, he does certain other things.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   But, my dear friends, that isn't Christianity.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   You say, "That isn't Christianity?" I do. That is not Christianity.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   What is the essence of Christianity?
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   It is this. And here is the one thing we've got to grasp.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   It is to have fellowship with God.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   It is to know God.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   Here is the thing that the Bible itself emphasizes, our Lord himself does.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   Listen to it. He says, "This is life eternal."
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   What is it?
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   "I know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   Did you notice it in the reading at the beginning?
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   That he should not perish but have eternal life, everlasting life.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   What is everlasting life?
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   To know God.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   And to have fellowship with God.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   Now, a man can be highly moral, can't point a finger at him,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   he may be a paragon of all the virtues, and yet not be a Christian at all.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   Why? He doesn't know God.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   He doesn't have fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   The man may have all the attitudes that you want him to have on war and peace
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   and education and commerce and what nations should do,
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   he may have 100% and still not be a Christian.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   Because the thing that makes a man a Christian is that he knows God.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   You see, our Lord put it like this when the clever fellows came to him and said to him,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   "Now, look here, you claim to be a teacher. Which is the first and the greatest commandment?"
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   And they wondered what he was going to say.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Was it the tithe mint or rue or anise or cummin?
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.200]   Was it one of these details or minutiae? That's what they thought.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.200]   And then they would have argued with him.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   He cut the ground from beneath their feet by saying,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   "This is the first and the greatest commandment.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   That is the first and the chiefest commandment.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   The second is likened to it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   It's always this knowledge of God, this fellowship with God.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   And you see, the moment you grasp that, you see why it is of necessity true
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   that a man must be born again. Why?
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   Well, look at it like this. Look at the nature of God.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   We read in the prologue of this Gospel of John,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   And it's true. No man can see God and live. Why?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   Well, the Gospel goes on to tell us, "God is spirit."
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   God is everywhere. God is omnipresent. God is spirit.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   And therefore no man can possibly see him.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   But listen to the other things we are told.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   Our blessed Lord and Savior in all his perfection,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   when he prays, he prays like this,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   He speaks and he says, "Holy Father."
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   You see, that's personal communion.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   He's in the presence of the living God.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   And God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   The Old Testament saints had realized this.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   Listen to one of them crying out, "Who can dwell with the burning fire?"
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   David realizes it, "Thou requirest truth in the inward parts."
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   No man can fool God.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   He knows everything.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   "All things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   And God has made this plain to us.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   He says, "My thoughts are not your thoughts.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   Neither are your ways my ways,"
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   saith the Lord.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   "But as the heavens are higher than the earth,
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   so are my thoughts and your thoughts and my ways and your ways."
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   That's God, you see.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   Oh, my dear friends, the trouble with all of us is we don't know God.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   We don't know God.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   And we argue and talk about our little goodnesses
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   and all our little moralities
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   and all our attitudes and understandings.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   That's not it.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   The question is, do you know this living God,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   the Father of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   This is why we must be born again,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   because God is who and what he is.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   And then think of his mind and of his purposes.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   "All God thinks and proposes the mind of the Lord."
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   Oh, says Paul, who knew more about this than any other man has ever known.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   There's no end to them.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   There's no limit to them.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   Deep unfathomable minds of God's mind and wisdom and understanding,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   all his eternal purposes thought before the foundation of the world,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   these are the things that are true of God.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   "If I have told you earthly things," says Christ in Nicodemus,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   "and you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?"
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   even the Son of Man which is in heaven."
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   "If you don't understand what I'm saying in earthly terms," says our Lord,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   "how then can you possibly understand if I begin to reveal to you
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   the things I have seen in heaven face to face with my Father?"
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   "You can't. You must be born again."
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   Well, there's one answer, and it's enough in itself.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   But let me give you the other side.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   What makes it equally essential for us to be born again
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   is our state and condition by nature.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   What's that?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   Well, I could quote you so many passages here.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   Perhaps one of the best is the Apostle Paul in the epistle to the Romans in chapter 8,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   where he puts it in the form of a great contrast.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Listen.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   "They that are after the flesh to mind the things of the flesh,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   because the carnal mind is enmity against God,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   So then, they that are in the flesh cannot please God,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   but ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, and so on."
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   Now, then, what does all that mean?
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   Let me summarize it for you like this.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   The trouble with us all by nature is that we are in the flesh.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   We are carnal.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   Our Lord puts it in Nicodemus.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   That which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   Yes, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   You see, the two realms are entirely different.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   And we all of us by nature are born in the flesh.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   We are born the inheritors of a fallen nature.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   The first thing a child does is to do something its parents have told it not to do.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   Every child wants to put its finger in the fire.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   You tell it not to do it, it will do it.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   Why does a child want to do this?
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   We are born of the flesh, my friends.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   We are born the result of the sins of centuries.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   None of us is born pure and innocent and clean.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   We are all born tarnished, besmirched, twisted, perverted.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   It is in us all, and it comes out.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   We show it immediately.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   That is flesh.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   And as the apostle says, because we are born of the flesh,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   we have no understanding of the things of the Spirit.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   You see, our whole outlook is wrong.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   What is wrong with a man who is not a Christian is not this or that, it is everything.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   That is the point.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   That is why he must be born again.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   It is not that he is wrong in certain details.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   There is nothing more fatal than to think that Christianity
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   is something that puts you right in bits here and there, or modifies you.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   It is not. It is a new birth.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Why? Because a man is born of the flesh.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   He is all wrong.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   His whole outlook is wrong.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   His total outlook is wrong.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   His view of himself is wrong.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   His view of God is wrong.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   You noticed what Paul says.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   The nature of the carnal mind is enmity against God.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   And isn't it true?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   Man by nature, he hates God.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   He would be delighted if somebody could prove,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   if a scientist could demonstrate by looking down a microscope
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   that there isn't a God, they would be ready to believe it.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   If it was in a popular newspaper tomorrow morning,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   why would they jump at it? Because they hate God.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   But you say, I have always believed in God. Have you?
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   I would like to know what your God is like.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   The moment a man faces the God that has revealed himself in the Bible,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   he hates Him.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   He hates the Ten Commandments.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   That is why they are spitting on them today.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   That is why they are all breaking them.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   They are all apparently nice, respectable people.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   Nobody believes in these things any longer.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   That is a hatred of God.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   For the law is a manifestation of the character of God.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   And the natural carnal mind is enmity against God,
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   is not subject to the law of God,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   neither indeed can be.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   Our whole thinking is wrong.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.200]   We have got a bias against God, a hatred of God.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   We mind, says the apostle, the things of the flesh.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   And that is what the world is doing tonight.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   When he says, they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   they that are of the spirit do mind the things of the spirit,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   he means they give their time and attention to them.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   These are the things that excite them and enthrall them.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   These are the things that stimulate them and they find intriguing.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   What are they?
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   What are the things that the mind of the flesh minds tonight?
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   Well, I need not tell you.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   The usual.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   Drink. Oh, yes. Drink.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   There is a way to get life.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   Take alcohol. Knock out your higher centers.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Then, these are the things that your elemental instincts will come out then,
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   the things of the flesh, they mind them.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   And the whole of society is organized like this.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   Biographies are most valuable.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   I always read biographies. I commend them to you.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   And I am getting old enough, you know, to remember men that were sort of idols to many of us before the First World War.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   And the biographies are coming out and we see that our idols are feet of clay,
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   things of the flesh.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   Mind the things of the flesh rather than the things of the spirit.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   Indeed, let me sum it up.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   The apostle puts it in these graphic, dramatic words.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   He says, "I am carnal, sold under sin.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   Have you realized that about yourself?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   It's true of every one of us.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   What horrible creatures we are.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   What a veritable menagerie lies beneath the surface.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   I know we can put on the appearance of innocence and of altruism, idealism,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   but oh, the things that go on beneath the surface.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   The thing to do if you're at a party is not to listen to what's said with a loud voice.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   Listen to the whispers.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Listen to the cattiness, the backbiting.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   Listen to the comments and the criticisms.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Oh, the dishonesty of it all.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   "In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   It's rotten.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   That's men by nature.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   And it leads him eventually to say, "Oh, wretched men that I am,
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   who can deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   Our Lord has said it all in that 19th chapter of this third,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   19th verse of the third chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   This is the condemnation.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   What is the condemnation?
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   Well, here it is.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   That light is come, or has come, into the world.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   And it's true, you know, the light has come into the world.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   God's Son came into the world nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   We are approaching the season of Christmas.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   The light of the world came into the world.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   The babe was born in Bethlehem.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   He is the light of the world.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   He is the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   The light has come.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   Everything the human race needs to know tonight has already been revealed in God's Son.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   Why doesn't the whole world believe it then?
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   Why does this terrible thing happen in the Congo?
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   Why have we had our two world wars?
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   Why is there a threat of another war?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   What's the matter?
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Why isn't the human race what it should be?
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   Why don't they believe the light?
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   Our Lord answers the question.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   This is the condemnation.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   That light is come into the world.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   But men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   But he that doeth truth cometh to the light,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   Here's the condemnation.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   Man loves the darkness and hates the light.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   He doesn't want the light.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   Of course, he wants them to have light in South Africa.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   And he waxes eloquent.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   But he's doing the same thing in his own personal behavior.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   How often have I put that from this pulpit,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   the horror with which people held up their hands
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   when Hitler marched into Austria and took it.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   What a shocking thing they said.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   And they waxed eloquent.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Men waxed eloquent over that
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   who had done exactly the same thing with other men's wives.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   There's nothing wrong in that.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   I remember reading during the war
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   two items the same week in the same newspaper.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   The first item was that a certain man
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   who was then very well known and popular
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   in a certain ability which he had,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   this man had made it known,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   and the paper was very glad to give publicity to it,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   that he was very distressed by these horrible rumors
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   that were going round
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   that he was not fundamentally loyal to this country.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   Rumors had been spread apparently
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   that he'd had Nazi sympathies before the war and so on.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   And they were impugning this man's honesty
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   and integrity in this way.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   And this was now put in the papers.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   This was a horrible suggestion
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   that a man like this wasn't loyal to his country,
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   wasn't a man who would honor his bond
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   with regard to his country.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   Two days later, in the same paper,
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   I read just a little notice,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   not as big as the first one,
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   that the decree naisai,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   which this man's wife had had against him
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   because of his adultery with another woman,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   was now made absolute.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   You see, it's a terrible thing to say
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   that a man's not loyal to his country,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   but it's nothing if a man's disloyal
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   to his marriage vows and to his wife.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   So we hold up our holy hands
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   about what they do in South Africa or America
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   or somewhere else or this country
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   when somebody else's action is political.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   My friends, what about your own personal actions?
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   That's the question that you should be concerned with.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   And the moment you do face it,
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   you'll find that Paul speaks the truth
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   when he says that the trouble with all of us by nature
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   is that we love darkness rather than light
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   because our deeds are evil.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   We don't want to be disturbed.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   We prefer sin to holiness.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   We prefer man and wrong to God and truth
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   and holiness and righteousness.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   And it's only when a man becomes convicted by this gospel
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.200]   that he cries out with David and he says,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   "Create within me a clean heart, O God,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   He realizes that what he needs
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   is not simply forgiveness or to be put right here or there.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   He needs to be cleaned.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   He wants a new heart.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   He needs a new everything.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   He needs to be born again.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   Very well then, I say, here's my argument.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   Why must a man be born again?
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   And the answer is that he must be born again
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   because if he isn't, he'll never have communion with God.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   There is no communion between light and darkness.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   There is no communion between right and wrong.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   There is no communion between God and Belial.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.200]   God, in his utter holiness,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   and man in his filthiness and vileness,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   communion is impossible.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   So if I want to enjoy the fellowship
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   and the companionship of God while I'm in this world,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   I must be born again.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   And I'll give you a still more powerful argument.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   Why must a man be born again?
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   I'll tell you.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   If he isn't, heaven would be nothing but hell to him.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   Have you ever thought of yourself in heaven
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   where all is pure and clean and holy?
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   Where those bright angelic spirits spend all their time in saying,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts."
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   Nothing unclean, nothing impure,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   no alcoholic drink, no sexual irregularities.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   Indeed, there is the angels of heaven there
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   neither marrying nor giving in marriage.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   None of the things which men delight in and gloat over,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   none of the things by which they live,
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   they're all shut out of heaven.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   My friend, if you were to go to heaven as you are,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   it would be the deepest hell to you.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   If you find listening to a sermon boring,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.200]   what on earth would you make of heaven, my wonder?
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   If you find the Bible a boring book,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   what would you do in heaven?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   If you find a prayer meeting an insult to your intelligence,
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   what would you do in heaven, my friend?
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   No, no, if you want to go to heaven, you must be born again.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   There is a city bright,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   closed are its gates to sin,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   nor that defileth, nor that defileth,
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   shall enter in.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   That's why a man must be born again.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   It's clear, sheer logic.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   It's inevitable when you realize the truth
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   about God and heaven and yourself.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   So I end with this.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   What then is regeneration?
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Well, my dear friend, you see, it's just the thing
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   that puts you into a condition in which you can
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   have fellowship with God and enjoy it.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   It's the thing that prepares you for heaven.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   What is it?
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   Well, it's nothing that you and I do.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   We can't do it.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   The very term tells us that.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   It's no use saying that you can change yourself.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   You can't.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   We've all tried that, haven't we?
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   You can't do it.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   Can the Ethiopian change his skin of the leopard?
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   He spots, of course he can't.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   What's the value of all our foolish resolutions?
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   It's no use saying you must change yourself.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   There are people who claim that that's Christianity,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   that you change.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   He changed himself, they say,
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   but you can't change yourself.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   You can change the externals.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   You can drop this, put on that.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   That's not changing yourself.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   And being a Christian doesn't mean that you take up religion.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   It doesn't mean that you add certain things to your life
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   and subtract others.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   Oh, what is it?
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   The very term defines it.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   You must be born again.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   A baby doesn't give birth to itself.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   The mother gives birth to the child,
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   and you and I have got to be born again.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   It isn't something that we do,
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   it's something that happens to us.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   And I'll tell you more about it.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   It's a miracle.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   It's a marvelous thing.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   It's a supernatural act.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   That's why our Lord says to Nicodemus,
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   "Marvel not that I say unto thee,
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   ye must be born again."
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.200]   "My dear Nicodemus," he says,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   "are you mad enough to try to understand this?
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   Listen, men.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   This is the sort of thing I'm talking about.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   The wind bloweth where it listeth.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   Thou hearest the sound thereof,
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   but canst not tell whence it cometh,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   nor whither it goeth.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   You look down at that cell,
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   you make your analysis,
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   you see this marvelous something,
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   but where does that come from?
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   What's at the back of it?
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   It's God, and this is rebirth.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   The hands of the Creator of the universe,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   through the Spirit,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   are again taking hold of you,
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   remolding you, refashioning you.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   It's a miraculous action.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   It's a marvelous action.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   It's like the wind.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   It's secret, it's deep,
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   it's in the depths of the soul.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   It is God, the Holy Spirit, I say,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   doing this profound work
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   in the very being of a man,
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   and making of him something
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   that he wasn't before.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   It's a reconstitution.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   Now, these are the terms that are used
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   in the New Testament itself.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   Listen to the apostle putting it like this.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   He says, "Ye are the epistles of Christ,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:53.200]   ministered by us, written not with ink,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   but by the Spirit of God,
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   not on stones,
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   but on the fleshy tables of the heart."
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   The difference between morality and Christianity
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   is just that.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   Morality is written on stones outside you.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   The Ten Commandments,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   written on stones, with ink as it were.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   But this is entirely different.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   This is something that is done
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   in the fleshy tables of the heart,
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   down in the depths of a man's personality,
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   and it is done by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   Listen to another statement of it.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   "God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness,
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   hath shined in our hearts
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.200]   to give the light of the knowledge
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   of the glory of God
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   What's to be born again?
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   Well, it's that God does the sort of thing
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   he did in the creation at the beginning.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   He said, "Let there be light,"
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   and there was light.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   He says, "Let there be a new creature,"
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   and there is.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   "And God, who shined,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   caused the light to shine out of darkness,
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   hath shined into our hearts
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   to give the light of the knowledge
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   of the glory of God
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   So the apostle goes on to say,
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   by an inevitable logic,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   "If any man is in Christ Jesus,
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   he is a new creature, a new creation.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   Old things are passed away.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   Behold, all things are become new."
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   It means a man has a new nature.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   He has a new heart.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   A stony heart is taken out.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   A heart of flesh is put in its place.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   It means that a man is given
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   an entirely new disposition.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   It doesn't mean that he is given
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   faculties and propensities
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   that he didn't have before.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   But what it does mean is
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   that his whole outlook is changed.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   Something vital that controls
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   all the faculties and the movements,
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   that is changed.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   So he is an entirely new man,
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   and these are the results.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   He now has a completely different outlook.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.200]   It's all typified perfectly
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   in the case of the apostle Paul himself.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   The violent persecutor of the church
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   becomes its greatest preacher.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   He's turned right about.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   He was able as a persecutor.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   He's equally able as a preacher.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   He was zealous as a persecutor.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.200]   He's equally zealous as a preacher.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   The faculties are not changed,
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   but the whole man is changed.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   His outlook is changed.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   He now minds different things.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   He no longer minds the things of the flesh,
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   but the things of the spirit.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   He's got different interests.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   He now begins to understand the gospel
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   that he ridiculed before,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   that natural men will receive,
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   if not the things of the spirit of God,
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   because their foolishness unto him.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   He now thinks it's the most wonderful
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   and the most glorious thing in the world.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   How he could have been so blind.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   He can't forgive himself for being so foolish.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   He understands.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   He says, "I have the mind of Christ."
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   And still more wonderfully,
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   he begins to love the law of God,
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   which he formerly had hated.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   John the apostle is able to say
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   in his first epistle in chapter 5,
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   "And his commandments are not grievous."
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   The commandments of God, as I've reminded you,
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   are grievous to every one of us by nature.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   We hate them as the children of Israel hated them.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   And we want to go and lust after other things.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   We hate the ten commandments.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   But when you become a Christian,
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   when you're born again,
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   you love the law of God.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.200]   His commandments are not grievous.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   And you know,
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   you begin to enjoy spiritual things.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   You begin to enjoy the Bible.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   You begin to enjoy prayer.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   You begin to enjoy communion with God's people.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   You begin to enjoy communion with God himself.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   You begin, sir, to enjoy these things,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   that you'd give everything if only you could retain these.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   They have first priority.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   They're the biggest thing in your life.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   That's what happens to a man who's born again.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   And this, you see, is the tragedy and the condemnation,
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   that the whole world isn't yet rejoicing in this tonight.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   Can't you see, my dear friend,
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   that this is the most wonderful thing of all?
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   If Christianity were just another kind of law,
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   if it just held before me the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   and said to me,
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   "Well, now, if you live life like that,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   you'll become a Christian and you'll go to heaven,"
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   I would be completely undone.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   I couldn't do it.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.200]   Neither could you.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   Our Lord's interpretation of the ten commandments
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   makes it utterly impossible to every man.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   It was meant to do so.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   What if the Gospel were what so many people want it to be,
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   saying, "Do this and you'll make yourself a Christian"?
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   Thank God for the Gospel that preaches a rebirth.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.200]   Why?
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   Oh, well, you see, this gives hope for everybody.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   If it's God's work, he can do it in me as well as anybody else.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   If a man makes himself a Christian,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   well, then some people have great advantages over others.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   Some are born nicer people than others.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   Some are born with a devilish nature.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   We're all devils, as I've said,
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   but some are more devilish than others.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Some people are naturally good and phlegmatic and quiet and kind,
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   and others, oh, we're just glutted in evil, as it were.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.200]   And if it depends upon us, what an unequal count is.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   But, you see, here's a message that tells you that we're all hopeless,
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   and that it's God alone who can put us right,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   because it's a job for him, there's a hope for every one of us.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   God can save anybody.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   God can put this new life into anybody,
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   into everybody that he chooses to do so.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Thank God for a Gospel of a rebirth.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   Here's the only place in which there is a hope for all,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   and he can make the foulest clean.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   He can answer the prayer of David and give us a clean heart
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   and renew a right spirit within us.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   Thank God that it's his, the Creator's action,
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   and he makes us new, gives us new outlooks and dispositions,
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   new desires, new hopes, new everything.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.200]   Thank God for what it makes of us even in this world.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   Thank God to be delivered from the thralldom of the world.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   That doesn't say that we as Christians are perfect,
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   but it does say this, we are not controlled by the world.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   I thank God that I'm immune to the court circular.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   I'm immune to what polite society does.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Thank God I have the freedom of the children of God.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   I am not, my life is not determined by the thing to do.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   And he gives you that freedom in this world,
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   freedom from the tyranny and the bondage of sin, Satan,
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   And he makes us sons of God,
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   and because we are sons of God, we are heirs of God,
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   He gives us that in the here and now,
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   but look into the future, look into eternity.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   All the things that are awaiting those who are born again.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, says Peter,
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   who hath begotten us again into a lively hope
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   and that fadeth not away,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   reserved in him by God for us who believe in him,
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.200]   the glory of eternity,
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   the entrance of the children of God into the heritage,
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   the world to come and its everlasting glory.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   That's what it prepares us for,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   children of God, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   What would heaven be to you if you were suddenly ushered into it now at any moment?
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:12.200]   Are you ready for the vision of God?
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   Are you ready for the purity and the glory and the holiness of heaven?
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   My dear friend, you must be born again.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   You can be born again.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   Do you want to be born again?
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   If you do, go to God and say,
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   "Create within me a clean heart, O God,
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   God, have mercy upon me, a sinner."
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Ask him to shine into your hearts,
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   the God who commended the light to shine out of darkness at the beginning.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   Ask him to shine into your heart to give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   My dear friend, if you've but had a glimmer or a glimpse
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.200]   of the glory of this knowledge of God
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   and the feeling of new life within you,
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   partaker of the divine nature,
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   you wouldn't hesitate for a second.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   You would begin to enjoy it now,
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   and you would know for certain
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   that whatever this old world may do to you,
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   it can never rob you of entering into that eternal inheritance
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   which God has prepared for them that love him.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   And you will find yourself beginning to mind
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   spiritual things, heavenly things,
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   the things of God.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   You will have become a child of God
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   and an heir of the everlasting glory.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   Ye must be born again.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   Amen.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
