[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   I can't see what's on your hat. What does it say? Super gut?
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.800]   One of my most exciting companies called Oh, hollow. Oh,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000]   Mahalo. I still have Mahalo calm. No, not Mahalo. unrelated,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   completely unrelated. Nothing whatsoever to do with Mahalo. I
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.880]   remember Mahalo great product. Sorry, didn't
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.040]   become like up against, you know, we were making $10 million
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.560]   in revenue at the peak. Yeah, and 100 people writing, like
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.400]   human curated search result pages.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.560]   I remember that. Look at Chad, she's doing so well. You're a
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120]   great guy to reference the chat GPT thing coming out of that.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.800]   Well, then what happened was they did the Panda update and we
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.400]   went from 10 million down to 500,000 in revenue overnight.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.640]   What was the Panda update?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.880]   They looked at who the top sites were. He how hollow, etc. And
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.440]   they just said nobody can get any more than this amount of
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.320]   traffic. And they literally throttled the number of unique
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.400]   users they would send to you. And that was it game over. And
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.440]   then everybody I knew at Google wouldn't return my emails. And
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920]   they were like, we don't have partnerships with anybody. That's
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.720]   what Matt cuts told me.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.920]   Are you saying that Mahalo is lack of success had nothing to
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.240]   do with the poor product execution. It was Google's
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.080]   malfeasance.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.480]   It got really rave reviews. It was backed by Sequoia.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.040]   The movie, but it's
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   you know, when you build a company that gets to 10 million
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.400]   in revenue in 18 months, you can talk to him off. But basically
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.800]   looking at your resume here, I see that you've created nothing
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.760]   in your entire career.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.200]   When you get in the arena, the arena, and you actually build a
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.280]   product, then you can talk to me. I had the number one blog in
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   the world, one of the top five tech magazines in the world. And
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.880]   this is the number one tech and business podcast.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.760]   I touched a soft spot. I got to the warm underbelly there.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.200]   Jake out so rarely goes after Chamath when he does. It's just
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   gold. It's like, it's incredible.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.280]   You're talking to three founders here, Chamath. You're the odd
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.120]   person out. So when you want to talk about product, then make
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.840]   one. Okay, so gross.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040]   And yet I'm the richest. It's so tilting. It must tilt you
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.920]   totally fine. So Kim Jong Un, so Putin. Okay, there's a lot of
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   rich people in the world. But these are three product. Okay,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.640]   dictator. There's your cold open. Let's go.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.040]   Rain Man David.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.520]   Love you.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.560]   We
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   All right, let's get started. Everybody. It's been a big week.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960]   There's a lot to talk about might be a little bit of a
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.080]   controversial spicy agenda today here on the all in podcast with
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   me again. The Sultan of science, who is tearing up the YouTube
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.520]   comments, everybody asking the Sultan of silence to contribute
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.160]   more and to speak more. But when he does speak, my lord, he
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.720]   drops those knowledge bombs. How you doing Sultan of science?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.800]   I'm hanging in there.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.720]   You're hanging in there. Okay, well,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.960]   I'm hanging in there.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.680]   Man, a few words, I guess hanging in there. Okay, great.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.640]   With us again, of course, another Android David Sachs.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.120]   Sachs, how are you doing?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   I am doing fine. How are you? Let me ask GPT. What's the
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   question?
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.400]   How are you doing?
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.440]   Let me ask you to hold on. Let me see what it says.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.480]   I mean, basically, chat GPT for is the ultimate Asperger's
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.240]   equalizer. You guys are going to benefit most from this.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.440]   I asked it. How are you? It says as an AI language model, I
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160]   don't have feelings or consciousness. So I don't
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.240]   experience emotions, or states of being like a human does.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   However, I'm here and ready to help you with any questions or
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   topics you'd like to discuss. How can I assist you today?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.560]   That's pretty similar to how you feel, except you don't offer to
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   help anybody. Okay. Also, with us is the dictator himself.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.800]   Here to talk about topics.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400]   Looking forward to today's episode. And with us the
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.920]   dictator with a shockingly, shockingly low cut.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640]   There's only one button on the shirt.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   Only one button. Okay, made from a tiny baby like right here.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.600]   They were like, should we put buttons in there? Like,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.360]   wipe the buttons, wipe the button conservation movement.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480]   Exactly. No, no, no, no, the one button is what counts. That is a
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.080]   baby albino rhinoceros that was killed, fed to Chamath on his
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   vacation and then attached to his linen shirt. I guess let's
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.960]   just get this out of the way. Trump was a rain, I guess is the
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   term he was charged in New York with 34 felony counts of
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.440]   falsifying business records. Alvin Bragg alleged Trump
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.360]   orchestrated a catch and kill scheme as well to suppress
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.800]   damaging information before the 2016 election. Of course, Trump
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.480]   pleaded not guilty and did a feisty press conference or
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.240]   speech rally at Mar-a-Lago after that prosecutors say the scheme
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.640]   involved falsifying business records to conceal payments to
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   stormy Daniels. We know all that. Same thing Michael Cohen
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.880]   went to jail for the indictment wasn't a speaking indictment,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.800]   where it explained all the details. So Alvin Bragg hasn't
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.240]   tipped his cards by explaining in detail what the legal
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.600]   theories are, and which information he has. And he was
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.040]   pretty clear about that, that he was not going to tip his cards,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.600]   which makes us even more hard to understand what's going on and
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   creates even more divisiveness. Predictably, the right is
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.640]   framing this as a witch hunt. But surprisingly, many on the
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.200]   left, including former SDNY head, Preet Bharara of the
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.280]   amazing podcast, stay tuned with Preet, which I love. He felt
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.080]   this was the weakest of the four major investigations that Trump
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.880]   is under and he expressed some concerns on his podcast that it
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.480]   was light and not detailed. And he might have not actually
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.840]   pursued this unless he had a 99% or something like that chance
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.080]   because it is the President's sacks, I guess everybody's
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.960]   expecting us to fight over this, but to just be a little
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.240]   preemptive here. As much as I think Trump is like the most
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.840]   unethical person to ever hold the office, this does seem a
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   little light. And I'm hoping Bragg has the goods on him
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.760]   because why bring a Mr. Meener case? You know, and these are
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.240]   all I guess, Mr. Meener's that are being elevated to felonies
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.000]   because of tax evasion, possibly or election interference. So
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.360]   what are you a steel man, or just generally speak about the
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   case here? Because I know that you're a man of law and order.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.120]   Well, many people on the left are criticizing this case.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.800]   Jonathan Chait, who's a liberal writer for the New York
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.520]   magazine, wrote a good column about it. And look, here are the
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.160]   reasons why. Number one, the underlying behavior here is that
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.280]   Trump engaged in a private settlement with Stormy Daniels.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.000]   That's not illegal, even if it is, you know, so called hush
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   money, that is legal, you're allowed to do that. Number two,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.280]   is that he used personal funds to do it. He did not use
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.800]   campaign funds. And this is why Alvin Bragg has had to make this
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.000]   kind of distorted, ridiculous claim that he should have used
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.400]   campaign funds to do it. But does anyone believe that if
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.520]   Trump had used campaign funds, that wouldn't be alleged as the
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.800]   crime? So he's kind of damned if he does damned if he doesn't
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.040]   here, I think that you know, what the law is trying to do
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.440]   with these rules around campaign funds is protect donors from
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   candidates misappropriating them. And Trump had every right
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.240]   to use personal funds to engage in the settlement. It's a major
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.640]   distortion of campaign finance rules. Third, these campaign
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.120]   finance rules are federal laws. They're not state laws. So it's
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.240]   not up to Alvin Bragg to enforce them. And in fact, the feds
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.520]   looked at this and decided not to prosecute it. Because if they
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.440]   did, they'd have to enforce similar laws against Hillary
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.880]   Clinton recall that Hillary Clinton had a problem where she
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.920]   used campaign funds to fund the payment to Christopher Steele
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.280]   to write the Steele dossier. And that was a real problem. And it
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.880]   was miscategorized as legal fees. And she had to pay a fine
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.120]   for that. But no one talked about locking her up over it. And
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.840]   no one was talking about, you know, indicting her and sending
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.080]   her to jail. And so part of the reason why I think the feds
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.520]   didn't want to look at this is because they'd have to look at
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.840]   similar cases that are even more egregious. And then finally, the
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.680]   last thing is that we're well past the statute of limitations
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.000]   on this whole matter. So Alvin Bragg is really out here on a
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.480]   limb, he's passed the statute of limitations, he's enforcing laws
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   are not his business to enforce their distorted interpretations
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.760]   of those laws, and the underlying conduct here is fully
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.960]   legal. So I think everybody is kind of like wondering why he's
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.480]   doing this. And I think there's two theories either Alvin Bragg
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.960]   is incredibly stupid, which is not or is incredibly smart. And
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.480]   the the sort of three dimensional chess explanation
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   that Ann Coulter has is that this is all a giant honeypot for
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   Republicans, because they're all rallying around Trump here,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.280]   because they perceive I think correctly that he's being
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.040]   railroaded and he's being he is the victim of a political
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.200]   prosecution. But in rallying around him to defend him, you
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.560]   see that Trump's poll ratings among Republicans in the
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.320]   primary are going through the roof, dissenters are going down.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.600]   And so what Ann Coulter fears is that this is all an elaborate
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.440]   ruse to make Trump the nominee. Because Biden would much rather
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.480]   face a reelection against Trump than against a young, youthful,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.520]   vigorous governor like a dissenters.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.640]   Do you think Bragg has a bunch of more information and maybe
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.600]   that tax evasion is the issue he'll go after because that
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.120]   seems to be the other theory here is he's not going to do the
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   federal, you know, election stuff. He's going to go after
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.080]   the tax evasion, which is what they already got the Trump
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.960]   organization on when why so I guess the CFO is going to jail
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.320]   for six months, it'd be hard to connect. And they did 1.6
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   million fine for that company.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.960]   These are misdemeanor crimes. And to convert them to a felony,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.400]   the crime needs to have been done in the process of aiding
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.640]   and abetting another crime. And right tax evasion is the concept
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.360]   here. Come on, when he listed the bullet point list of all of
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   the reasons that are all of his evidence. It seemed to point to
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.200]   what David said, which is just these campaign finance
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.880]   violations. Yeah, this whole thing just seems like such an
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.640]   enormous waste of time. Just think about the amount of money
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.200]   that will have to be spent on just securing New York City,
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   every time he shows up the five car motorcades, the Secret
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.960]   Service, the police, the this that the disruption to people
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.000]   for what really ultimately I think is right is kind of like,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   you know, it's a bit of like, man, this case should have been
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.040]   brought years ago.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.680]   Well, not at all in relation to that, they were told to stand
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.920]   down from doing that because of the, you can't indict a sitting
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.160]   president. And that's paused. So that's another legal theory
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.240]   that's going to have to be tested.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.600]   Jason, the feds looked at this years ago, and they decided not
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.720]   to press charges.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.920]   They were told to not do it because he was a sitting
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.200]   president. No, they were.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.640]   No, he's been out of office now for a couple of years. Why
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.520]   didn't they move forward?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   They were, that was the process they were doing. So that takes
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.360]   two years. The previous DA said he was told to stand down,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.160]   because
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.760]   Cyrus Vance decided not to prosecute on the same underlying
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840]   offenses. That was his decision. He decided not to. Who told him
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.600]   to stand down? No one can tell him to stand down.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   Yeah, the office of...
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.400]   Cyrus Vance decided not to move forward with this very same
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.440]   case, when the statute of limitations had not expired. Now
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.600]   it has, and Alvin Bragg's moved forward.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.240]   Yeah, that's...
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.400]   I mean, you really have to stretch here to come up with any
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.720]   kind of plausibility to this case. And I mean, you have to
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.040]   wonder why he's doing it. Is it just naked partisanship? Or are
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.720]   they trying to make Trump the Republican nominee?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.400]   Well, here's what Vance said on Meet the Press this weekend. I
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   was asked by the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   to stand down on the investigation. And they were
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   asked to stand down as well, because of the, you can't
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.120]   indict a sitting president. So anyway, all this stuff's going
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.800]   to get done in the wash. I don't think we have to spend too much
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.040]   time on it, because we'll find out, I think, in the coming
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.360]   weeks.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.800]   Do the Democrats actually want him to get convicted? Then what?
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.240]   He's going to be under house arrest in Mar-a-Lago, because
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.320]   he's not going to be sent to jail. And then what then
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.200]   DeSantis actually will win the nomination. So what exactly is
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   the perfect outcome, which is to create this theater, waste
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.320]   taxpayer resources only to have Trump acquitted, just so that he
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.760]   can win the nomination, and then he can go against Biden and
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.640]   lose? This seems so farfetched and idiotic. Move on. Close this
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.120]   chapter and move on.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.040]   Totally. This is ripping the country apart for no reason. And
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.240]   such a stupid case. Such a stupid case. Even the people who
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.400]   would like to prosecute Trump, like you, Jason, I think have a
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.120]   problem with it. And one of the reasons why this is going to be
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.840]   counterproductive, even to the anti-Trump forces, is that by
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.560]   going first with this case, Alvin Bragg is poisoning the
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.840]   well for any future case he might bring against Trump,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   because now all future cases against Trump are going to be
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.720]   seen as painted with the same brush, which is a nakedly
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.520]   partisan sort of witch hunt. And there may be other cases out
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.440]   there that have more validity to them. But they're all going to
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.280]   be seen as of a piece with this sort of Alvin Bragg.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.720]   Yeah, that was Preet's position. I think it's a logical one. I
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.080]   don't disagree. What do you think of the other three cases,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.480]   January 6, the interference in Georgia, where they recorded
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.520]   them on tape, and then the stolen documents and the
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.080]   obstruction of justice? Or do you think all four cases are
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.520]   politically motivated, and none of them have any validity to
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.040]   them, Sax?
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.600]   I mean, look, the question you have to ask is if Donald Trump
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360]   was a private citizen who never ran for president, would he be
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.680]   the target of any of these prosecutions? I mean, he was,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.480]   you know, a high profile business figure for decades, and
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.080]   he wasn't prosecuted like this. And so that's really the
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.320]   question you have to ask.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   And do we want to go to jail? Cohen did go to jail for the
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.080]   same crime. So the answer is yes.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.680]   What Michael Cohen wasn't prosecuted till after Trump was
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.120]   president.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.520]   But I'm saying is you asked if, if he was not, he would let me
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.560]   finish. You asked if if Trump was not a president, if he would
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.160]   have been prosecuted for this crime. In fact, another person,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.200]   Michael Cohen was prosecuted for this crime and did serve jail
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.760]   time. So the answer is yes, he would have been. And they've
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.360]   and they brought these cases, this banking kind of cases, and
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.000]   they brought the other one for the 1.6 million fine and weasel
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.400]   were going to jail. So I think they would actually, but anyway,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.200]   I don't
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.360]   do you think all four are politically motivated is my
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.800]   question to you? Or you think any of them have?
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.280]   Look, I can't I don't want to comment on the other cases until
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.640]   I see what cases actually made and what the merits of them are.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.560]   However, I don't believe that all these prosecutors all over
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.120]   the country be looking at Donald Trump this way, if he was just a
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.640]   private citizen who never ran for office. And I think we have
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.480]   a big problem in our political system. When political
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.720]   disagreements are criminalized, and this has been a nasty trend
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.880]   that's been going on for many years. It was usually, I guess,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.320]   practice against staffers, you know, here or there, you'd have
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.040]   some, you'd have some executive branch staffer would, you know,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.720]   find themselves on the wrong end of a prosecution that ended up
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.640]   going to jail, maybe they get pardoned or not. But now it's
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.560]   reached all the way to the top. And we have presidential
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.840]   candidates basically being prosecuted. And I do not believe
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.080]   they'd be prosecuted if they were not major political
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.320]   figures. And it looks really bad for the political figure who is
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.480]   leading it right now in the Republican Party to be Joe
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.240]   Biden's opponent in the next election, to be prosecuted by
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.800]   one of Joe Biden's political allies. I mean, if this were
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.400]   happening in some other country, the United States would be
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.000]   criticizing it as some sort of, you know, banana republic type
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.160]   move. So this is not the direction we want our politics
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.000]   to go. And look, I don't I don't want to disagree Trump to be the
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.880]   nominee, I support a different candidate. But I think that to
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.520]   be interfering in our elections for Alvin Brackley, interfering
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   in the political process this way, is a reach, and it's
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.600]   setting a horrible precedent for the future. I mean, we're
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.760]   talking about major presidential candidates being
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.200]   prosecuted question then, by local DAs. I mean, why would we
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.880]   want this?
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.040]   So let me ask a follow up question, then do you the DOJ is
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.720]   currently investigating Hunter Biden? And then obviously, that
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   goes up to the big guy with the 10% Do you think the DOJ should
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.960]   be investigating Hunter Biden? Or do you think we should be
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.720]   giving a pass to presidential presidents and their families?
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.320]   Well, the Hunter Biden case, I mean, this is one where you've
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.680]   got foreign governments basically paying off Hunter
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.000]   Biden for political access. Now, that may ultimately be legal,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.320]   because I think influence peddling is kind of a business
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.280]   that takes place all over Washington. But that actually
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.000]   does speak to the integrity of our political system. At the end
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.400]   of the day, would I send a hundred by into jail? No, I
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.800]   don't think so. Like I said, I don't like criminalizing
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.720]   political disagreements. But what Hunter Biden did was
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.920]   definitely pretty shady. And you know,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.160]   Hunter Biden and Trump and his family are both shady is my
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.480]   feeling on it. We gotta get better candidates in here. Nikki
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.040]   Haley, your candidate Chamath raised $11 million last week.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.640]   She's on fire. Freeberg, you want to jump into this and touch
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.800]   the third rail you want us to move on?
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.760]   Let's move on.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.680]   All right. So there's been a lot of Twitter, back and forth about
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.360]   the D dollarization. And if it's real, if it's happening, if it's
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.240]   not last week, China and Brazil struck a deal to trade in their
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.720]   own currencies, the Brazilian government announced the two
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.880]   countries will no longer use the US dollar as an intermediary. I
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.160]   don't know if that's for everything they trade or for
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.840]   certain things they're trading. It'll be a straight one for
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.440]   Reyes trade. China is the top US rival, obviously, and Brazil is
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.960]   one of the largest economies in Latin America. What are your
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.440]   thoughts? Generally speaking, free burger know that you have
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.640]   some exposure here, you know, with your company that I think
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.760]   you spacked recently, and you have some knowledge of the space,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.440]   right? Well, I mean, China and Brazil are pretty sizable trade
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.040]   partners. I think it's around $150 billion a year of
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.960]   bilateral trade. So China historically has made a lot of
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.000]   investments through their companies in railways,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.080]   infrastructure, waterways, ports, and infrastructure to
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.640]   support the agriculture manufacturing economies. In
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.400]   Brazil, and it's a very deep tie. Obviously, the closeness
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   of that relationship, China became a bigger trading partner
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.520]   for Brazil in 2009, surpassing the US. By the way, China has
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.800]   had similar trading strategies in Africa, in Australia, they've
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.640]   bought several companies in Australia, they've made massive
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   infrastructure investments, the currency of trade is one element
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.640]   of a broader intertwining that China has kind of enabled by
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.840]   using its resources to invest in infrastructure development and
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.480]   then participating in the economic value and gain that
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.680]   arises from that. It's still also supports the local country,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.280]   the local population, the local economies in a meaningful way. I
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   think it's worth noting that the anti globalization moment that
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.920]   we're having in the US and it may be a longer term trend
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.080]   doesn't mean that globalization and global trade is going to
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.680]   slow down between China and other really important well
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   resourced nations around the world. So the Brazil China
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   summit that happened a week ago, where a lot of Brazilian
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.760]   executives went to China and had a very deep set of dialogues,
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.280]   but they also signed a ton of agreements on trade. And also in
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.520]   some of those cases, the trade being done in non US dollar
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.440]   denominated currency is worth noting as being that if the US
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   does continue to push for de globalization, we can only
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   leverage our side of those relationships, China will
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.920]   continue to make investments continue to develop trade and
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.680]   continue to develop really deep tie ins with countries around
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.240]   the world. From a resource perspective from an economic
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.440]   perspective, and ultimately, the leverage will sit with them on
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   what currency folks are going to trade in. So you know what we're
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.200]   seeing with the China Saudi discussion around the Petro
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.400]   yuan, which doesn't seem to be really a standard thing yet. But
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.360]   we're starting to see inklings of some deals happening in you
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.840]   want, but it's more related to the depth of the Chinese trade
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   relationship with all these nations around the world. So the
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.280]   more we kind of as the US think we want to de globalize and
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.480]   reduce our trade relationships with other nations, the more you
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.600]   know, we're out of the way and allowing China to do that. I
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.720]   think it's worth observing that the Chinese economy will grow
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.520]   the depth of their relationships will grow, potentially, the
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.600]   strength and importance of their currency will continue to mount
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.400]   as they build these really deep infrastructure and investment
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.640]   tie ins around the world.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.160]   Chamath, what does a party trading in one do with the one
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.280]   did they buy a bunch of stuff from China? What happens to the
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.920]   one? Yeah,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.520]   this whole thing is a huge nothing burger. This is the
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.280]   third deal that that China has done. The other two countries
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.800]   are Pakistan and Brazil. And the reason why is I've seen like
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.720]   people on Twitter now breathlessly rambling on about
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.600]   de dollarization and all of this stuff. And I think if any of
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.920]   these people would think from first principles, the first
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.360]   thing that you would know is that the yuan is pegged to the
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.320]   US dollar. And so as long as it's pegged, whether you trade
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.400]   through the US dollar, or you don't, and you directly go to
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.320]   you want your index to the US dollar, and then you use a
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.360]   dollar swap to convert it into the currency you need. So I
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.320]   don't know, I think this is kind of like a lot of folks who don't
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.720]   really know what's going on.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   What do you think about the, the depth of China's trade
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.840]   relationship? So forget about the denomination of the
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.320]   currency. But the fact that the statistic now is that you can't
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.160]   forget a top trading partner with 120 countries, you know,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.520]   they surpassed the US with many of these countries over the last,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.040]   you know, decade or two in particular, and continue to
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   increase the scale relative to the US where we're kind of
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.920]   decreasing our dependence on on nations and reducing our
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.280]   trading.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.760]   The reason why China has had so much dominance as a trading
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.320]   partner. And the reason why China's central bank has the
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.520]   largest amount of foreign US dollar reserves, about three and
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   a half trillion dollars, is exactly because of the thing
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.200]   that you want to ignore in order to have this highfalutin
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.080]   intellectual conversation. It is pegged to the US dollar. And
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.400]   until it is unpegged in a free floating currency, we will never
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   know what the real market clearing prices and just China
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.720]   has been able to hold on China has been very effectively able
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   to manipulate this currency. Since they were brought into the
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.160]   WTO. In order to engender that trading partner status, they
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.200]   were able to artificially suppress the value of their
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.560]   currency, so that exports from China could gain traction in
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   countries all around the world, you have to take into account
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.840]   this currency peg. And you have to ask the question, where would
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.960]   the currency be if it wasn't free floating? And then what
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.800]   would the incentives be for folks to replace the dollar? And
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.360]   I think that there's a lot of interesting questions that are
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.400]   worth asking. But I think you have to be a little bit more
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.880]   intellectually honest to have the discussion.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.520]   And just for clarity, Chamath, you said they already have these
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.400]   deals with Pakistan and Pakistan, Russia, you met
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.480]   Pakistan and Russia, I think they already have those deals
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.280]   with those two Pakistan and Russia. Right? Okay, good. I
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.720]   just want to make sure it's clear there. Saks, do you have
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.360]   any thoughts on this? Is is this an example of people just maybe
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.280]   taking the Ray Dalio book and it fits a certain narrative and
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.080]   overhyping it? Or do you think this is an actual real trend in
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.600]   the world? To be concerned about?
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.120]   I think D dollar ization hasn't happened yet. But I think it's a
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.600]   risk. And I think there's a bunch of reasons why the risk is
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.680]   growing. So first of all, we have $32 trillion in debt,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.960]   someone has to finance that debt. And the bigger that
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.880]   number gets, the more unattractive our debt is,
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.920]   because they have to be concerned that we're eventually
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.320]   going to monetize the debt, pay it back by printing a bunch of
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.920]   new dollars. So that's point number one is we have these
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:04.680]   massive deficits and debts. Number two is that we have, I
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.080]   think, in the last couple of years really weaponized the
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.680]   dollar. So if you look at like what we've done with Ukraine and
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.600]   Russia, we basically seized hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.680]   of Russian reserves that were held in dollars, we've excluded
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.160]   them from the swift banking system, we've imposed massive
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.240]   sanctions on them. And in fact, we now have sanctions on a huge
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.120]   number of countries all over the world. So we're very sanction
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   happy, all of which makes these countries view the dollar as an
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.320]   unreliable store of value, why would you store your money in
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.360]   something that can be taken away by the US, and specifically by
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.480]   the State Department. So I think this is a major change in the
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   way that we view the dollar over the last couple of years is
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.880]   we're going to use it as a weapon that again, that makes
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.160]   it view that's not the first time we've ever done that,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.920]   right. We've done sanctions against many different
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.960]   we've done sanctions. But as far as I know, we've never seized
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.000]   foreign currency reserves and excluded a country from SWIFT,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.240]   which the banking system, so as as an instrument of US foreign
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.080]   policy. So I mean, I could be wrong about that. But this was a
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.960]   major event when it happened. Remember, we also did stuff like
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.400]   seize the the yachts and the the foreign holdings of Russian
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.520]   oligarchs member, their ill gotten gains, we suddenly
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.080]   decided they were all gotten, let me tell you, we didn't think
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.160]   they were ill gotten when those Russian billionaires were buying
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.320]   those yachts or buying New York real estate or London real
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.640]   estate or investing in Facebook or investing in companies here
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.960]   or buying sports teams or what have you. So we got hold on, we
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.800]   didn't think they were ill gotten at the time that they
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.200]   were actually made and spent. But we decided subsequently,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.840]   we're just going to seize those things. Well, again, if you are
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.000]   a foreign country, or a wealthy person in a foreign country, or
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.560]   just trying to decide where you're going to keep your money,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.280]   you may not want it to be liable to the vagaries of US foreign
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.960]   policy. So I think all these things do matter. And when
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.840]   you're running the kind of debt and deficits we have, and you're
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.000]   making the US dollar less attractive, you are running a
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.200]   risk. I mean,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   that's, we should be keeping people we have disagreements
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.920]   with on the dollar standard, because that's good in terms of
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.760]   power for us, which I think opens us up to a broader
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.200]   discussion.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.480]   Okay, just to clarify this, it's not even the dollar standard,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   right? Like what this deal was, is to use this thing called
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:35.520]   SIPs. And SIPs is the non dollar competitor to SWIFT. And so you
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.280]   settle right across, let's just say you have two trading
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.800]   partners in two completely different countries that use a
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.480]   bank in each of their local areas. They typically swap the
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.200]   dollars and then they transfer right using this this backbone
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.720]   of the financial infrastructure called SWIFT. China has built a
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.480]   competitor to it called SIPs, CIPs. And China has been going
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.960]   around and signing folks up makes a ton of sense, right? Hey,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.760]   listen, if we're trading between each other, let's just use that.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.600]   So I think it's important to not paint this with more of a brush
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.120]   than it should be. I'm not saying that de dollarization
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.920]   couldn't happen. I just think that everybody tries to take one
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.080]   random data point and conflate it all together to reinforce a
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.720]   Ray Dalio point from book three years ago,
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.920]   I do think there's a group of catastrophists who maybe are
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.040]   maybe hoping this happens, or it's great Twitter fodder.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   I think we are headed for some sort of government debt crisis.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.960]   I said that there's gonna be three prongs to this financial
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.560]   crisis. One was these long dated bonds having unrealized losses,
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.160]   which is causing problems in regional community banks. The
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.600]   second piece of it's the commercial real estate crisis,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.800]   which I think is metastasizing right now, which is also going
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   to be a banking crisis once all those unrealized losses come due.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.600]   And the third piece of it is government debt crisis, we have
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.640]   this $32 trillion debt that we're now having to refinance at
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.720]   much higher interest rates. I've read somewhere that half our
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.320]   government debt to 16 billion is going to come due 16 sorry,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.560]   trillion Yeah. And it's gonna have to be refinanced in the
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:13.000]   next three years, the average rate on that debt is 1.7%. Well,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.320]   if you want to refinance it at 10 year rates, you're going to be
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.120]   looking at somewhere between three and a half, 4%, maybe more.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.920]   So you're looking at a doubling of the interest costs. And I
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.320]   also read that by 2030, we're going to have over a trillion
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.520]   dollars of interest expense owed by the US government every year.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.320]   That is money that's not funding anyone. So security is not
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.280]   funding anyone's health care. It's not funding one weapons
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.880]   program. It's not funny. We want it's this the VIG it's gonna be
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.680]   more than a quarter of our total federal budget.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.640]   Yeah. And this is where you start gambling. When you're
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.480]   chasing that VIG payment, you start taking risks. This is also
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.760]   where you have to expect the Fed will really want inflation to
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.160]   stay high. That's sort of what we've said before. The only way
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.200]   out of this mathematically is to keep rates high. But the other
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.880]   thing, David, that you when you mentioned all of this is, what
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.800]   about every other country? If you think that's happening in
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.320]   the United States, I think it's important to make sure we at
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.240]   least consider every other major economy because it's not as if
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.800]   they're pristinely sitting on the sidelines. While this
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.840]   happens to the US. This is my whole argument the whole time,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.000]   which is if you're going to have this argument, you need to do it
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.760]   thoughtfully and relatively, right, because the euro is in
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.280]   the same amount of trouble. If you look across, it's not as if
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.320]   China is actually sitting pretty and smelling like roses, either.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.640]   Every major economy or trading block in the world is going to
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.360]   go through this at the same time. So it becomes a relative
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.640]   trade argument. And there, I just don't know enough to know
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.200]   whether the US is poorly positioned versus Europe or
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.560]   China. But it just seems like you get back to a place where
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.520]   it's like, okay, we need to find the flight to safety. What is
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.680]   the canonical flight to safety? If it's not a commodity like
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.080]   gold, it's probably the dollar until it's not.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.520]   Yeah, okay, freeberg. Obviously, other countries have even more
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.080]   acute problems, higher debt to GB GDP, which means higher debt
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.000]   payments. Just rounding third here on this issue. Any final
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.360]   thoughts on de dollar ization and servicing our debt?
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:14.880]   Look, it's we're in trouble. And it's, it's unclear the timing
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.440]   and the path. But the arithmetic is pretty simple. In addition to
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.480]   the point sacks made, you guys saw the news, the city of
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.120]   Chicago has a $44 billion pension hole. That's just the
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.240]   tip of the iceberg on unfunded pension liabilities from both
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.040]   state government, city government, even private
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.480]   institutions. This is, again, hundreds of millions of people
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.200]   worldwide that are expecting money coming to them from
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.920]   institutions, that ultimately, the federal government of the US
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.800]   is likely going to have to backstop to some degree. So
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.680]   that's another huge check that's going to need to be written, but
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.360]   the federal government is inevitably going to have to
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.280]   write because we're not going to just let all these people have
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.360]   no money and come starving. And Social Security right now is
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   projected to go bankrupt sometime between 2030 and 2035.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.000]   So we're gonna have to write a check to cover the hole there.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.240]   Plus, the interest payment checks.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.840]   So much a mox point freeberg of like,
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.480]   let me just say,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.040]   relative to other societies, other countries.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.400]   Yeah. So the very likely case is that
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   relative wealth will decline.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.960]   So in the near term, I think it's inevitable we have higher
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.320]   tax rates. I've said this before, because in order to kind
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.600]   of meet the gap, even if we have these austerity measures or
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.360]   reduce costs or reduce the budget as the republicans are
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.320]   going to push for is the stat ceiling debate reaches its apex
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.440]   in 60 days from now, which you better believe this is going to
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   be pretty, pretty damn dramatic.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.680]   And there's going to be real questions of what happens if the
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.560]   US defaults on its treasuries, if the US defaults on
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.440]   obligations, it has on treasuries,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:08.040]   there will be a real shift away from using those assets as the
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.960]   baseline of the risk free rate worldwide, what the net what the
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.600]   other thing will be, I don't know. I'll speak about the
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.640]   challenges I see with Bitcoin. You know, if we want to at some
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.000]   point,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.280]   oh, did you hit a million yet? How's
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.240]   Bob, but if you put all of this together,
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   you're gonna have to source income somewhere, you're gonna
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.800]   have to take a piece of the assets and a piece of the income
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.200]   away from the private citizenry. So you're gonna have to tax. And
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.400]   that tax will be used to kind of fill some of the hole. And
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.640]   then more of the hole will be filled by printing money. And
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.480]   that will lead to this kind of inflation of asset values, which
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.360]   ultimately means that the relative cost of things go up
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.320]   and relative wealth goes down. And I think that's the point to
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.200]   take note is that anyone who's concentrated assets is going to
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.640]   have them effectively
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.760]   lost in the washout.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.240]   SACs, you want to add?
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.360]   Well, I just want to add a couple of details there, because
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.400]   Friberg went pretty quickly over a couple of those examples. So
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.240]   just to take that, that Chicago case, the numbers I saw in an
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.840]   article this week, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.920]   was that 80% of the property taxes in Chicago are now going
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.240]   just to pay for pensions. So 80% are going to pay former workers,
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.280]   not current city workers. And moreover, those pensions are
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.240]   only 25% funded. So they've already over promised by 75%
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.280]   benefits that they can't afford. How is this going to work? And
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.920]   you saw that we just had an election there. And rather than
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.880]   fix the problem, they voted for a candidate, Brandon Johnson, who
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:46.480]   is even softer on crime than Lori Lightfoot. And the reason for
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.840]   that is because the government workers unions basically all
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.520]   supported him. So you have a situation in these blue cities
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.480]   and states where there is a massive civil service. They are
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   the strongest special interest in local and state politics. They
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.120]   have already taken huge appropriations out of the state
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.680]   budget in the form of these pensions, which aren't even
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.960]   adequately funded, we can barely afford them as they are.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.280]   Should we have pension sacks? What do you think?
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.480]   Sure. So what what happened in the 1980s, when there was a lot
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.880]   of pension reform in the private sector, as you move from defined
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.200]   benefit to define contribution. So you start having more defined
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.760]   contribution, like 401k. The way that these public pensions work
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.880]   is defined benefit. So, you know, what they'll do is they'll
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.040]   say that we're going to take your last year of employment with
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.760]   the city or state. And whatever your whatever the amount of
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.920]   money was you made that last year, you're going to get 80 or
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.160]   90% of it for the rest of your not just your life, but your
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.640]   spouse's life too. And moreover, any overtime you earned becomes
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.400]   part of that calculation. So everyone knows this game. And so
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.480]   what you see is in their final year, state or city employees
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.800]   will load up on the overtime, they'll earn twice as much. And
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.400]   then they'll get 90% of that. Yeah, they get 90% of that for
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.440]   the rest of them and their spouse's life. We just can't
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.920]   afford to have rules like that, that don't make any sense. And
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.800]   so but the point is that the benefit that's been defined
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.080]   bears no relationship to the amount of money that's gone into
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.000]   these pensions, right. And so you have a simple solution here,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.440]   you have a huge unfunded liability. Yeah. But to
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.120]   freebirg's point, every blue city and state in the country is
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.560]   going to have this problem. And who's going to pick up these
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.280]   expenses,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.120]   you bring up great points, but you just mash them all together
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.840]   in this mashed potato of random things like unfunded pension
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.520]   liabilities, you want remember, re eyes trading, and they're
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.000]   like the same thing. They're not the same thing. They're driven
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.880]   by totally different, but we're talking about
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.280]   throw them in this like, is that amalgam soup and outcomes
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.240]   like conversations, I'm just saying like, if these are
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.280]   important topics, but I'm just saying, I do think they're
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.360]   motivated by totally different things. And they're not related
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.960]   as much as we think they are related.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.920]   I think they're related. Let me walk you through how they're
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.440]   related. Okay, I want to hear how the re eyes you want trade is
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.480]   connected to the Chicago pension system,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.240]   the holes need to be filled. So the money is not going to just
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.320]   not get paid to the pensioners, social security is not going to
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.200]   go away. Just like we saw in France. If you start to do that,
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.800]   you have revolutions in the street. There's literally
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.720]   bonfires at intersections in France in Paris today, because
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.120]   people don't want to wait another two years before they
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.200]   get their pension payments. So ultimately, that check has to be
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.080]   written. When you add up the column of how much money is not
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.360]   on the balance sheet today, how much liability is not on the
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.920]   balance sheet today, that is ultimately going to have to get
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   paid out. And the US government is going to print money to pay
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.600]   it out. It indicates that there is a higher degree of
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.200]   uncertainty on whether or not I'm actually going to get the
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.480]   value back for the bonds that I'm buying in US dollar
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   denominated form, or that the US dollar is actually going to be
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.960]   strong enough to cover the cost or has enough kind of, you know,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.920]   or has too much volatility, because of this uncertainty. And
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.240]   I think that that's really where people start to say, well, maybe
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.720]   the US dollar isn't that risk free rate where it's a strong
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.800]   economy with a great balance sheet, great economic growth,
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.080]   there's certainly extraordinary potential because of the
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.280]   freedoms that we have to operate in this country as individuals.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.600]   Through the enterprise, through the innovation, through the
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.640]   entrepreneurship, through the attraction of talent from all
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.600]   over the world to come here. But at the end of the day, we do
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.960]   seem to have a very big set of checks that we're gonna have to
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.040]   write. And as those, you know, liabilities start to mount,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.440]   there becomes a real question on do I really want to hold
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.400]   dollars, maybe I want to hold something else. And maybe I
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.760]   diversify a little bit. And maybe instead of holding just
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.400]   dollars, I also hold other things. And as that starts to
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.080]   happen, you see a little bit of a shift. It's not an overnight
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.920]   thing. It's all catastrophic one or the other. But it starts to
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.920]   bring into question whether the US dollar is the standard de
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.080]   facto system that's used for trade around the world. That's
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.480]   the point.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.200]   And sacks, there is a solution to this superannuation is done
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   in the UK and in Australia, where you contribute, you're
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.440]   forced to contribute to your 401k, essentially, but you get
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.880]   to learn how to put money away and you become a little more.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.480]   You have a little more authority over your future with these
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.520]   pensions where you're responsible for saving and
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.640]   you're kind of forced to save and it seems to have worked
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.160]   really well in Australia and other places where people have
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.280]   great savings, and you don't have this major debt load by the
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.560]   government doing it. So it's something for people to look
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.160]   into. Saxe, did you want to add anything to this? Yeah, I mean,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   being this one to death, just make it quick. Yes.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.440]   I don't think we're necessarily being there to death, because I
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.240]   think it is a huge issue. I mean, look, the part of Chamas
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.520]   argument that I agree with is that you do have to evaluate the
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.480]   dollar on relative terms. And you know, you can argue that the
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.080]   US and the dollar it's it's still the, you know, this, let's
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.720]   call it the most eligible bachelor in the leper colony.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.200]   You know, nothing started falling off on the man yet. But
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.520]   but that doesn't mean that it won't.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.960]   That's really good. That's really good. By the way, the
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.080]   first default might be the nose is falling. You know,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.520]   the economist Herb Stein once said that if something cannot go
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.000]   on forever, it won't. What we're doing right now cannot go on
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.600]   forever. We are running deficits and debts and unfunded
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.280]   liabilities that we cannot afford. And so it will stop. And
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.880]   the only question is how it stops. Well, I think there's
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.720]   Yeah, and it may stop in a way that is not vault. It's not a
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.880]   voluntary choice by us.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.720]   We crashed the car basically, guys want to make a bet a
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.920]   friendly wager for charity. Oh, what happens in June? I'll make
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.280]   a bet with you guys. June. You mean the debt ceiling? Yeah.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.560]   What do you guys think happens? You think this is going to be a
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.360]   fractious chaotic thing where the markets get roiled? No, I
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.680]   think is going to be a pretty
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.160]   rubber stamp forward deal where they're gonna it's going to come
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.240]   down to the wire. But my guess is no one's going to want to
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.960]   default on the debt. Yep. And there's going to be some
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.840]   concessions on spending. And ultimately, the debt ceiling
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.880]   will get extended. And that those concessions on spending
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.960]   will allow the Republican Party to save face with their voters
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.000]   and say, Look, we, we got some concessions here. I'm not sure
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.800]   they're going to be enough to really address any of the major
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.600]   problems that the US is facing over the longer term. But you
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.880]   know, certainly letting the debt ceiling hit and defaulting is
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   catastrophic. Everyone
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.000]   knows, I think the majority case is a bunch of hand wringing, and
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.400]   then they make a concession
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.800]   that are interested in this topic, I would go use the way
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.760]   back machine, and go and read all of the articles in the 80s,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.680]   where you could replace China with Japan. And what happened
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.240]   with Japan is that Japan just hit a demographic wall, not
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.320]   dissimilar to what China is about to hit in the next 15 or
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:50.840]   20 years.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.000]   Right? It's a good counter argument. Yeah, that's a really
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.880]   good point. And I think that there is this element of, you
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.800]   know, China as the primary threat. But I think the bigger
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.720]   problem, Chamath is that we have voted ourselves into a stupor,
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.080]   we have allowed ourselves to accrue these liabilities that
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.680]   are, in many cases, not on the balance sheet, that we simply
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.760]   cannot afford to pay. And the social unrest that will arise
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.160]   with if and when we don't pay them, or the economic cost of us
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.800]   actually paying them, either of those are going to be pretty
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.680]   significant. But that's under that's water under the bridge.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.880]   And it has nothing to do with China. It has just everything to
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.000]   do with how the US is spending.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.200]   Thank you for being intellectually honest. This is my
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.080]   point. I agree with you about the importance of these
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.360]   unfunded liabilities. I just completely disagree with you
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.320]   that this argument about these things being so hyper connected,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.360]   or that all of a sudden, we're at the cliff of D dollarization.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.800]   I don't think it's rooted in facts. And I think, again, it
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.520]   ignores this unbelievably important piece of logic that
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.880]   all of you guys that say this tend to ignore. And it's still
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.760]   an it's not even well addressed in Dalio's book, which is it is
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:02.800]   a pegged currency. And the minute you unpack it, none of
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.720]   you know what happens to it, except that it probably isn't
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.520]   where it's trading today. And if you actually then have to factor
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.440]   in dollar reserves that everybody holds, that thing
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.320]   would skyrocket in value, and it would crush the export value of
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   the yuan. And it happens to all currencies. And this is this
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.520]   funny thing that has happened to the United States, which is that
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.680]   it ran forward, and it transitioned its economy to a
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.800]   service led economy faster than other countries and other
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.560]   economies and other currencies did. And nobody wants to just
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.000]   talk about that. Except it's the facts. We're talking about
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.160]   that sort of drives us.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.160]   Good. I don't think the big risk is that all of a sudden the
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.280]   dollar gets replaced by the yuan as the world's reserve currency.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.640]   I think freeberg lays out a more intermediate path, which is
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   people start to hedge their dollar exposure. And decisions
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.200]   that used to be automatic, like trading oil and dollars, you
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.160]   know, the so called petrodollar now becomes a little bit, you
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.240]   know, more of a decision. So you know, the
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.280]   sound happened. That's what happened with the pound sterling.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.440]   It was a similar story. And it was not an overnight collapse. I
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.640]   mean, there were certainly these kind of punctuated moments where
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.240]   there were hits. But, you know, the history is that there was a
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.040]   slow devaluation over time. And the, you know, as a result of
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.480]   obviously the economic pressure and uncertainty,
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.640]   you know, what happened to pound sterling was that it was pegged
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.800]   to the US dollar and then it became unpegged. So exactly what
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.640]   I'm talking about. No, even post that, even post that if it's a
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.160]   free floating currency, yeah, you're proving my point. When
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.080]   Soros broke the back of the US dollar, what he forced George
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.120]   Brown, or what he forced the Chancellor of the exchequer to
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.920]   do was to basically depend upon and then yes, you're right. It's
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.160]   been like this ever since. Yeah, that was what I'm saying was not
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.800]   if you let it be free floating, nobody wants to trade in that
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.760]   other currency. Everybody wants the dollar. As bad as the dollar
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.120]   is David's right. It is the worst affected leper in the
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.520]   leper colony. Yes,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.680]   we're still in the colony. This is why you have to have if
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.200]   you're going to be intellectually honest, just have
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.160]   a relative conversation about all of the currencies, and all
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.120]   the things that they're also going through, which are also
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.400]   not not perfect,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   the debt payments for the emerging and the frontier
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.960]   markets are extraordinary.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.080]   Just realize that if you want to go and peg your economy to
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.800]   somebody else's back, they also come with their own trials and
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.080]   tribulations that you have to risk manage as well. And now you
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.720]   have to decide on balance. Do you want to risk manage a
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.240]   centrally governed economy? Right from a central bureau, or
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.680]   a freewheeling democratic like these are all the discussions
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.920]   that people should have? Yeah, there's a lot of choices there
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.040]   just back to the the non currency part of this for a
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.160]   second. There are a lot of like connections between these
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.680]   things. I actually think there is a strong connection between
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.840]   what's happening, for example, in Chicago with the out of
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.280]   control civil service and unfunded pensions all the way to
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.080]   the dollar status. But there's also a connection between
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.880]   commercial real estate and these pensions. So on a previous
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.520]   show, we talked about the commercial real estate looming
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.800]   crisis. And a lot of people thought that, you know, some of
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.880]   the comments we were just talking our book, which is not
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.200]   true. I don't own, I don't have a dollar invested in these
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.640]   office towers. But you know, who does pension funds? Yes, who
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.320]   owns these office towers. So you're talking about pension
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.000]   funds that are three quarters unfunded. And they may have a
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.320]   lot less funds than they even think they do, because we're
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.640]   about to have a huge reckoning, where all of a sudden these
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.160]   office towers that were supposed to be blue chip, that we're
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.360]   supposed to have the best collateral there was in major
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.760]   American cities. Now, all of a sudden, they may not be nearly
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.040]   as valuable as they thought they were.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.200]   Yeah. And, and if they don't own the building, they definitely
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.720]   own the debt 100% for sure. In the fixed income portfolios of
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.280]   all these pension systems are the debt that was used to
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.680]   finance these buildings by the REITs and by you know, the big
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.840]   real estate funds that put those things together. So you're
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.160]   absolutely right. They are 100% impacted by what's about to
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.920]   happen. We're not, we're not going to allow given the civil
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.480]   unrest and social unrest risk. And obviously, as a democracy,
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.400]   we're not going to allow that all to go to zero. And we're not
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.640]   going to let pensioners not get paid. Ultimately, that's just a
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.040]   kiss of death, maybe pension payments are reduced to some
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.640]   degree. But again, Paris is a really great example of as you
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.460]   start to try and shift the economic guarantees that have
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.160]   been made to pensioners even slightly.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.280]   Yeah, what was it two years in retirement? 60?
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.560]   Yeah, and it was certainly like, you know, you could sit here and
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.200]   argue what people for years for their whole life had this
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.400]   expectation set. We have all for our whole careers invested in
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.640]   the Social Security benefits that were owed as retirees
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.540]   through every paycheck that we've received. And those Social
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.120]   Security payments may not end up coming back to us if Social
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.040]   Security is allowed to go bankrupt. So ultimately, the
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.280]   government has to set step in and issue new dollars to make
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.600]   that up. Then the economic question is what happens to the
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.280]   value of the dollar, what happens to the value of the
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   economy, and so on as you issue trillions of dollars to fill
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:04.720]   these holes.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.240]   Let me ask a question that's a little more positive here,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:14.480]   perhaps, which is, is there a path out of this, you know, debt
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:19.240]   cycle we're in? And what are the top ways in which we're going to
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.280]   get ourselves out of this? I have three that come off the top
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.320]   of my head. Hold on, I have three off the top of my head.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.520]   Number one is austerity measures. Number two is
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.720]   productivity through technology. And perhaps number three is
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.200]   maybe recruiting more entrepreneurs here to start more
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.880]   companies and, you know, fill some of these jobs. So
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.560]   intelligent immigration, which
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.880]   number one is higher taxes. Yeah, number one is higher taxes
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.240]   in terms of what's likely to happen.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.200]   That would be a fourth one. That's
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.520]   austerity. Yeah, so look, higher taxes, because you can go after
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   assets, you can go after wealth. So there will be higher taxes.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.240]   Okay. So I still think I still think we'll end up seeing 70%
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:04.000]   tax rates on the wealthiest people 70%. I don't see I don't
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.560]   see it being like unpopular. I think it's going to be unpopular
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.320]   with the wealthy, it's going to be popular elsewhere to fill the
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.880]   hole. Second is cut back on spending. But that's a really
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.320]   hard thing to do. Because, you know, as we've talked about in
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.000]   the past, people vote to get more stuff. So you put the
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.200]   politician in is going to vote to get you more stuff, you don't
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.840]   vote people in to go cut spending. So generally, you
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.960]   know, we're going to likely see number one happened first, maybe
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.000]   there'll be a reckoning where you kind of reduce spending,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.720]   it's going to take extraordinary political will, and an
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.800]   extraordinary depth of education and diffusion of understanding
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.040]   of this, this key critical economic problem amongst the
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.240]   voting class, which is a really hard thing to realize. I think
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.880]   number three, you're saying get the public to understand to
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.520]   understand that we have to have austerity measures.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.120]   Yeah, and then number three, and basically people are going to
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.800]   have to make sacrifices. So the first sacrifice will be the
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.920]   wealthy, they're gonna have to sacrifice through higher taxes.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.080]   The second sacrifice will be everyone else by seeing reduced
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.040]   spending and reduced kind of services, the services, etc. The
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.640]   third is the hopeful one, but we don't have a guarantee on this,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.000]   which is, do we see economic growth through productivity
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.640]   gains? Can we create leverage with our resources and our
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.560]   people by using new technologies to get more with less? And you
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.640]   know, anytime? Yeah, like, again, I gave the example last
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.480]   time, but when a tractor was introduced in agriculture, all
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.440]   the people that were farming the ground didn't have a job
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.040]   anymore. But what happened is new jobs emerged and making
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   tractors and servicing those tractors in, you know, gas
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.960]   pipelines to get gas to the tractors, all these economies
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.000]   emerged as a result of that economic, technical innovation.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.640]   So I think as we see AI and other innovations hit the
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.200]   market, you know, new economies and new industries, hopefully,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.080]   really blossom, and and we can benefit from that economic
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.680]   growth and also lower costs for people on purchasing goods and
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.920]   services. We've identified four things when Reagan came in,
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.600]   wasn't wasn't the highest tax rate, like, like 70%. Yes, yeah,
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.720]   that was the top marginal tax rate is 70%. And 70% is not
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   unheard of, it will happen again in the US. Well, and but Reagan
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.880]   unleashed an economic boom by flattening the tax structure,
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.720]   because marginal tax rates created disincentive for people
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.880]   to work and produce more. And so there is a big economic hit from
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.680]   this. Yeah. And remember what this 1970s were like, it was the
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.280]   Malaise days of Jimmy Carter, we had a horrible economy with high
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.040]   inflation, and everybody was paying high tax rates, and the
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.440]   government wasn't making that much revenue, because there
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.160]   wasn't as much economic activity going on. And during the 1980s,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.440]   we had an economic boom, and the government actually collected
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.880]   more revenue with lower tax rates, because so much economic
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   progress was unlocked.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.280]   Sacks, we identified four things, just like we've learned
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.160]   nothing, which one is the most important here? Which ones are
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.400]   the most important? We talked about austerity, we talked about
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.160]   increasing taxes, we talked about innovation, and efficiency.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.240]   And then we talked about immigration, recruiting more
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.640]   highly talented people, when you look at those four, do you have
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.160]   any to add to that list to get out of this? And which ones do
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.520]   you think are the most important? And why?
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:10.380]   When you look at federal tax revenue, over a 50 year period,
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:15.340]   go look at the Fred charts, what you see is that quite independent
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.820]   of the top marginal tax rate, the amount of federal receipts
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.940]   that the government's able to collect is roughly around 19%,
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:28.220]   plus or minus 2%. And so you can only get so much blood from a
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.020]   stone, you can try to raise the top marginal rates, but then
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.540]   rich people have an incentive to basically find more tax
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.020]   protected strategies. So the history of this thing going back
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:43.620]   50 years is you can only extract so much from taxes. And what
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:48.660]   you're better off is a lower tax rate that is broader based. And
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.340]   you go for economic growth that produces more activity. But
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:55.100]   look, if you if you're spending too much, there's no way out of
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.380]   that.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.180]   So austerity, critically important, and
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:58.740]   entrepreneurship,
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:02.220]   I mean, when Bill Clinton left office, and I think Reagan
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.620]   through Clinton was the biggest 25 year period of economic boom
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:10.780]   we've ever had. federal spending as a percentage of GDP was 18
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:14.180]   and a half percent. He got it down from like 22%. And he did
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.820]   it through economic growth. And he bragged about it. Yep. So you
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.060]   know, look where you want to be is I think, federal spending
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:26.900]   should be in the low 20s. I think you want tax revenue to be
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.780]   in the high teens 19%. You have a small deficit. Those are the
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.180]   conditions for economic growth.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.260]   Jamal, any thoughts here on our way out?
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.420]   I'm going to take the complete opposite of all of this, which
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.700]   is the anti chicken little version, which is I think not
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.340]   much at all changes. I think that jet debt to GDP will
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.820]   continue to rise, not just for us, but for every other country
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.460]   in the world whose fate is worse than the United States.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:02.020]   And I think that on a relative basis, the United States will
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.540]   continue to be exceptional. And that this will not really be an
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.620]   issue in our lifetimes. Okay. And I'm not saying that's a good
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.460]   thing. And I'm not saying that's a just thing. And I'm not saying
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.420]   that's what I want to happen. But pragmatically, I think that
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.900]   that's what will happen. And I don't think that there is a
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.580]   magic number, where all of a sudden things start to break
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.780]   where there's some magic number for jet debt to GDP, where all
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.420]   of a sudden everybody finds religion. Instead, I think that
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.780]   it just creeps higher. And by the way, if you look at where
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.140]   debt to GDP was at the turn of the 19th century, and then what
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.540]   happened through the World War Two, what we've really done is,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.580]   you know, we've retraced a lot as well. So there have been
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.580]   moments where we've been out over our ski tips a lot. And so
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:54.660]   I think it's just important to keep in mind that sometimes what
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.220]   works just continues to work. And I keep asking myself the
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:04.300]   relative question, which is what country, what economy, what
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.180]   group of human capital is better positioned in the United States.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.340]   And despite all of the things that are screwed up with this
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:14.580]   country, it's hard to find a better example. So yeah, unless
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:20.940]   you happen to have the lucky mineral or oil club, like Norway
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.820]   or Saudi Arabia, you're, you're going to be hard pressed to find
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.380]   a better place to plant your money. And I think
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.260]   entrepreneurship and immigration are the two most
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.140]   important things we can do, as well as austerity. And I think
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.980]   Joe Manchin is like it or these moderate candidates in the
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.700]   middle who might actually be able to talk about cutting.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.180]   But by the way, you said something you said something
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.740]   really interesting, which is if you look at Norway, Saudi
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.260]   Abu Dhabi, what are those countries effectively becoming
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.460]   by monetizing the oil, they invest in all of the economies
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.940]   that are working. Perfect segue. Thank you. It's not as if the
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.820]   Saudis and Abu Dhabi and the Norwegians aren't trying to
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.740]   invest in America. They're trying to put as much money to
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.300]   work as possible. They're just trying to pace it out so that
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.180]   they have time diversity and asset diversity. So to your
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.580]   point, Jason, so this is a it's sort of a bit of a self
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.780]   fulfilling prophecy. I think that what has worked continues
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.700]   to work and then the burden for disruption gets higher and
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.940]   higher. Yeah, that changes. There's two things that work in
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.980]   the world, having those natural resources, or having
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.900]   entrepreneurship. Let's make a segue here.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.980]   Well, I have a final point on that.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.060]   Oh, God, we've been final point for 20 minutes here. Go ahead.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.820]   Quick final point.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:28.060]   This is an important discussion, I think. Okay. So Adam, Adam
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.940]   Smith, once said that there's a great deal of root in a nation,
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.740]   meaning it takes a lot of political bungling to screw up
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.820]   something as big as a nation, especially a nation. That's the
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.060]   number one superpower in the world that has the world's
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.620]   reserve currency. So we are, in some ways, the beneficiary and
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.140]   coasting on hundreds of years of excellence of economic
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.620]   performance and great political leadership in this country. And
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.580]   the question to ask is not whether we can still post on
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.540]   that, but whether the political leadership we have today is
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.620]   living up to the standard we had in the past. And I think it's
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.020]   clearly not. And the only question is when it breaks. And
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.500]   it's hard to predict exactly when it's going to break. But
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.700]   what I do believe is that if we keep going the way we're going,
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.340]   it, it will have to stop.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.820]   Well said, we're definitely bending it right now. And when
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.540]   you bend it, sometimes it breaks.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.140]   Right. And by the way, the reason why we are going to
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:24.900]   pursue AI at breakneck speed, even though it may lead to some
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.460]   sort of weird dystopian future is because we need that
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.500]   productivity boost. We have no choice now.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.140]   100%
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.900]   We are so mired in debt.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.220]   And frankly, better us than the next guy.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.700]   And better us than the next guy.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.340]   Whoever gets there first wins.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:41.140]   Another perfect set of words. Two major stories this week that
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.060]   we need to discuss. The first is Saudi Arabia's public
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:49.460]   investment VC arm took a very interesting PR step of listing
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:53.220]   their funds that they have backed. And it's a significant
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:57.940]   list. Everybody from Andreessen Horowitz to KOTU, not surprising
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:04.260]   there. And Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and Adam Newman
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:11.100]   had a major keynote at a Saudi startup conference, I was
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.500]   actually asked to keynote the next one in Riyadh, which I'm
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:19.260]   debating doing. And then, in sync with that happening, at the
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:25.980]   same time, there's been a debate of should LPS in America be
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:30.260]   backing firms like Sequoia, China, Matrix, China, etc.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:35.860]   Because those firms are now backing open AI competitors. And
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:41.180]   if we believe AI is the big race here, should we as a country,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.260]   we don't we're not allowed to back military stuff, obviously,
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.700]   in these countries. But how do we on this global chessboard
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.140]   decide should we be taking money from Saudi? Should we be
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:56.260]   investing money in AI startups in China? So I think Chamath,
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.740]   you've got a big perspective here, globally. Let's start
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:04.380]   with you. Two separate issues. Any surprises here by Saudi, the
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.940]   kingdom actually releasing the list of who they're backing, and
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.460]   why would they do that at this point in time? And then us
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.780]   investing in China, because we are at a moment here, a
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.980]   crossroads, I think, of should we be engaging or not engaging
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.580]   and building bridges with China and Saudi? You know, for obvious
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.020]   reasons,
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:25.540]   look, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, all of the UAE, these are
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.540]   countries that are really important on the world stage,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.620]   and increasingly so because they manage peace and prosperity
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:36.100]   regionally now, right, they have huge balance sheets that can
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:40.420]   accelerate all kinds of projects all around the world. And so
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.660]   they have to be taken seriously. And so this is a very smart
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:48.180]   marketing move by the PIF, which is to essentially say, look, we
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:53.580]   are an established blue chip LP of the blue chip organizations
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.060]   that you're used to hearing about and celebrating. And I
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.140]   think that's very smart of them. Because what it does is it
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.180]   reinforces the feedback loop that other great firms should be
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.020]   going to them to raise capital when it comes time for them to
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:12.380]   raise their n plus first fund. And so I suspect, especially now
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.780]   it makes even more sense because everything we've heard,
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.540]   Friedberg mentioned it a couple of episodes ago, the United
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.780]   States limited partner market is essentially closed for business,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.220]   they have huge misallocation problems, the endowments are
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.100]   sort of closed, the universities are closed, a lot of the family
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.940]   offices are licking their wounds. And so this is a perfect
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.940]   time for folks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE to basically put the
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.060]   foot on the gas and basically tell everybody, hey, we are open
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:43.900]   for business. So I think that that makes a lot of sense. And I
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.580]   think that it'll be successful, it'll work, especially in a
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.300]   moment now where US dollar flows from US dollar limited partners
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:54.540]   are very difficult and harder to come by.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.700]   Well, and we're also selling billions of dollars in weapons
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.860]   to the kingdom. And we are a major part of our valuable
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.300]   they're a valuable security partner of the United States,
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.540]   they're valuable economic partner in the United States, no
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.820]   different than doing business with any other country. I think
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.780]   it's smart by the PIF. On the other thing, though, with us
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.820]   firms investing in China's AI, it should not be allowed. And I
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.660]   do think that the folks that are responsible for CFS need to get
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:23.660]   a handle on this. Look, I've done a bunch of deals where I
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:27.100]   have had to jump through a bunch of CFS hoops where explain
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.220]   CFS, please. So basically, CFS is the Committee on foreign
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.140]   investment in the United States. Now what that means is if folks
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.940]   want to invest in certain things that are on the list of things,
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.900]   and I'll tell you the things that I've been involved with
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.700]   that that came under CFS, rocketry, and certain chip
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.780]   technologies are so advanced that the United States has very
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.860]   specific rules that limit the ability for foreign actors to
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.540]   invest in those businesses. And in those situations where a few
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.060]   folks invested beside me in some of these companies, we had to go
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.740]   through a process to get CFS approval before that investment
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.540]   was allowed. Now, what's interesting about that is that's
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.900]   about money coming in. But I do think that the reverse now
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.460]   becomes important because if us dollars are going to go and see
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.700]   these extremely complicated advanced technologies abroad,
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.140]   especially into the hands of countries that are frenemies at
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.100]   best of the United States, I think we have a responsibility
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.380]   to have a point of view on that. And so I think Keith Raboi was
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.020]   the one that was very definitive and said this should not be
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.820]   allowed. I do think it is so early, Jason, we talked about
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.380]   this, we're on this curve of fuck around and find out which
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.740]   means there will be some crazy examples of stuff that are very
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.300]   uncomfortable. Yep. I don't think we want us fingerprints on
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.500]   this stuff being perfected outside of us borders.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.900]   sacks when we look at the history of engagement with
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.180]   China, maybe we can take a multi decade globalization
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.100]   perspective here. When you look back on it, the engagement with
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.500]   China created so much prosperity, so much intertwined
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.580]   dependency, iPhones being the best example, possibly we're
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.060]   selling them in China, we're making them in China. China
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.700]   loses Apple as a customer, that would be absolutely devastating
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.220]   for them. And it would obviously be devastating for Apple as
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.020]   well. So when we look back on that, as a general rubric here,
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:29.620]   do you think we enabled a competitor? Or we avoided future
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.900]   conflict because of the interdependency? And where do you
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.260]   sit in terms of thinking about engagement, versus maybe
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.780]   isolation or something in between those two frenemies,
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.020]   best of frenemies, etc.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.460]   The policy of constructive engagement, as it was called 20
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.500]   something years ago, the the idea behind it was that if we
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:52.420]   engage with China economically, and help make them rich, then
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.540]   that they would become more like us, they would somehow turn into
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.540]   a democracy, and they would have tremendous gratitude towards us.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.820]   And we'd become friends. It's not the way it worked out. There
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.380]   were people who warned that this was a foolish approach. So most
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:11.220]   notably, the realist scholar john Mearsheimer at the
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.740]   University of Chicago, Warren back in 2002, that that was not
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.660]   the way this was going to play out. If we made China rich, they
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.580]   would seek to convert that wealth into political power. And
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.180]   then they would act the way that all other great powers have
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.540]   behaved throughout human history, which is they want to
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.180]   dominate their region, and they would seek to push the United
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.180]   States out of Asia. And the future that he predicted 20
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.860]   years ago is the future that's come true. And I think the you
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.500]   know, all the constructive engagers, I think, has some egg
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.580]   on their face. Now, I understand where they're coming from. This
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.460]   is a fundamental difference between whether you see the
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.500]   world in economic terms, which is about creating positive sum
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.420]   games, basically trade, or whether you see the world
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.940]   fundamentally in geopolitical terms, which is about the
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.700]   balance of power, which is more of a zero sum game. And I think
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.300]   that both views, they're both extremely important, we want to
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   engage in positive some relationships that generate more
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.220]   trade and more wealth for United States. At the same time, we
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.660]   have to be aware and concerned about the balance of power, we
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:19.940]   do not want a number two country in the world who can rival the
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.420]   United States, in terms of power, who basically could win a
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.540]   security competition with us. And we certainly don't want a
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.380]   country in the world to be more powerful than us. So I think
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.820]   this is sort of the yin and the yang is geopolitics versus
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.420]   economics. And I think what's happened with China over the
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.940]   last several years is it's flipped, I think we used to see
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.500]   the relationship primarily in positive some economic terms,
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.300]   and now we see it in geopolitical terms. And I think
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.260]   there's a lot of firms now in the United States who haven't
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.460]   embraced this new reality. And to go back to your question
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.940]   about, you know, when should a venture capital firm take money
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.300]   from a foreign country when it should, and I think there's a
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.620]   very simple rule for this, which is, if the country's a US ally,
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:04.380]   I think it's fair game, because the US has said this is a
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.500]   partner of ours. So why can't you do business with them? But
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.380]   if the United States government has said this is an adversary,
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.460]   you're putting yourself in a really difficult, precarious
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.580]   spot by doing business with them,
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.420]   because then you have to explain yourself to the US
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.060]   government. Yeah,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.020]   this is the very simple rule we would use as I don't we would
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   never consider taking money from Russia or China, any country
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.940]   that the US government says is an adversary of ours. But if the
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.100]   US government says this is a partner and an ally, then I
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.180]   think you can consider it.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.980]   Do you think there's a way sacks to salvage the relationship
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.460]   with China and make it productive? Or do you think it's
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.620]   a far gone conclusion at this point, because one might argue,
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.380]   and I've heard people argue this, maybe China would have
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.460]   invaded Taiwan already if it wasn't for the interdependency.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.580]   So I know we're dealing with, you know, a lot of we're doing a
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.420]   lot of predictions here. But do you think it can be salvaged?
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.980]   And do you think it would have been a worse relationship if we
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.140]   hadn't had this interdependency that's been built up?
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.600]   I'm not quite sure that the economic interdependence theory
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.920]   preventing war has been definitively proven. If you go
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.040]   back to World War One, for example, it was the case that
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.480]   Britain and Germany actually were each other's number one
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.440]   trading partners, and they still got in World War One, for
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.380]   reasons that in hindsight seem really silly. So I'm not sure
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.220]   that economic interdependence can prevent, it certainly
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.880]   doesn't prevent security competitions from arising. And
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.780]   therefore, I don't think it can necessarily prevent a war.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:36.220]   Although, you know, having business ties can lead to
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.580]   positive interactions. Yeah, so I'm just saying the jury's still
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.180]   out on that. But I think that, like I said, I think once you're
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.120]   in a security competition, the way that we are with China, I
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.620]   think geopolitics rather than economics is in the driver's
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.460]   seat. And
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.520]   Freiburg intellectually way, I think to process this, you would
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.140]   never invest in a North Korean AI company, a Russian AI company
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:04.900]   or an Iranian AI company. How do you think about China, and then
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.500]   just generally this topic of when to engage when venture
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:13.380]   capitalists when startups, you know, and trade partners should
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.620]   engage with various countries? How do you think about a
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.020]   Freiburg? In what role as an investor? Well, we could we
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.240]   could take multiple roles here. Founder investor would be the
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:28.220]   top two for this program, I think. Or taking money from any
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.220]   of those three possibilities, very few
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:34.100]   portfolio companies that don't benefit some way from the trade
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:40.140]   relationship with China. So, you know, to sexist point, I'm not
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:46.340]   sure you can really say China is a true and complete adversary in
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   the sense that we're on opposite sides. There's obviously deep
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:54.140]   interdependency. So, you know, it's hard to kind of say, I draw
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.960]   the line at this kind of technology investing there, but
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.540]   I benefit from their technology investing that's going on there
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.340]   in other ways with some of my other businesses. Right? I think
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.300]   that that's really where you kind of run into a bit of a
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:13.580]   conundrum that we do have a deep interdependency. So, you know,
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.700]   like with respect to like investing in China, I don't know,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.260]   I think the investing in China thing, it's pretty difficult
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:24.340]   given that there is a single power that gets to decide what
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.820]   does or doesn't happen. I mean, look at what happened with
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.940]   Alibaba. A lot of shareholders got pretty wiped out there.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:35.140]   These, these governments where you have like, the, the
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.620]   potential of getting completely wiped out by government action
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.980]   is a pretty scary place to invest in general, I'd be more
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.020]   oriented as an investor around those concerns than I am about,
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.620]   you know, it's really hard to do the calculus on on Am I helping
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:53.420]   or hurting America versus China? You know, you could argue 100
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.660]   ways each of those sides.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.620]   What do you think of sexes framework? If we're partners?
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.700]   You know, fair game, if not partners, not a good idea to put
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.180]   your neck out.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.420]   But we're part sorry, are you asking? Are you saying like,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.700]   we're not partners with China?
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.260]   Well, it seems like the US government has said we're
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.940]   adversaries now, and that we're in a pretty dogged competition.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.940]   Well, Jake, I'll just be specific. I'm talking about a
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:20.220]   situation in which you're taking money from them. Yes, in a
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.540]   situation where you're taking money, I do think that selling
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:28.540]   them products that are, you know, not like super strategic,
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.860]   like I think selling them our most advanced chips is
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.940]   dangerous. But, you know, I look, I think if you're selling
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.580]   them products that help restore the trade deficit, and correct
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   that movie, I don't have a problem with that. Yeah, I don't
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.060]   have a problem with selling movies or cars or something like
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.660]   that to China. The question is, though, I think if you're a
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.980]   venture capital firm, do you take their money? That's what I'm
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.580]   specifically talking about. And I think whether you're allowed
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.220]   to or not, we don't because we just don't have to think about
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.820]   what complications that could cause down the road.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.660]   Also getting your money out of China also a difficult task, it
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:06.260]   seems these days. Cash App creator Bob Lee, aka crazy Bob
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.580]   on Twitter, that was his Twitter handle was stabbed to death
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.940]   tragically in San Francisco earlier this week. He was
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:16.620]   squares for CTO. He worked at Google on Android. He was the
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.100]   chief product officer at mobile coin. Also an angel investor in
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:24.020]   a ton of companies figma space x clubhouse. Well known in the
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.340]   industry. Officers responded at about 235am to report of a
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:33.940]   stabbing on the 300 block of Main Street and arrived to find
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.780]   Lee who had been taken to a hospital and succumb to his
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:40.300]   injuries there. No arrests has been made. A lot of San
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.940]   Francisco. Politicians are sending their thoughts and
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.420]   prayers. But obviously, San Francisco is still very
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.060]   dangerous place, it seems. Any thoughts on this and how it
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:58.860]   might act as some sort of crossroads or not? And thoughts
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.180]   and prayers, obviously to his family.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.020]   Like I think this
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:06.660]   was a pretty tragic event. There's a lot of people who I
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:10.060]   knew that were pretty close with him. I got several messages on
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.420]   his passing. He was I didn't know him. Personally, I think we
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.820]   met maybe once or twice. He worked on Android at Google and
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.020]   obviously had a key role at square in the early days and was
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.660]   a pretty impactful and important person. But also supposedly, I
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.140]   didn't know him very well again. But everyone says just such an
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.620]   incredibly kind and generous person. So tragic loss. I used
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:35.460]   to live two blocks from where the the event happened. I'll
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.060]   zoom out.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.620]   Where is it? Is it a bad place in Soma at Rincon Center?
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.860]   Right by the big condo towers there. And that's right where
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:47.900]   the Salesforce offices used to be. And, you know, block from
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.500]   the waterfront.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.620]   Is it part of all that drug craziness?
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.740]   No, so it's not in the heart of the camping district. It's just
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.660]   a nice area. And so I'm a quiet area, right? So at night,
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.140]   there's no one there. I went to San Francisco a few weeks ago,
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.100]   I told you guys I pulled up to a restaurant on the Embarcadero
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.500]   and I joked with my buddy in the car. I'm like, Oh, my car is
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.060]   gonna get broken into while we're at dinner because I'm
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.300]   parking on the street. We went to dinner 90 minutes later came
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.860]   out. Of course, my car been broken into the trunk had been
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.020]   popped up. And it's just like,
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.540]   this is a fancy area of Soma, Chamath. Very fancy area of
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:18.900]   Soma.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.420]   Look, here's the thing. If you park at a parking meter in San
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.780]   Francisco for eight minutes too long, you get a 60 to $100
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:28.100]   parking ticket. And San Francisco has become an upside
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.820]   downtown. What I mean by that is I think that like so much of the
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.460]   response that we've had in the last couple of years to power
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.060]   dynamics and concerns about the powerful having too much
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.220]   influence over those who are less powerful, who have less
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.700]   influence and who suffer as a result of their demeaned
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.820]   influence. The response has been to turn things upside down,
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.580]   which is to give those who are lacking in the power structure
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.340]   everything and to try and take everything away from those who
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.860]   are at the top of the power structure. So if you want to
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:03.460]   deal drugs in the open air, if you want to walk into Walgreens
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.820]   and steal 1000s of dollars of goods and walk out, nothing will
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.340]   happen to you, because you were embedded with this powerless kind
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.500]   of position in life. But if you have a car and you park at a
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.740]   parking meter, and you say at the parking meter for more than
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.820]   10 minutes, you get a ticket. And the consequences of
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:23.100]   responding to power dynamics by flipping the power structure
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.780]   upside down is obviously can be more negative as we're kind of
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.260]   experiencing, I think, acutely in San Francisco, but also
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.780]   around the nation. And by the way, I think that this applies
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.820]   in a lot of other ways in terms of how we're doing college
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.340]   admissions, in terms of how we're selecting people for jobs
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:42.460]   in terms of, you know, recent applications for pilots for
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.740]   doctors, where the assessment is less about that the person who
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:50.660]   was disadvantaged at the beginning of their life or
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.060]   career or trajectory, or educational path, be given
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.820]   greater opportunity, and greater resources to catch up and to get
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.020]   there. Or did we just flip the power dynamic upside down and
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.620]   just give them the endpoint. And as a result, there's a massive
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.300]   kind of detriment that I think can arise. And it's not
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   necessarily always the case that it will arise, it is not
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.460]   necessarily the case that selecting someone based on some
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.940]   demographic profiling to be an airline pilot necessarily means
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.540]   that that airline is more likely to have airplane crashes. But in
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.300]   certain cases, when you don't prosecute certain crimes, like
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.820]   robberies, or people walking into stores, or breaking
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.540]   windows, or dealing drugs in the middle of the street, or camping
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.820]   on the street, and you fast forward a couple of years, that
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.580]   power dynamic, the flip of that power dynamic causes the whole
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.500]   town to go upside down. And everyone who's sitting on the
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.180]   bottom ends up becoming a victim themselves. And I think we're
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.620]   starting to see inklings of this in San Francisco, we certainly
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.900]   have for years, sacks has ranted on about this, with respect to
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.140]   some of the non prosecution that's happened historically.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.500]   And I totally agree with him on those points. And I think that
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.540]   it's come to a breaking point in San Francisco. But that's really
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.540]   a beacon for what else is going on. And you know, some people
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:05.060]   call it wokeism. I think maybe this notion of wokeism is one
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.700]   small element or segment of the broader issue with how we are
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.260]   tackling with and dealing with embedded power structure issues
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:15.260]   in this world today. And the flipping of those power
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.340]   structures upside down doesn't necessarily yield the outcome we
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.740]   all want. And I think we're starting to see reasons why
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:24.180]   sacks any thoughts here? That's my rant. I can't disagree with
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.700]   you. Yeah. So similar freeberg. I didn't know Bob Lee, but I
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.380]   know many people who knew him and I was getting texts and
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.540]   obviously, we feel really bad for him, his whole family, his
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.420]   kids, his father, his co workers, friends. We don't know
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:42.220]   exactly what happened yet. But I think we suspect and I would bet
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.660]   dollars to dimes that the story is very similar to a case we had
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.060]   in LA recently, the Brianna Kupfer case, where a young
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:52.700]   woman was basically stabbed for no reason by a psychotic
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.740]   homeless person who had been through the revolving door of
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.580]   the jail and criminal justice system, who could have been
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.140]   locked up, who was arrested multiple times, but was not kept
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.620]   locked up, because of this push for decarceration. And you can
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.780]   argue that maybe it'd be better for that person to be in
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.820]   mandatory treatment, or in a even a maybe a mental asylum.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.980]   But this idea of just releasing these people onto the street, I
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:19.460]   just think is an outrageous abdication of responsibility by
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.940]   our elected officials who run the criminal justice system who
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:26.940]   pass our laws. And the thing I just wish is that I could lock
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:32.700]   for 24 hours, the the people like our supervisors, or
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.860]   governor, or the people who basically make these laws or the
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.700]   people who are pushing for decarceration of these violent
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:42.660]   offenders by these nonprofits, I wish I could lock them up in a
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:47.540]   room for 24 hours with the people that they think are safe
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:52.220]   to release on our streets. Let's see if they really would take
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:56.380]   that test. Because it seems to me that these these elected
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.620]   leaders, and these nonprofits are pushing for these outcomes.
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:06.300]   They are setting loose on us a predatory, criminal or psychotic
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.860]   element that jeopardizes our safety and makes these cities
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.780]   unlivable. And we should not tolerate that. And quite
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:16.580]   frankly, the responsibility goes beyond those elected leaders, it
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.020]   goes to all the voters as well, because we keep putting up with
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.300]   this. And where was our governor when this happened? He was in
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.420]   Florida, doing some singalong at some high school where he was
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.580]   trolling Ron DeSantis, because DeSantis has taken on DI at that
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:34.300]   school. So that's where Newsom was. And he's extremely popular
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.260]   in California, culture wars, instead of saving culture wars
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:42.380]   in a distant state, instead of basically fixing the criminal
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.220]   justice system in California, it's even worse than that,
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.580]   because he's actually shut down two prisons and released lots of
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.900]   people. So where is the push for criminal justice reform in
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:54.860]   California and protecting the citizenry? And until the voters
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.740]   in San Francisco and California start demanding this, there's
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.820]   never going to be a change. And at the same time, listen to Gary
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.580]   Tan, you know, just vote for who are the Gary Tan tells you to
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.540]   vote for? Okay, I think it's a probably good.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.620]   I can't disagree. And this, the supervisor seemed to control a
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.100]   lot of this. And Chamath shared just this week, Mayor Francis
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.300]   Juarez is talking about on his Twitter, the reduction in
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:24.900]   homicide shootings, and they have literally counted the if
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.260]   you want to say, drug addicted, mentally ill homeless, there's
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.340]   obviously three or four different things going on here
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.700]   when you look at the population that's living on the street,
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.820]   some number of them down on their luck, some number mentally
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.420]   ill, some number, addicted to drugs, and some number, a
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.660]   combination of those things. He seems to be getting it done in
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:47.580]   Miami. And, you know, other states seem to and other cities
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.260]   seem to have gotten this under control. Is there any hope for
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.060]   San Francisco to Martha? Or is this just going to take five or
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.220]   10 years to bottom out?
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.260]   I mean, it takes regime change. I think New York had a long
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:02.620]   period of lawlessness, where people were afraid to walk down
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.980]   the streets, it took a handful of mayors to draw a hard line in
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:11.180]   the sand, to increase policing, sometimes to introduce some
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.140]   pretty controversial concepts at the time, or at the time that
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.980]   were supported, which now seem controversial.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.700]   You're talking about stop asking for us,
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.180]   I think it was called the broken windows theory of policing. Yep,
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:24.380]   take care of the where take care of the little things so that the
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.940]   little things don't compound into the big things. But
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.460]   whatever you believe needs to get done. I think it's pretty
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.340]   clear that what is being done isn't working. And so the real
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:42.100]   question is, can people see through the naked partisanship
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.620]   to agree that this is not working? And sadly, what I would
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.540]   tell you guys is that I don't think they're there yet. And the
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:55.700]   reason is because America is the most divided it's ever been,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:02.740]   especially on issues of race and social justice and social norms.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:08.020]   And I think that crime has gotten caught and painted with
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:15.060]   that brush, which means that the idea of very aggressive policing
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.220]   and safety are now viewed as opposite and antithetical to
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:25.220]   social justice. And I don't know how that happened. But the
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.900]   result of it is this, which is these folks will never agree
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:32.220]   that this is not working. And you'll have to go through recall
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.140]   election after recall election. And even then, it's not going to
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:40.540]   be enough, because the smart politicians will say what they
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:46.180]   want, in terms of like, safety matters. But then a lot of
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.660]   voters will vote the opposite. The example in Chicago that
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.540]   David brought up earlier is really interesting, because it
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.500]   was essentially a social justice candidate versus a law and order
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.380]   candidate through their democratic ranks. And the social
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:03.020]   justice candidate won the progressive candidate one and
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:08.060]   the person that wanted to tax businesses and individuals one,
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.780]   and the person that wanted to sort of focus on law and order
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:15.180]   lost. So what does that say? It says that we are still in a
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:19.660]   moment where we can't agree on what is important. Yeah, that's
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:23.220]   really scary. And so I think you kind of have to unfortunately
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.020]   vote with your feet if you're lucky enough to do so. And that's
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.380]   the key. Yeah. Who's left over, or a lot of people who are not
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.820]   in a position to just up and leave. And then they are
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.020]   unfortunately left behind.
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:42.540]   tragic situation all around. And I will never host a conference
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:46.660]   or any event in San Francisco until this is solved. Because I
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:50.740]   look when people ask us to do events. I'm like, people don't
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.700]   want to come to San Francisco, they're afraid. So I do my
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.660]   events in Napa, or in San Mateo,
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:58.860]   Nat Nat started a bilingual school, Italian English that is
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.580]   on the IB system, International Baccalaureate system. And it's a
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.460]   sister school to a school in the city. We had a fundraiser, which
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:11.780]   was literally right downtown in that encampment area. And when I
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.860]   pulled up, I was like, Is this for real? It's an open air drug
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:20.020]   market, where folks are doing drugs, selling drugs right in
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:24.020]   front of you. They're passed out completely incapacitated about a
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.540]   third of the guys are wearing balaclavas. So you can't identify
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.340]   them, you have no idea what they look like.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:33.100]   I grew up in Brooklyn in the 70s and 80s, when it was legit,
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.540]   dangerous. And when I walk in San Francisco, it feels much
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.900]   more dangerous.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.820]   Then the that crazy era,
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:46.540]   it feels random, it doesn't feel like there's organized crime,
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.780]   gang crime, like I grew up in a pretty crappy neighborhood. And
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.980]   you knew who the gangs were, you knew who the tough guys were,
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.540]   you knew how to avoid trouble, it didn't come in randomly, come
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.340]   and stab you to death, right? And so yeah, Jason, you become
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   street smart growing up in a culture like that, because you
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.620]   know how to avoid it, you know how to be alert. This doesn't
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.740]   feel like that. This is just like, a bad roll of the dice,
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.860]   and you could get stabbed to death just walking down the
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:15.700]   street that does not. Where Where are the politicians to
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.380]   stop this?
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.020]   I mean, they don't care. There's the level of corruption in San
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.060]   Francisco is unbelievable. The incompetence amongst those
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.460]   supervisors, the mayor, the DAs, everybody, it's just
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.700]   incompetence. And nobody has the chutzpah or the wherewithal to
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:36.020]   say enough. And I think the other group to blame are all the
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.940]   rich people and powerful people who just haven't been active in
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.580]   politics. And I know some of us have in different ways, but I
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.020]   think it's going to take a coordinated effort by people who
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.340]   really care to vote out all these supervisors and bring in
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:52.140]   it's got to be regime change. And I just don't know if there's
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:55.540]   the wherewithal to do because every time as a person who has
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:58.780]   some means or is successful in some way that you stick your
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.220]   neck out there like you have done sacks, the the attacks that
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:06.780]   you will get from this insane, left. I don't want to even use
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.740]   the word woke. I think it's a different derangement. I think
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.580]   it's actual corruption where they're making so much money
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.180]   off of this homeless industrial complex. They're getting paid so
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.700]   much money that the grift is so deep that they are going to
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.220]   fight for this. And it's going to take some really courageous
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.020]   people like Gary Tan and maybe David Sachs and other folks to
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:32.460]   back a slate of people to change this. And we need people to run
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.980]   for government who are brave and who want to put their neck out
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:37.340]   there and say enough is enough. We're going to police the city.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.300]   I just don't know if it is going to happen. All right, listen.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.020]   Yeah, I mean, the the issue is that it takes it takes more than
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.420]   one election. So listen, I think we made a positive change by
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.380]   removing chase a booty. And I think Brooke Jenkins has the
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.460]   right attitude. She cares about victims. I think she wants to
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:56.880]   prosecute. The issue is that you've got a police department
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.260]   that 30% of the number of officers that they want because
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.740]   they flirted with this whole defund the police movement.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.220]   You've got the board of supervisors and you've got like
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:08.260]   an oversight board on the police that basically make their jobs
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.340]   harder. And it's not it's not one election because even the
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.340]   mayor doesn't control it because the board of supervisors really
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.460]   has all the power in San Francisco. So they take a job
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.660]   that really should be one or two people's jobs like the DA like
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:24.700]   the mayor, and they break it up into this like board of
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.500]   supervisors where you've now got to be familiar with a dozen
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.580]   different races in order to effectuate a change. Well, the
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.900]   machine knows how to do that. But the average citizen doesn't
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:39.540]   so they make it really hard to effectuate change. But there are
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.100]   groups that are springing up in San Francisco like grow SF and
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.340]   you know, people like Gary, who are on top of it and that's why
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.740]   just follow them and vote for their recommendations because
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.300]   they're actually tracking how to make a difference.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:58.140]   All right, I think on that we will wrap for the dictator
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:01.380]   Chamath Palihapitiya, the Rayman David Sachs, and the
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:07.900]   Sultan of science, David Friedberg. I am the world's
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.780]   greatest moderator. We'll see you at the online summit.
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.900]   Love you boys. Bye bye. Bye bye.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:24.420]   Let your winners ride. Rayman David Sachs. And it said we open
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.980]   sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. Love
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:40.180]   you. I'm the queen of Kinhua. Besties are gone. That's my dog
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:48.380]   driveway. We should all just get a room and just have one big
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.580]   huge orgy because they're all just useless. It's like this
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.020]   like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:27:00.540]   What? You're a B. We need to get merch.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940]   I'm going all in.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:10.940]   I'm going all in.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   you
