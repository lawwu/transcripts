[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Well, we love Global Missions at DesiringGod.org, and missions is a huge priority for you, Pastor
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.440]   John.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.600]   In fact, I think as this episode will go live online at about the same time that you will
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.960]   be traveling to Indianapolis to speak at the 2016 Cross Conference.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.520]   So it's no surprise we get a lot of questions from missionaries in the field, a number of
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.400]   questions from missionaries in training, and a fair number of questions from college students
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.560]   who are interested in giving their lives to missions in the future.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.440]   Today's question comes from a podcast listener named Amy, who writes this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.080]   I've recently noticed that the number of women going to the nations far outweighs men.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.880]   I looked for more statistics on this and struggled even to find information.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240]   If this is the case, what are your thoughts on this trend, and what do you think are the
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080]   most probable causes for it?"
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:01.200]   Well, whatever the case among Roman Catholics who have peculiar views about celibacy, whatever
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.760]   the case about Roman Catholics or liberal Protestants who by and large don't do missions
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.800]   in order to convert people to Christ, the case among evangelicals and faith missions
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.180]   in particular is, as Amy hints, contained in this joke.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.440]   Two-thirds of active missionaries are married couples.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.960]   Another third are single women.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   The rest are single men.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.200]   Well, if that went by too fast, two-thirds plus one-third don't leave any room for single
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.840]   men.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.500]   And it's only a joke in part because it's almost that way.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   To be more accurate, the actual situation among most evangelical faith missions is that
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   between 80 and 85 percent of all single missionaries are women.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.400]   It's a rare thing, like two out of every ten, for a single man to make missions his life
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:08.160]   vocation, which results in the overall statistics being that one-third of those in the evangelical
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.680]   world missions are married men, one-third are married women, and 80 percent of the last
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.780]   third are single women, which means that something just less than two-thirds of the total missionary
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.540]   force are women.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.920]   Now why is that?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.240]   And I think the most honest answer would be, "I don't know."
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.840]   And if the research has been done to get the answers, I'm not aware of it.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   So let me just give two opinions, okay?
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.680]   So everybody should know these two things are flying under the banner "opinion," not
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   strong conviction.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.520]   And then I'll end with a challenge to men.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.100]   Opinion number one, let's start with the observation that many single women in missions
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.740]   would like to be married.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.220]   Not all.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.040]   Some regard it as a divine calling to serve as a single woman and has no intention of
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.940]   even hoping or praying toward marriage.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.520]   And I thank God for that and for them.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.220]   But many would like to serve in missions side by side with a similarly called and devoted
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220]   husband.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:40.280]   But by and large, it's men who propose marriage.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   Women have less control over being married than men do.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   Therefore the—meaning they can always say no, but I mean taking the initiative in a
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   positive way—therefore the single missionary woman who would like to be married is not
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.960]   exactly in the same position as a single missionary man who would like to be married.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.800]   Here's a little anecdote.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.640]   Elizabeth Elliott—I went down and got this from my wife because I knew she'd said this
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   once.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.600]   Elizabeth Elliott told of an interview she had with Gladys Aylward, single missionary
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.720]   to China who died in 1970.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.160]   Gladys Aylward, small woman is the name of the biography.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.720]   Here's what Elizabeth Elliott said.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.320]   I think she was talking at Urbana when she said this.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.520]   Miss Aylward talked to the Lord about her singleness.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.600]   She was a no-nonsense woman in very direct and straightforward ways, and she asked God
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   to call a man from England, send him straight out to China, straight to where she was, and
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.240]   have him propose to me.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   I can't forget the next line, she said, Elizabeth Elliott said.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.080]   With a look of even deeper intensity, she shook her little bony finger in my face and
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.520]   said, Elizabeth, I believe God answers prayer.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.160]   And he called him.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.640]   And here there was a brief pause of intense whisper.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.400]   She said, He called him, and he never came.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.640]   Now that experience, I would guess, is not unique to Gladys Aylward.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:46.400]   So that's my first opinion, that the disproportion of single missionary women to missionary men
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:55.200]   is that the initiative of proposing marriage among those two groups, singles, lies with
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.360]   men and not the women.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.760]   Here's opinion number two.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:12.280]   Many, it seems to me, of those single men probably avoid missions out of the same personal
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.480]   dynamics that keep them single.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.440]   Among Christian men who do not get married, say, in their 20s and 30s, they are probably
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.920]   held back from that relationship of marriage by, here are my opinions, a sense of inadequacy,
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.360]   that they could be a spiritual leader, or a fear that they might be rejected as they
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.000]   pursue a relationship, or a lack of purpose in life that would give support and meaning
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.760]   in a marriage relationship.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   Many of those hindrances to forming a long-term commitment of marriage would also explain
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   why he may have a sense of inadequacy about missions, or fear about missions, or a lack
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.440]   of purpose about missions.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:18.240]   In other words, the very things that keep a man single in his late 20s and 30s are probably
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   the same kind of things that would keep him from pursuing a life in missions.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.160]   On the other hand, single women may not feel any of those hindrances.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.080]   They would happily marry a godly, mature, purposeful, mission-directed man if he came
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.480]   along, but they can't make that happen without men doing their part.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:50.400]   Now, I'm sure the matter is way more complex than those two opinions have hinted at, but
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:58.440]   those are possible explanations for the disproportion in the single missionary force, like 80 percent
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.400]   women and 20 percent men.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.880]   So the way I'd like to end is by taking the words of Mike DiLorenzo, who works for
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.920]   AIM, and close by reading his challenge.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.360]   "Yes," he said, thinking of single men as opposed to single women in missions, "Yes,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.480]   it may be harder for men, harder to cut through the lies and the apathy, harder to raise money
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:32.680]   in a self-reliant society, harder to enter into relationally driven cross-cultural missions,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.480]   harder to find your ministry in your vocation.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.920]   But the gospel needs men.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   The Christian life is a battle, so much so that the Bible calls us to put on armor, and
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.640]   the mission field is a battlefield where a man's strengths and passions are called upon
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:00.120]   to be spent for the greatest cause creation has ever known, the cause of Christ and his
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.760]   redemptive work to save this world.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.300]   And I mean save this world.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.320]   It takes courage, courage to step out of your slumber and into the fray.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.960]   It takes humility to be willing to fail or at least be deemed a failure by your peers.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   And it takes strength more than you know, but not more than God is willing to give you."
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.680]   Yeah, gospel mission needs men.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   Amen.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.680]   That's very good, Pastor John.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   Thank you.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.520]   And Amy, thank you for sending in this valuable question to us.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.140]   And thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.120]   Well, the new year is almost upon us, 2017.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.160]   It's hard to believe.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.720]   And with the new year comes new resolve about life patterns and how we want to change things
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.080]   for the new year.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.120]   It also brings with it discussions about our online platforms and how we want to influence
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.920]   others through them.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.200]   And that brings up the question of Christians who are seeking online fame.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.440]   It's an important conversation all digital creators need to have at least once a year.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.240]   And it's on the docket for Friday.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.120]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.520]   Piper.
